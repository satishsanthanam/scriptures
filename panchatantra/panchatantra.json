He had three witless sons who became a matter of endless worry for him. Realizing that his sons had no interest in learning, the king summoned his ministers and said:<br \/><br \/><\/span><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou know I am not happy with my sons. According to men of learning an unborn son and a stillborn son are better than a son who is a dimwit. What good is a barren cow? A son who is stupid will bring dishonour to his father. How can I make them fit to be my successors? I turn to you for advice.\u201d<br \/><br \/><\/span><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 One of the ministers suggested the name of Vishnu Sharman, a great scholar enjoying the respect of hundreds of his disciples. \u201cHe is the most competent person to tutor your children. Entrust them to his care and very soon you will see the change.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The king summoned Vishnu Sharman and pleaded with him \u201cOh, venerable scholar, take pity on me and please train my sons into great scholars and I will make you the lord of hundred villages.\u201d \u00a0Vishnu Sharman said \u201cOh, king, listen to my pledge. Hundred villages do not tempt me to vend learning. \u00a0Count six months from today. If I do not make your children great scholars, you can ask me to change my name.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The king immediately called his sons and handed them to the care of the learned man. Sharman took them to his monastery where he started teaching them the five strategies (Panchatantra). Keeping his word, he finished the task the king entrusted him in six months. Since then, Panchatantra became popular all over the world as children's guide in solving problems of life.<br \/><br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now begins the Loss of Friends (first of the five strategies) series.

As he was resting on his bed one day it struck him that money was the axis of the world and that the more he had of it the more he would be powerful. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Even enemies seek the friendship of a rich man, he told himself.<\/strong><\/span> The old become young if they have riches and the young become old if they do not have wealth. Business is one of the six ways that help man amass wealth. This was his logic.<br \/><br \/><\/span><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mobilizing all his wares, Vardhaman set out on an auspicious day for Madhura in search of markets for his goods. He began his travel in a gaily-decorated cart drawn by two bullocks. On the way, tired of the long haul, one of the bullocks named Sanjeevaka collapsed in the middle of a jungle near river Jamuna. But the merchant continued his journey asking some of his servants to take care of the animal. But the servants abandoned the bullock soon after their master had left. Joining him later, they told him that the bullock was dead.<br \/><br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In fact, Sanjeevaka was not dead. Feeding on the abundant fresh and tender grass in the forest, he regained strength and began to merrily explore the jungle, dancing and singing in joy. In the same forest lived Pingalaka, the lion. Sanjeevaka, content with his new life in the jungle would waltz and sing uproariously with joy. One day, Pingalaka and other animals were drinking water in the Jamuna when the lion heard the frightening bellow of the bullock. In panic, the lion withdrew into the forest and sat deeply lost in thought and surrounded by other animals.<br \/><br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sensing the predicament of their king, two jackals, Karataka and Damanaka, sons of two dismissed ministers, were clueless as to what had happened to their king.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><br \/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat could have happened to the lord of the forest,\u201d asked Damanaka.<\/span><\/p>\n<br \/><span class=\"highlight_quote\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Why should we poke our nose into affairs that are not our concern?<\/span><span> Haven't you heard the story of the monkey which pulled out the wedge from the log,\u201d asked Damanaka. <\/span><br><br \/><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSounds interesting.

Many masons and carpenters were working for the merchant. They took time off every day to go to the town for their lunch. One day, when the workers left for lunch a batch of monkeys landed at the temple site and began playing with whatever caught their fancy. One of the monkeys saw a partly sawed log of wood and a wedge fixed in it so that it does not close up. <br \/><br \/>Curious to know what it is, the monkey began furiously tugging at the wedge. At last the wedge came off, not before trapping the legs of the monkey into the rift of the log. Very soon, not able to get his legs out of the closed wood, the monkey died. <br \/><br \/>\u201cTherefore,\u201d Karataka told Damanaka, \u201cit is not wise to poke our nose into affairs that are not our concern.\u00a0 We have a food store. Why should we bother ourselves about this lion?\u201d <br \/><br \/>Damanaka retorted, \u201cFood is not the center of our life. The elders have said that wise men seek the help of the king to help friends and harm foes. There are a hundred ways of collecting food.\u00a0 <strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What matters is a life full of learning, courage and wealth<\/span>.<\/strong>\u00a0 If living somehow is the goal, even the crow lives long eating leftovers.\u201d <br \/><br \/>\u201cTrue, but we are not ministers any more. The elders have always said that <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>the stupid person who offers uncalled for advice to the king invites not only insult but also deceit<\/strong>,<\/span>\u201d said Karataka. <br \/><br \/>\u201cNo,\u201d Damanaka said, \u201canyone who serves the king with devotion is bound to earn his favour in the long run.\u00a0 The one who does not remains where he is. Those who understand why the king is angry or generous, will one day rise in the office. It is necessary to be in the good books of the king.' <br \/><br \/>\u201cOkay, what do you want to do now?\u201d asked Karataka. <br \/><br \/>\u201cYou know the king is scared now. We will ask him what frightens him and using the six ways of diplomacy get close to him.\u201d <br \/><br \/>\u201cHow do you know the king is scared?\u201d <br \/><br \/>\u201cChanges in posture, signs, pace, actions, conversation, looks and expression indicate the working of the mind. I will approach the fear-struck king today and with my intelligence, I will dispel his fear and once again become his minister,\u201d said Damanaka. <br \/><br \/>\u201cHow can you do it when you do not know principles of service?\u201d asked Karataka. <br \/><br \/>Damanaka told him all he knew and learnt about what makes a good and loyal servant in the service of the king. <br \/><br \/>\u201cIn that case, I wish you all good luck,\u201d said Karataka. <br \/><br \/>Taking leave of Karataka, Damanaka then called on the king. Recognizing that he was the son of his old minister, King Pingalaka told his sentry to bring him into his presence. Damanaka came down on his knees to pay respects to the king. <br \/><br \/>\u201cWe haven't seen you for a long time,\u201d the king said. <br \/><br \/>\u201cI don't know what use I can be to you, my lord. Yet, <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>according to the learned, there are occasions when every person however high or low will be of use to the king.<\/strong><\/span> For generations we have served the king with devotion.

Go ahead and tell me whatever you have in your mind,\u201d the king ordered Damanaka.<br \/><br \/>\u201cMay I ask you humbly, my lord, what made you come back from the lake without drinking water,\u201d asked Damanaka reluctantly. <br \/><br \/>\u201cO' Damanaka, haven't you heard the great and frightening sounds in the distance? I want to leave this forest.\u00a0 The strange animal that could make such sounds ought to be as powerful as the sounds he makes.\u201d <br \/><br \/>\u201cYour majesty, if it is only sound that is your problem; I wish to submit that sounds are misleading. I can tell you the story of the jackal, how it overcame the fear of sound.\u201d <br \/><br \/>Let us hear it, said the king.<\/p>"},"settings":null,"created_at":"2023-08-20 08:22:13","updated_at":"2023-08-30 02:57:17"},{"position":"6","owner_id":"220815454","attribute":"value","value":{"story":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">1.2.\u00a0 The Jackle and the Drum<\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<p>A hungry jackal set out in search of food and ended up at an abandoned battlefield whence he heard loud and strange sounds. Scared, he thought, \u201cI must disappear from here before the man who is making these sounds gets me.\u201d\u00a0 After a while he told himself, \u201cI must not run away like that. Let me find out what really the sounds are and who is making them because whether it is fear or happiness one must know its cause. Such a person will never regret his actions. So, let me first look for the source of these noises.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Warily, the jackal marched in the direction of the sounds and found a drum there. It was this drum, which was sending the sounds whenever the branches of the tree above brushed against it. Relieved, the jackal began playing the drum and thought that there could be food inside it. The jackal entered the drum by piercing its side. He was disappointed to find no food in it. Yet he consoled himself saying that he rid himself of the fear of sound.<br \/><br \/>\u201cTherefore\u201d, Damanaka told king Pingalaka, \u201cyour majesty should not be afraid of sounds. I seek your permission to go and see what the sounds are.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cOkay,\u201d said the king. Taking leave of the king, Damanaka proceeded in the direction of the sound.<br \/><br \/>The king now began worrying himself about Damanaka's intentions. \u201cHe may have a grudge against me for dismissing him once. Such persons seek revenge. I should not have taken him into confidence. Let me keep an eye on him. <strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Wise men have always maintained that it is difficult to kill even a weak man who does not easily trust others but easy to kill a strong man who readily trusts others<\/span>,\u201d<\/strong> the king thought.<br \/><br \/>As the king kept an eye on him, Damanaka moved slowly towards Sanjeevaka, the bullock, and found that he was after all an animal and thought, \u201cThis is a good omen. This will help me to get back into the good books of the king. Kings never follow the advice of their ministers unless they are in peril or grief. Just as a healthy man never thinks of a doctor, a strong and secure king also never remembers the need for a minister.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Assured that what he saw was only a bullock, Damanaka returned to the king and told him what he saw.<br \/><br \/>\u201cIs it true?\u201d the king asked.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThe king is God. The man who lies to a king perishes. He alone has the power to grant favors.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cI believe you. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Great men do not harm weaker people.<\/strong><\/span>\u00a0 They take on only their equals. That is what is unique about brave people.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat your majesty says is true. Sanjeevaka is great. If your lordship permits me, I will persuade him to be one of your servants.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cAll right, I am taking you back as a minister,\u201d said the king, pleased.<br \/><br \/>Damanaka at once hurried back to Sanjeevaka and told him to stop bellowing and come and meet his king.<br \/><br \/>But the bullock wanted who this Pingalaka was. \u201cWhat? You do not know our lord? Wait, you will know shortly the cost of this ignorance. There he is, surrounded by his retinue under the banyan tree.\u201d Sanjeevaka thought his days were numbered and pleaded with Damanaka, \u201cSir, you seem to be a man of great wisdom and wit. You alone can save me. I can come only if you can assure me that no harm will come to me.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Damanaka told the bullock to wait for the right time to meet the king.<br \/><br \/>Returning to the king, Damanaka told him \u201cMy lord, he is not an ordinary being. He is the vehicle of Lord Shiva. He told me that Lord Shiva had permitted him to feed on the tender grass in the neighborhood of Jamuna. But I told him that the forest belonged to \"our lion king who is the vehicle of goddess Chandika. You are our guest. You can see our king and seek a separate space for you to graze.\" He agreed to this plan provided he has an assurance from your majesty.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cYes, certainly.

He held a great reception for his wedding attended by the king, the queen, their ministers and all the rich and influential persons in the city.<br \/><br \/>Present at the reception was Gorambha, a lowly sweeper in the royal household. When Dantila saw him occupying a seat reserved for the nobles of the king, he ordered his servants to throw him out of his house.<br \/><br \/>Thus insulted, Gorambha thought to himself, \u201cI am a poor man and so cannot give a fitting reply to such a wealthy person as Dantila. I must some how see that the king stops his favours to him.\u201d Then he hit upon a plan to take revenge on Dantila.<br \/><br \/>One early morning when the king was still in sleep, Gorambha pretending to sweep the king's bedroom began loudly murmuring, \u201cOh, how arrogant is Dantila! He has the cheek to lock the queen in his embrace.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Hearing this, the king demanded to know whether what Gorambh was murmuring is true. Did Dantila embrace the queen?<br \/><br \/>\u201cOh, your majesty, I don't remember nor do I know what I was saying because I was drowsy having spent the entire night in gambling,\u201d the sweeper told the king.<br \/><br \/>Not satisfied with his reply the king thought that it was possible that the sweeper had seen Dantila, who had equal access to the royal household as Gorambha, embracing the queen. He remembered wise men saying that men were likely to talk in their sleep about what they did, saw and desired in the day. Women were chaste because men were not within reach or they were afraid of prying servants. Convinced that Dantila had indeed embraced the queen, the king barred Dantila from entering the royal household.<br \/><br \/>The merchant began grieving his fate though he had not done any harm to the king or his relatives even in his dreams. One day as Dantila was trying to enter the king's palace he was barred by the king's men. Seeing this Gorambha told them, \u201cYou fools, you are barring the great Dantila who has won the king's favours. He is powerful. If you stop him, you will meet with the same fate as I did at the hands of Dantila one day.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The merchant thought that it would do him good to make Gorambha happy and win his confidence. One evening he invited the sweeper for tea and presented him with expensive clothes and told him, \u201cFriend, I had never meant to insult you. You had occupied a seat I had set apart for the learned. Kindly pardon me.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Pleased, the sweeper promised to win the king's favour for Dantila again. The next day, Gorambha repeated the same drama of pretending to talk irrelevantly, raving that the king was eating cucumber in the rest room.<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking? Did you ever see me doing such things?\u201d the king demanded to know. \u201cNo, your majesty. I do not know nor do I remember what I was saying because I was drowsy having spent the entire night in gambling,\u201d the sweeper said.<br \/><br \/>The king then realized that if what the sweeper had said about him was not true what he had said about Dantila also could not be true. A person like Dantila could not have done what Gorambha had told him. The king also found that without Dantila the affairs of the state had suffered and civic administration had come to a standstill. The king immediately summoned the merchant to his palace and restored to him all the authority he had enjoyed before he fell out of king's favour.<br \/><br \/>Damanaka resumed, \u201cThat is why we must know that pride goes before fall.\u201d Sanjeevaka agreed. Taking him to the lion king, Damanaka introduced Sanjeevaka to Pingalaka. After exchanging pleasantries, the king asked him to relate his past and the purpose of staying in that jungle. On the bullock relating his story, the king said, \u201cFriend, don't be afraid. I assure you that I will protect you from wild animals here because even stronger animals feel insecure here.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Since then, the king asked Karataka and Damanaka to look after the affairs of the state and began happily spending his time in the company of Sanjeevaka. But the jackals were worried that after Sanjeevaka had become a good friend of the king, the king gave up his royal sports and pastime and became a saint.<br \/><br \/>The jackal twins thought, \u201cthe king has stopped taking us into confidence after Sanjeevaka became his best friend. He is also indifferent to his kingly duties. What shall we do now?\u201d<br \/><br \/>Karataka said, \u201cThe king may not heed our advice. But it is our duty to advise him on it if it is good for him.<br \/><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Elders have always held that even if the king is not willing to heed good advice, it is the duty of his ministers to offer him advice<\/strong><\/span>. \u201cYou are right,\u201d said Damanaka. \u201cThe mistake is mine.

He amassed a lot of wealth by selling clothes gifted to him by well-wishers and disciples. It became a burden for him to guard that wealth. Since he did not trust anyone, he put all his money into a bag and carried it with him wherever he went. Ashadhabhooti, an experienced cheat, noticed Deva Sarma carrying his bag always with him and assuming that it certainly contained something valuable, began planning to snatch it from him.<br \/><br \/>One day, the cheat met the saint and promptly fell on his feet and said, \u201cOh, know-all, I have realized that this life is an illusion; youth is fleeting and all familial ties are like a dream. Please show me the correct path that delivers me from all worldly ties.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Pleased with his humility, Deva Sarma said, \u201cChild, you are the blessed one who has thought of renouncing worldly pleasures. Listen, however low his caste is, the person that chants \u201cOm Namahsivayah' and smears holy ash on his forehead, becomes Siva himself and knows no rebirth. I shall accept you as my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 but you must not enter the hermitage in the night because company is forbidden for saints. After initiation, you have to live in the hut at the entrance of the monastery.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Ashadhabhooti promised the saint that he would consider every sign from him as a command and carry it out.<br \/><br \/>Satisfied, the saint accepted the cheat as his disciple. Ashadhabhooti too began making Deva Sarma happy by attending to every need of his. But seeing that the saint never separated the money-bag from his person, Ashadhabhooti thought, \u201cthe old man is very crafty and keeps the bag always with him. How can I snatch it from him? Shall I kill him?\u201d<br \/><br \/>As the cheat was at a loss to achieve his goal, the son of a disciple came calling on the sage. The visitor invited Deva Sarma to come to his village and perform the sacred thread ceremony of his son. The saint accepted the invitation and set out for the village taking Ashadhabhooti with him.<br \/><br \/>On the way, the guru and his disciple had to cross a river. After bathing in the river and wanting to rest for a while, Deva Sarma took the money bag and pushed it into a quilt he was carrying and told the disciple, \u201cI have to respond to nature\u2019s call. I am leaving this holy quilt of Siva here. Keep an eye on it.\u201d The moment the guru went out of his sight, Ashadhabhooti collected the bag and fled the place.<br \/><br \/>With great trust in his disciple, Deva Sarma decided to spend time by joining a crowd watching two well-fed goats fighting ferociously. As blood was running down their heads, a jackal came there to feast on the blood the two goats were shedding. Deva Sarma saw the jackal entering the scene and thought that the jackal would surely die caught between the two warring goats. His surmise came true and the jackal died, gored by the two goats.<br \/><br \/>Brooding over the demise of the jackal, Deva Sarma returned to where he had left the money-bag with Ashadhabhooti and panicked when he found Ashadhabhooti missing. The holy quilt was there but not the money-bag in it. He began wailing, \u201cOh, trickster, what have you done? I have lost everything in this world.\u201d<br \/><br \/>After a vain search for the trickster, the foolish saint returned home dejected.<br \/><br \/>Damanaka asked Karataka, \u201cWhat do you learn from this episode?\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cYou alone can tell me.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cThe sage and the jackal <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>have none to blame except themselves.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cIn a similar situation, what should we do?\u201d<br \/><br \/>Damanaka said, \u201cYes, I know what to do now.

Because of age, it was not able to prey on fish and other insects. Unable to suffer hunger, the crane stood on the edge of the lake and began crying pitiably. Moved at the sight, a crab passing by asked the crane:<br \/><br \/>\u201cFriend, what is the matter? Why are you not hunting for food today?\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cSon, you have correctly guessed. I am feeling guilty because I have swallowed too many fish. I have decided to fast unto death and am not harming even the fish that are within my reach,\u201d said the crane.<br \/><br \/>\u201cBut why are you so philosophical today,\u201d asked the crab.<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat shall I tell you? I have heard that there will be no rains for the coming twelve years. Astrologers have forecast an evil conjunction of the planets. As a result, there won't be rains on this earth for another twelve years. All these years we have all played and lived together. I am now worried about the fate waiting for these poor fish and other creatures in the lake. They will die and I will be alone and without them.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cIs there no way we can save ourselves?\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cAt present, fish and other water creatures in other lakes are migrating to bigger lakes with the help of their relatives. Here, nobody seems to worry about the dark future. At this rate, there won't be any kind of fish left.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The crab carried this information to all the fish and other water creatures in the lake. Alarmed, all of them came to the crane and pleaded with him to show them the way to overcome this danger.<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhy not. There is a big lake not far from here that has plenty of water throughout the year and lotuses always in bloom. That lake does not go dry even if there are no rains for twenty-four years. I can ferry all of you one by one to that lake.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The poor fish and other water creatures at once put all the trust in the crane and agreed to be ferried. Every day, the crane would take one of them at a time to a lonely place, smash them against a stone and eat them.<br \/><br \/>He would return to the lake and repeat the trick every day. One day the crab asked the crane, \u201cUncle, you are taking everyone to the faraway lake and not me. Why don't you take me there today and save my life?\u201d<br \/><br \/>Tired with eating fish every day, the crane too was happy to carry the crab to the lake that did not exist. The crab was happy and mounted on the back of the crane. As the crane was flying close to the spot where he ate all the fish, the crab saw a heap of fish bones and asked the crane, \u201cUncle, we have come a long distance and I see no lake anywhere. Tell me, where is the lake?\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>You are a fool to trust me<\/strong><\/span>. There is no lake. Nor is there water. Say your prayers now; I am going to kill you.\u201d The crafty crab at once caught the neck of the crane in his claws and tore through it to death. Slowly, carrying the crane's neck, the crab reached the lake where all his friends, worried that the crane did not come back, asked him what made him come back.<br \/><br \/>The crab said, \u201cyou fools, that crane was taking all of us to a lonely place where it would smash the victims against a rock and have them for lunch. I found out his mischief and saved myself by slicing his neck. From today, all of us can live happily without fear.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Then the crows asked the jackal how they could get rid of the cobra that was feasting on their offspring. The jackal told them to go to a big city and snatch any item of jewellery from a palace and drop it in the hollow of the tree that is the cobra's home. In search of the jewellery, the king's men would reach the tree and kill the cobra.<br \/><br \/>The crow couple flew off to a lake where the women in the king's harem were revealing in water. Before entering water, the women left their jewellery and clothes on the waterside. The female crow skillfully dived and snatched a gold necklace and began slowly flying towards the cobra's hideout. The king's men who saw the crow fly off with the necklace followed the female crow and saw it dropping the necklace into the hollow of the tree. They ran to the tree and pulling it out killed the cobra.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThat's why,\u201d Damanaka told Karataka, \u201celders say that <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>he who is wise is stronger than the strong.<\/strong><\/span> That is how a small hare killed the almighty lion.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cHow is that?\u201d asked Karataka.<br \/><br \/>\"That is another story,\u201d said Damanaka.<\/p>"},"settings":null,"created_at":"2023-08-20 08:22:17","updated_at":"2023-08-20 15:15:01"},{"position":"10","owner_id":"220815454","attribute":"value","value":{"story":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">1.6.\u00a0 The Cunning Hare and The Witless Lion<\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<p>Bhasuraka was a lion lording over the jungle, killing deer, boars, rabbits, bisons, etc. Yet he was not happy with his kill. The victims too were unhappy and met the lion one day in a delegation. \u201cOh, lord,\u201d they said, \u201cwhy do you kill so many animals every day when you need only one for your food? Let us come to an understanding. From today, you need not move from your place. We will send an animal every day to you.<br \/><br \/>That will spare you the trouble of hunting and us our lives.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cOur forebears have said that the duty of the king is to rule and not to destroy. Just as a seed sprouts, grows into a tree and yields fruit, a people protected by the king come to his rescue in times of need.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat you say is true,\u201d the lion said and added a condition. \u201cIf you fail to send one animal every day, I shall kill all of you.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cAgreed,\u201d said the animals and began roaming the forest without fear and sending one of their own folk to the lion for his lunch. One day it was the turn of a hare. He started leisurely on his last journey and saw a big well on the way and saw his own reflection when he peeped into the well from curiosity.<br \/><br \/>Suddenly an idea struck the hare. \u201cI will somehow tempt the lion to the well and persuade him to jump into it,\u201d the hare thought to himself. It was late in the evening when the hare reached the lion's den. The lion was hungry and so angry and decided to kill all the animals when the hare came and knelt before him.<br \/><br \/>\u201cFirst, you are too small for my lunch. Second, you have come late. I shall kill you and all the others too,\u201d the lion warned the hare.<br \/><br \/>\u201cMy lord, it is not my fault or the fault of other animals.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cLet me know who it is who delayed you and I will kill him at once.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cOur folks have decided that it is my turn today. Since I do not make a full meal, they have sent three more hares with me for your meal. As we were all coming to you, a big lion came out of his den and demanded to know where we were all going.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cWe are all going to Bhasuraka as his meal according to our arrangement, we said. The big lion said that this jungle belonged to him and that all animals obeyed its orders. He also told us that you are a cheat and asked us to bring you to him for a trial of strength. Whoever is the victor will become the king. He commanded me to summon you to his fort. That's why I am late. It is now for you to decide,\u201d the hare told the lion.<br \/><br \/>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Bhasuraka told the hare, \u201cshow me that lion. I will kill him and have him for lunch.

Thrilled by the sound of his own ilk,Kakudruma began loudly responding in his natural voice. The lions and other animals immediately recognized that their king was after all a jackal and not a Godsend. They at once pounced on the blue jackal and killed him.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThe moral is,\u201d Damanaka said, \u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>he who abandons his own folk will perish.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cBut how do I believe that Sanjeevaka has evil intentions,\u201d asked Pingalaka.<br \/><br \/>\u201cHe told me today that he would kill you tomorrow.

If what I say comes true, it is for you what to do with Pingalaka,\u201d said Damanaka.<br \/><br \/>After this meeting with the lion king, Damanaka went to meet Pingalaka.

Somebody has rightly compared service to a dog's life,\u201d said Damanaka.<br \/><br \/>\u201cCome to the point, my friend\u201d The bullock was now impatient.<br \/><br \/>Damanaka said, \u201cSir, <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>a minister is not supposed to give bad advice.

Pingalaka has evil designs against you.<br \/><br \/>When we were alone, he told me he would kill you and bring happiness to everyone in the palace.<br \/><br \/>\u201cI told the king that this was stabbing a friend in the back,\u201d Damanaka continued. \u201cThe king was angry and said that you were a vegetarian and he lived on a diet of meat and so there was natural discord between you and him. He said that this was enough reason for him to kill you. This is a secret I have kept to myself for a long time.

Recovering after some time, he said, \u201cIt is truly said that a person who serves the king is like a bullock without horns. It is difficult to know the mind of a king who has different ideas. It is not easy to serve a king. Even sages could not read the minds of kings.

One day they sighted Kradanaka, a camel who lost his way. Thinking the camel they saw was an unusual animal, the lion asked his assistants to find out if he was a wild animal or domestic animal.<br \/><br \/>The crow said that the camel was a domestic animal fit to be killed and eaten. Refusing to eat Kradanaka, the lion said:\u00a0 \u201cI shall not kill someone who came seeking hospitality. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>According to our elders, you cannot kill even an enemy who came trusting you. He who kills so commits the sin of killing hundred Brahmins.<\/strong><\/span> Assure him of safety and bring him to me.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The three assistants brought the camel to the presence of the lion. On the lion asking the camel to relate his story, Kradanaka told him how he was part of a trade caravan and how he had lost his way. The lion told the camel, \u201cKradanaka, why do you go back to your village and become once again a beast of burden? Remain with us without any hesitation and feast on this tender grass.\u201d Thereafter, the camel stayed on to live happily with the lion and his three assistants.<br \/><br \/>One day, the lion was locked in a battle with an elephant. The tusker gored Madotkata and badly injured him.<br \/><br \/>He became too weak to hunt. Without food he was in no position to do anything. Then, the lion asked the assistants to go out and look for some animal for his meal. \"Bring the animal here. I will kill him somehow and provide food for you all,\u201d said the lion.<br \/><br \/>The leopard, the jackal, and the camel looked everywhere for an animal but could not find anyone. The jackal told the crow aside:<br \/><br \/>\u201cFriend, what is the use of wasting time like this? We have Kradanaka, our lord's loyal friend. Let us kill him and survive.\u201d \u201cThat is fine. Yet we cannot kill him because our lord has assured him protection,\u201d said the crow.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cLeave it to me. I shall convince Madotkata to kill the camel. Wait here. I will meet the lord and get his permission,\u201d said the jackal and left to meet the lion.<br \/><br \/>The jackal told his lord, \u201cOh, lord, we went to every nook and corner of the forest. We could not find a single animal. We are tired, weak and hungry. Since my lord is also in the same condition, I humbly suggest that we make a meal of this camel.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Highly annoyed, the lion said, \u201cYou sinner, if you repeat these words, I shall first kill you. I have given him my word. How can I kill him? <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Haven't our elders said that no gift of land or cow or food is greater than the gift of an assurance?<\/strong><\/span>\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cYou are right my lord. It is a sin to kill him who has your word. But if the camel voluntarily offers himself as food it is no sin to accept the offer. If he does not volunteer, you can kill anyone of us. You are hungry and close to your end. If we are not of use to you at this time what value have our lives? If anything undesirable happens to our lord, we will immolate ourselves.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cThis seems to be more reasonable,\u201d said the lion.<br \/><br \/>The jackal told the other two assistants, \u201cFriends, our lord is in a pitiable condition. There is now no one to protect us from others. Instead of aimlessly searching the forest for food, let us offer our bodies to him. That will deliver us from the burden of debt. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The servant who is witness to the helpless death of his master will go to hell.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d<br \/><br \/>After the jackal's plea, all of them called on the lion with tears in their eyes. \u201cWhat's the matter? Did you find an animal?\u201d asked the lion.<br \/><br \/>\u201cNo, my lord. We searched every place, every inch of the forest. We are not lucky. We found nothing. But I request the lord to have me for his meal. That will mean two birds with one shot. The lord will survive and I will go to heaven. He who lays down his life to save his lord will have no rebirth,\u201d said the crow.<br \/><br \/>It was now the turn of the jackal to show his loyalty. He said, \u201cMy friend, crow. Your body is too small to slake the hunger of my lord. It amounts to starving him and that is a sin. Get out of my way. I have to submit a plea to my lord.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Addressing the lion, the jackal said, \u201cLord, I request you to have me for your meal and ensure me a place in heaven. The lord has rights of life and death over his servants. Therefore, it is no sin in exercising his rights.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The leopard intervened and said, \u201cYou jackal, you are no great personality. Let me plead with the lord.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Addressing Madotkata, the leopard said, \u201cOh lord, let me give away my life to save your life. Please permit me to earn a permanent berth in heaven. My sacrifice will win fame for me on earth.\u201d<br \/><br \/>All this set Kradanaka thinking, \u201cAll these servants of the lord have said what they wanted to say. Still, the lion did not kill anyone of them. Let me also offer to be the lord's food today. I am sure my friends will support me.' He then turned to the leopard and said, \u201cWhat you have said is right and proper. But you are a carnivorous animal and belong to the same species as the master does. How can he kill you? Let me offer myself.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The camel then came forward and requested the lion to have him for that day's meal. At once, the jackal and the leopard pounced on him tore him to pieces and all of them had a sumptuous feast.<br \/><br \/>As the story ended Sanjeevaka told Damanaka, \u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Wicked people surround the king<\/strong>.<\/span> Good men should not serve such masters.

Will anyone be brash enough to challenge Yama (the Lord of Death) to take his life if he can? You can lay your eggs here only.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Listening to this dialogue, the Sea thought, \u201cHow vain is this bird which is as small as a worm! Let me drown these eggs and see what he can do.\u201d<br \/><br \/>After laying eggs, the female bird went in search of food. In her absence, the Sea sent a wave that sucked the eggs into the waters.

He had two friends, a jackal named Chaturaka and a wolf named Kravyamukha. Because of their friendship with the lion, the jackal and the wolf had a free run of the forest.<br \/><br \/>One day the lion found a female camel separated from its caravan and in labour pains. The lion killed the camel and found a live baby camel inside her womb. The lion and his friends fed on the dead camel but spared the baby. The lion adopted the baby and brought him home.<br \/><br \/>The lion told the baby camel, \u201cYou are now my child. Nobody can harm you. You can freely roam about the forest and have a nice time. You have ears which look like a pair of conches. So I will call you Sankhukarna.\u201d<br \/><br \/>As days passed, Sankhukarna became a young and energetic animal. He was always to be seen in the company of Vajradanstra. One day the lion had to confront a wild elephant and in the fight the elephant badly injured the lion. Now the lion was too weak to go out and hunt. He called his friends, the jackal and the wolf, and the camel and told them, \u201cLook for an animal. I will kill it and all of us can have a good meal.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The three scoured the entire forest but could not find an animal. In despair, the jackal thought, \u201cIf we can kill this camel we will have a sure meal for several days. But he is a favorite of our king. He will not agree to kill the camel. Yet with my cunning I will see that the lion kills him. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The learned have said there is nothing impossible or forbidden for an intelligent being.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d<br \/><br \/>The jackal told the camel, \u201cO Sankhukarna, our lord has been without food for a long time and he may die of hunger. His death will mean a disaster for all of us. I have a plan to get over this problem. Listen.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cGo ahead. Let me know what you have in mind. I shall certainly do whatever I can for the lord because <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>if we do good to our master we will reap a reward hundred times more valuable than what we gave to the master<\/strong><\/span>,\u201d said the camel.<br \/><br \/>Chaturaka, the jackal said, \u201cO young camel, offer your body to the lord at the double the profit. Your body also will grow in size and the lord also will continue to live.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The camel replied, \u201cI am ready. Let the lord know that he can have my body provided the Lord of Duty is a witness to my sacrifice.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The jackal, the wolf and the camel then called on the lion to inform him of the camel's decision. The jackal told the lion, \u201cWe searched the entire forest without sighting even a small animal. It is already sunset now.\u00a0 The camel is prepared to offer his body if you are ready to increase the size of his body and invite the Lord of Duty to be a witness.\u201d<br \/><br \/>On the lion agreeing to the proposal, the jackal and the wolf at once pounced on the camel and tore him to pieces.<br \/><br \/>Vajradanstra, the lion, told the jackal, \u201cI am going to the river to take a bath and worship the deities. Till I come back, keep an eye on this food.' The minute the lion left the scene, the jackal thought of a plan to have the camel all to himself. He told Kravyamukha, the wolf, \u201cYou seem to be very hungry. Go ahead and feast on the camel meat. When the lion comes I shall convince him about your innocence.\u201d<br \/><br \/>As the wolf started to taste the meat, the jackal alerted him and told him that the lord was coming and to allay any suspicion he should stop eating and leave the place. When the lion came, he saw that the heart of the camel was missing. Angrily, the lion roared and said, \u201cWho is the culprit, I will kill him.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The wolf then looked at the jackal suggesting that the jackal should convince the lion of his innocence. But the cunning jackal said, \u201cYou did not heed my warning and ate the meat. Why do you now expect me to help you?' Realizing the danger, the wolf fled the scene to save his life.<br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, a caravan of camels passing by stopped where the lion and the jackal were planning the next move. The lead camel had a big bell tied to his neck. Frightened by the sound of the bell, the lion asked the jackal to find out what the sound was all about. He had not heard such sounds in his life. Pretending to find out, the jackal went out of the lion's sight and shouted from there, \u201cO lord, run for your life.\"<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat's the matter,\u201d the lion asked him. \u201cWhy are you frightening me? Let me know clearly what's happening.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The jackal said, \u201cMy lord, the Lord of Death is angry that you have killed the camel before its death was due.\u00a0 He is upset and vowed that he would get from you one thousand times more than the value of the camel we have killed. It is the Lord of Death who hung a bell in the lead camel's neck. He also brought with him all the ancestors of the camel.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The jackal thus tricked the lion into hurriedly fleeing the place, leaving the camel's body all to himself to feast upon.<br \/><br \/>Damanaka continued, \u201cThat is why I told you that <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>a wise man protects his interest even if it is to torment others and never shares his secrets with others<\/strong><\/span> as Chaturaka, the jackal did in the above story.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Sanjeevaka began pondering, \u201cWhy did I do like this.

The lion also was surprised at the bullock's arrogance and, believing what Damanaka had told him about Sanjeevaka, pounced on him tearing him with his claws. Sanjeevaka too began goring the lion with his horns.<br \/><br \/>Seeing that the jackal and the lion were determined to fight to the end, Karataka admonished Damanaka,<br \/><br \/>\u201cYou fool!

One day, Papa thought, \u201cI am a man without worldly wisdom and added to that I am also poor. Let me persuade Dharma to take me to far off lands and earn lots of money through his business skills. Later I will deprive him of all his wealth and live happily ever after.\u201d<br \/><br \/>With these plans on his mind, Papa told Dharma, \u201cMy friend, you are growing old and cannot manage your business.

We shall bury most of our money in some secret place in this forest. Whenever we need money, we can come here and take whatever we need. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>You know that money tempts even saints.\u201d<\/strong><\/span><br \/><br \/>Dharma agreed to Papa's plan and went home after both of them dug a pit and covered it after burying most of their earnings in it. One midnight Papa went to the secret place in the forest and stole all the money and brought it home. Next morning, he went to Dharma and suggested that they should go to the forest because he was in need of money.<br \/><br \/>When both of them arrived at the secret spot in the forest and dug there, they found the pit empty. At once Papa began shouting loudly, \u201cDharma, you stole the money and nobody else. The pit was carefully covered. You must give me half of what we have buried here.' Though Dharma denied it, Papa insisted that they should take the dispute to a court of law.<br \/><br \/>When the case came before the court, the judge asked them to take oath in the name of God. But Papa quoted experts as saying that relevant documents should be produced first as proof, then witnesses would be summoned to give evidence and <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>oath in the name of God is taken when neither documents nor witnesses are available<\/strong>.<\/span><br \/><br \/>\"I can produce the gods of the forest as witnesses. They will determine who is guilty and who is innocent,\u201d said Papa. Impressed by this plan, the judges asked both the parties to be present next morning at the forest for a hearing. Happy at the judges' order, Papa went home and told his father, \u201cFather, I have stolen all Dharma's money. There is a case in the court that I can win only with your help. Otherwise, my life will be in danger.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat have I to do to get that money, son,\u201d asked his father.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThere is a big tree there.

Then it is your turn to declare that Dharma is the thief,\u201d said the son.<br \/><br \/>The father left at once for the forest to hide in the hollow of the tree. The morning of the next day, the son took a bath and went to the tree taking Dharma and the judges with him. Papa went near the tree and shouted, \u201cO sun, moon, air, fire, earth, water, the God of Death, day and night, you are all witnesses to the history of humanity. O Goddess of the Forest, declare who among us is guilty.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The father shouted back from inside the hollow of the tree, \u201cListen all of you, it is Dharma who stole the money.\u201d The judges and the king's men heard the verdict and sat down to decide what punishment they should give Dharma.

Karataka told him the following story.<br \/><br \/>Jeernadhana was the son of a rich merchant. But he had lost all his wealth. He thought he should go abroad, for, he told himself that he who had once prospered should not live in the same place as a poor man. People who respected him once would now look down upon him and shun him. Deciding to go abroad to seek his fortune, he mortgaged with a local merchant the 1000-pound balance his ancestors had left behind.<br \/><br \/>He went abroad with the money the merchant gave him and after several years came home and asked the merchant to return him the balance.<br \/><br \/>The merchant said, \u201cO my, where is the balance? The rats have gnawed at it for food.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Jeernadhana replied without emotion, \u201cI cannot blame you for what the rats have done. The world is like that. Nothing really is permanent. Any way, I am going to the river to take the purificatory bath. Please send with me your son Dhanadeva to look after my needs.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Afraid that Jeernadeva would accuse him of theft, the merchant called his son and told him, \u201cSon, your uncle is going to the river for a bath.

After taking bath, he led the boy into a nearby cave and, pushing the boy inside, closed it with a huge boulder.

He went on to relate a second story to show how shrewd people save the lives of others.<br \/><br \/>Once upon a time a Brahmin lived in a big city and as a result of his misdeeds in his previous birth he became a thief. He saw four other Brahmins from another city selling a variety of goods in his city. He thought he should somehow deprive the four Brahmins of their money and through sweet words become their good friend. He was useful to them in whatever way he could. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>True, it comes naturally for women of vice to act coy and for charlatans to pretend to be learned<\/strong>.<\/span> The four visitors sold all their goods and with the money from the sales bought pearls and precious jewels.<br \/><br \/>The Brahmin thief was keeping an eye on what they were doing even as he pretended to serve them faithfully. One day, in the presence of the Brahmin, the traders cut open their thighs and storing the jewels and pearls inside the thighs sewed them back.<br \/><br \/>The Brahmin was disappointed that they did not give him even a small part of their wealth. He immediately decided to follow them and kill them in the middle of their journey back home and take all that wealth from them.<br \/><br \/>He told the traders with tears in his eyes, \u201cFriends, you seem to be ready to leave me behind. My heart is broken because it is difficult for me to snap the bonds of friendship with you. If you will be so kind as to take me with you, I will be very grateful to you.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Moved by his request, the traders started their homeward journey accompanied by the Brahmin thief. They passed through several villages, towns and cities before they reached a village inhabited by thugs. Suddenly, they heard a group of crows loudly shouting, \u201cYou thugs, very rich people are coming. Come, kill them and become rich.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The thugs at once attacked the Brahmin traders with sticks and began examining their bags. But they found nothing. They were surprised because this was the first time that the words of the crows turned out to be false. They told the traders, \u201cO traders, the crows always tell the truth. You have the money with you somewhere. Take it out or we will cut every limb of yours and bring it out.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The Brahmin thief pondered, \u201cThese thugs will certainly pierce the body of the traders to grab the jewels. My turn also will come. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>It is better I offer myself to these thugs and save the lives of the Brahmins.<\/strong> <strong>There is no point in fearing death because it will come today or after hundred years.

The thugs accepted the offer and found nothing on him after they pierced his body. They let go the other four Brahmins thinking that they also did not have anything precious on their bodies.<br \/><br \/>As Karataka and Damanaka were discussing the ways of the world, Sanjeevaka engaged Pingalaka in a short battle in which Pingalaka clawed him to death. But the lion was immediately struck by remorse and, recalling the good days he had spent with the bullock, began repenting:<br \/><br \/>\u201cO I have committed a great sin by killing my friend. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>There cannot be a greater sin than killing a trusted friend. They who forget a favour or breach a trust or let down a friend will all go to hell as long as the sun and the moon shine in the sky.<\/strong> <strong>A king will perish whether what he loses is his kingdom or a faithful servant.\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>A servant and a kingdom are not the same because you can always win back the kingdom but not a trusted servant.<\/strong><\/span> In the court, I have always praised Pingalaka. How can I explain his death to the courtiers?\u201d<br \/><br \/>Damanaka approached the grief-stricken king and told him, \u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>O lord, ruing the death of a grass eater is cowardice. It is not good for a king like you. The learned have always said that it is not a sin to kill a person for treason even if that person is a father, brother, son, wife or a friend. Similarly, one must abandon a tender-hearted king, a Brahmin who eats all kinds of food, an immodest woman, a wicked assistant, a disobedient servant and an ungrateful person.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d<br \/><br \/>Damanaka continued, \u201cYou are mourning the death of someone who does not deserve sympathy. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Though you are talking like a learned man, you forget that learned men do not think of the past or the dead.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d<br \/><br \/>These words of Damanaka worked like a tonic providing relief to Pingalaka\u2019s troubled mind.

There was a city called Mahilaropyam in the south not far off from where was a large banyan tree. Many species of birds came there to eat the tree\u2019s fruit. In the hollow of the great tree lived poisonous reptiles like snakes and scorpions. Travelers found the tree a great shelter in their journeys.<br \/><br \/>A crow called Laghupatanaka made this tree his home. As he was flying one day towards the city for collecting food, he sighted a hunter carrying a net and approaching the tree like a messenger of death. The crow at once sensed danger and, sure that the hunter came to trap the birds on the tree, told all the birds, \u201cFriends, this wicked hunter have seeds in his bag that he will scatter to lure you. don\u2019t trust him and avoid the seeds like poison.\u201d The hunter came, sowed the seeds and spread the net. He left the spot and sat elsewhere not to arouse the suspicion of the birds. Warned by Laghupatanaka, the birds stayed away from the seeds as though they were poisonous berries.<br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, Chitragriva, king of doves, saw the seeds from a distance and landed there with his retinue of one thousand doves. They came to eat the seeds ignoring the warnings of Laghupatanaka and soon the hunter spread his net and trapped all of them. That is why elders have said that <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>fools can never foresee peril. People often lose sense when danger lurks in the corner.<\/strong><\/span><br \/><br \/>Chitragriva and his retinue, however, kept their cool in the face of danger. He appealed to his friends not to panic. Elders have said that they tide over dangers, who are not scared by crisis. \u201cLet us fly together and land elsewhere where the hunter cannot reach us. We can then plan a strategy to get out of this net. If we don\u2019t fly now, we are all doomed,\u201d said Chitragriva. Thereupon, all of them flew together.<br \/><br \/>The hunter followed the flight of the doves and looking upwards chanted, \u201cThey are flying together. But the moment there is a break in their unity they will crash to the ground.\u201d Laghupatanaka, the crow, also followed the flying doves to see what they would do. When he lost sight of the birds, the hunter gave up and went home ruing that he had lost his net also.<br \/><br \/>When he was sure that the hunter had failed to chase them, the king of the doves told his friends, \u201cThe hunter has disappeared. Let us all now fly towards Mahilaropyam where I have a friend Hiranyaka, who is a rat. He is our only hope. It is only a friend who will come to the aid of those in trouble.\u201d The birds, heeding the advice of the king, flew to the fort of Hiranyaka in Mahilaropyam.<br \/><br \/>Standing outside the fort, Chitragriva shouted, \u201cO friend, come quickly. We are in great trouble.\u201d Without coming out, Hiranyaka shouted back, \u201cWho are you sir and what do you want from me? What is the kind of trouble that is bothering you? Let me know.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cI am your friend Chitragriva, king of the doves. Come out soon.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Hiranyaka came out and was happy to see Chitragriva with his retinue and asked what the matter was. The king of the doves said, \u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Whatever man does for whatever reasons, in whatever manner and wherever in his last birth. He reaps the consequences for the same reasons, in the same manner and in the same place.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAll of us are trapped in this net because of our weakness for food. Come at once and free us from this trap,\u201d urged Chitragriva.<br \/><br \/>Hiranyaka said, \u201cIt is rightly said that a bird can recognize food from fifty miles but cannot see the danger lurking next to him.\u201d<br \/><br \/>After delivering this sermon, the rat set out to free Chitragriva first. But the king of doves pleaded with him to first liberate his friends. The rat was angry and reminded Chitragriva that it was fair that the king became free first and then the servants. \u201cNo, it is not like that,\u201d countered Chitragriva. \u201cThey are all dedicated to my service and have left their families behind to come with me. I have to repay that debt,\u201d he said.<br \/><br \/>Pleased with his friend\u2019s love for his servants, Hiranyaka said, \u201cFriend, I know the duties of a king. I was only testing you. I will free everyone now. This will win more doves for your retinue.\u201d With the help of his servants, the rat then bit off the entire net and all the doves came out. Hiranyaka saw off Chitragriva and retinue and went back into his fort.<br \/><br \/>Seeing the whole drama of Hiranyaka liberating Chitragriva and his friends, Laghupatanaka, the crow, thought, \u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone. On top of it, I have a fickle mind. I will seek his friendship. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Our ancestors have always said that even if a wise man has everything he needs, he should still seek friends.<\/strong><\/span> Even if all the rivers flow into the Sea, the Sea still waits for the Moon to come out.\u201d<\/p>"},"settings":null,"created_at":"2023-08-20 08:22:30","updated_at":"2023-08-22 07:36:34"},{"position":"23","owner_id":"220815454","attribute":"value","value":{"story":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">2.1.\u00a0 The Crow-Rat discourse<\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<p>After he saw how Hiranyaka had helped Chitragriva, Lagupatanaka came down from his tree perch and called out the rat in a voice resembling that of Chitragriva.

Every day, he would go out into the city, collect alms and cook his food. After the meal, he would store whatever is left in his begging bowl and hang it to a peg and go to sleep. He would give the leftovers to poor people in return for services rendered to the temple.

But the hermit never stopped striking the bamboo.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cMeanwhile, a visitor named Brihat came calling on the hermit. Tamrachud received him with great respect and did whatever he could to make the honoured guest happy. At night, the guest would relate to the hermit tales about his travels. But Tamrachud, busy scaring the mice with his bamboo, would not pay much attention to what his guest was narrating. In the middle of the story, the guest would ask him questions to which he would give indifferent replies.<br \/><br \/>\u201cAngry with Tamrachud\u2019s absent mindedness, the visitor told him, \u201cTamrachud, you are not a great friend of mine because you are not attentive to what I am telling you.

The husband told his wife, \u201cToday is the time when the Sun begins his northward journey and a time when the rich and pious people offer gifts to Brahmins. I am going to the next village to receive the offerings. You will do well to invite a Brahmin as guest today and offer him food in the name of the Sun.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cThe wife flew into a rage and told him, \u201cHow can I offer anything to anyone in your poverty-stricken house? Aren\u2019t you ashamed to make such a suggestion? I have wasted my entire life as your wife. I haven\u2019t tasted a good meal so far even on a single day. Nor do I have any jewellery.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cThough taken aback, the Brahmin quickly recovered and said, \u201cSuch words are not becoming of you. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The learned say that if you share even half of your meal with a mendicant, you will get whatever you wish in life. <\/strong><\/span><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What good the rich reap by liberally giving away, the poor get by parting with even a cent they have.

The gut suddenly snapped with great force killing the jackal in the end. \u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d the Brahmin told his wife, \u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Haven\u2019t you heard that a man\u2019s longevity, destiny, wealth, learning and death are predetermined by God even as the child is in the womb of the mother.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cIf that is the case,\u201d Shandili said, \u201cI have some unhusked sesame seeds in the house.

The wife soaked the seeds in warm water, removed their husk and left them on a cloth to dry in the sun. As the Brahmin\u2019s wife was busy with other chores, a dog came and peed on the seeds left on the cloth to dry.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhen the wife saw what the dog had done, she felt miserable that all her effort had gone in vain. She thought that nobody could undo God\u2019s will. She thought, \u201cThese seeds cannot now be given away to anyone.<br \/><br \/>I will see if I can exchange them for unhusked seeds. Anybody will agree to this swap.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cBrihat continued his story, \u201cThe Brahmin\u2019s wife came to the same house which I was visiting to accept offerings. She offered to exchange the husked seeds to anyone ready to accept them. Then the woman in the house came out and was ready to accept the husked seeds from the Brahmin\u2019s wife. But her son intervened and told her, \u201cMother, these seeds are not good. Why should anyone give away good husked seeds for the raw seeds? There must be some reason for it.\u201d The housewife at once gave up the idea of taking husked seeds from the Brahmin\u2019s wife.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cAfter Brihat completed the story, he asked Tamrachud, \u201cDo you know the route he (Hiranyaka) takes to come here?\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d said Tamrachud.<br \/><br \/>\u201cHave you any tool to dig?\u201d asked the visitor.<br \/><br \/>\u201cYes, I have a dibble with me.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cIn that case, let us follow the mouse trail before it is erased,\u201d said the visitor.<br \/><br \/>Hiranyaka resumed his account and said, \u201cListening to the conversation between Tamrachud and Brihat, I thought that my end had come. Just as he had found my food store, he is capable of tracking my fort. <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Learned men can measure the strength of the rival by just looking at him.<\/strong><\/span> I decided immediately to take a new route and was on my way with the other mice when a fat cat sighted us. He immediately pounced on us and killed a number of my retinue.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cExcepting me, those of the bloodied mice who escaped being killed by the cat took the same old route to the fort. The visitor saw the trail of blood the fleeing mice left behind and following it reached my fort. There, Brihat and Tamrachud dug and found the food store. The visitor told Tamrachud, \u201cHere is the secret of the mouse\u2019s energy. Now, you can sleep in peace.\u201d Then they took the store to the temple, the home of Tamrachud.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cI went back to where I had stored food. It was now like a desert. Without food, the spot was a ghastly scene.<br \/><br \/>I did not know where to go and what to do to get back my peace of mind. Somehow, I spent the day in sorrow and when it was dawn went to the temple followed by what remained of my retinue. Alerted by the noise we made, Tamrachud again began striking the food bowl with the bamboo. Brihat, the visitor, asked him why he was doing so. Tamrachud told him about our return.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cThe visitor laughed and told Tamrachud, \u201cFriend, don\u2019t be afraid now. The mouse has lost his energy. It cannot do any mischief now.\u201d When I heard this, I was angry and tried again to jump at the food bowl and crashed to the ground before I could reach the bowl.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cI was dejected by this failure. But my sadness increased when I heard my retinue telling each other that I was no more capable of earning food for them and they should immediately give up serving me. I then realized the importance of riches and decided to somehow steal it back from Tamrachud. When I made another attempt, the visitor saw me and banged the bamboo on my head.

You have paid hundred rupees for a book that has only one verse. You can never come up in life. Leave my house at once. It has no place for you.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cThrown out of the house, the boy went to another city and began fresh life there. One day, a neighbor asked him, \u201cWhat is your native place and what is your name?\u201d<br \/><br \/>The boy replied, \u201cMan gets what he is destined to.\u201d He gave the same answer to whoever asked for his name.<br \/><br \/>From that day onwards, people began calling him Praptavya, meaning the same line he was reciting to indicate his name.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThe summer came and the city was celebrating it with a big fair. One of the visitors to the fair was the city\u2019s princess Chandravati and her maids. Chandravati was young and beautiful. As she was making the rounds of the fair, she saw an extremely handsome warrior and immediately fell in love with him. She told one of her maids, \u201cIt is your job to see that both of us meet.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The maid ran to the warrior and told him, \u201cI have a message for you from our princess. She says she will die if you do not meet her today.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cBut tell me where and how I can see her. How can I enter the harem?\u201d asked the warrior.<br \/><br \/>The maid told him, \u201cCome to the palace and you will see a rope hanging from the high wall. Climb and jump over the wall with the help of the rope.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cAll right, I will try to do it tonight,\u201d said the warrior.<br \/><br \/>When the night came, the warrior lost his nerve and thought, \u201cO this is an improper thing to do. The elders have said, \u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>He who has liaison with the daughter of a teacher, wife of a friend or of a master or of a servant commits the sin of killing a Brahmin. Also, don\u2019t do what brings you a bad name or what denies you a place in heaven.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d In the end, the warrior decided not to meet the princess and stayed back at home.<br \/><br \/>\u201cComing out for a walk in the night, Prapta noticed the rope outside the royal palace and curious to know what it is, went up the rope that took him inside the princess\u201d bedroom. The princess mistook him for the warrior and served him dinner and with great ecstasy told Prapta, \u201cI have fallen in love with you at the very first sight. I am yours. You are in my heart and nobody except you can be my husband. Why don\u2019t you say something.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cHe replied, \u201cMan gets what he is destined to.\u201d The princess immediately realized that this man was not the warrior she saw in the day and asked him to leave the palace at once. She made sure that he climbed back the way he came. Prapta left the place and slept that night in a rundown temple.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThe sheriff of the city came to the same temple where he had arranged to meet a woman of vice. He saw Prapta sleeping there and to keep his meeting a secret, he asked Prapta who he was. Prapta recited the verse about destiny. The sheriff then said, \u201cSir, this is a bad place to sleep. You can go to my house and sleep there tonight in my place.\u201d The merchant\u2019s son agreed to the proposal.<br \/><br \/>\u201cAt the sheriff\u2019s house, his young and beautiful daughter Vinayawati had asked her lover to come and meet her secretly there in the night. When Prapta came there following the sheriff\u2019s advice, Vinayawati mistook him in the darkness for her secret lover. She arranged a feast for him and married him according to Gandharva tradition. Noticing that Prapta did not utter a word, the sheriff\u2019s daughter asked him to say something. Prapta recited his usual verse. Vinayawati realized her mistake and asked him to leave at once.<br \/><br \/>\u201cAs Prapta once again took to the street, he saw a marriage procession entering the city led by the bridegroom named Varakirti. He joined the procession. The bride was the daughter of a very wealthy merchant of the city. This procession reached the wedding hall sometime before the scheduled time for the wedding.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThe bride\u2019s father set up a costly and gaily decorated dais for the wedding. The bridal party came to the scene of wedding a bit in advance. In the meantime, an elephant went berserk and killing the mahout headed for the marriage venue. The bridegroom and his party joined the frightened people who were fleeing the scene of marriage.<br \/><br \/>\u201cPrapta happened to see the frightened bride alone and abandoned on the dais shivering in fear. He jumped on to the dais and told the merchant\u2019s daughter that she need not fear for her life and that he would save her at any cost. With great courage and presence of mind he approached the elephant with a stick and began to threaten him. The elephant luckily left the scene. Prapta took the bride\u2019s hand into his as a token of assurance.<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhen peace returned, Varakirti and his friends and relatives also returned to the dais and seeing the bride\u2019s hand in the hand of a stranger, addressed the merchant, \u201cSir, you have pledged the hand of your daughter to me. But I see that you have given her away to someone else. This is improper.\u201d The merchant replied, \u201cMy son, I don\u2019t know anything. I also ran away from the dais. Let me ask my daughter.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The daughter told her father, \u201cThis brave man saved me from the mad elephant. He is my savior. I won\u2019t marry anyone but him.\u201d It was now dawn and hearing the commotion the royal princess also came to the wedding venue to see what happened. The sheriff\u2019s daughter also came there learning what had happened.<br \/><br \/>The king also came there and asked Prapta to tell him everything without fear. Prapta as usual recited the verse.<br \/><br \/>This verse rang a bell in the princess head. She remembered what happened in the night and thought \u201cEven God cannot undo what is destined.\u201d The sheriff\u2019s daughter also recalled the events of the night and thought<br \/><br \/>\u201cThere is nothing to regret nor cause for surprise.\u201d Listening to what Prapta said, the merchant\u2019s daughter also thought \u201cnobody can take away what destiny gives me.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cThe king now knew everything and the mystery of the verse. He then gave away his daughter in marriage to Prapta and also a thousand villages as gift. He also crowned Prapta as the prince. The sheriff also married his daughter to Prapta. The merchant\u2019s son lived happily ever after with his wives and parents.<br \/><br \/>Hiranyaka, the mouse, thus ended his story of troubles and said:<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<blockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>\u201cEven God cannot undo<\/strong><\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What is destined<\/strong><\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>There is nothing to regret<\/strong><\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Nor cause for surprise<\/strong><\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Nobody can take away<\/strong><\/span><br \/><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What destiny gives me.\u201d<\/strong><\/span><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br \/>\"I am disillusioned.

He was an expert at making fine garments worthy of kings and princes. He enjoyed the patronage of the nobility. Despite all this, he was poorer than those weavers who were making coarse cloth for the common people. Worried at his condition, he told his wife,<br \/><br \/>\u201cLook dear, how rich these weavers of coarse cloth have become. There is something wrong with this place. I am not a success here.

Just as sun and shade are inseparable, cause and effect are also linked to each other.<\/strong><\/span>\u201d<br \/><br \/>Somilaka did not agree with her. He said, \u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Without effort, you can achieve nothing. Without cause there is no effect. Even if you get a good meal as a result of a good deed in the past, you have to use your hand to eat it. Wealth comes to a person who toils. There is no point in chanting the name of God. You must do your bit first. If you are not successful despite your effort, you are not to blame.<\/strong> <\/span>Therefore, I have decided to go abroad.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Ignoring his wife\u2019s pleas, Somilaka left his place and reached Vardhamanapuram. Working day and night, he earned three hundred gold sovereigns within three years. He thought he should go home now and started the homeward trek. At dusk he found himself in the middle of a forest. Wild animals began their hunt for prey.<br \/><br \/>The weaver climbed a tall tree and went to sleep on a big branch. He saw a dream:<br \/><br \/>The God of Action and the God of Destiny were talking to each other. Destiny asked Action, \u201cThe weaver is not destined to live in luxury. Why did you give him three hundred sovereigns?\u201d Action replied, \u201cI have to give to those who try and toil. Whether the weaver can keep it or not is in your hands.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The dream jolted the weaver. He looked into his bag and found the sovereigns missing. Heart-broken, Somilaka began crying, \u201cOh I have lost what I have earned in three years with great effort. I have become a poor man again. I cannot go home in this condition and show my face to my wife.\u201d He saw no point in brooding over what has happened and decided to go to Vardhamanapuram and try again.<br \/><br \/>This time, he could collect five hundred sovereigns in one year. He stored all this money in a small bag and began his homeward journey. When it was sundown, he had already entered a forest. This time, he did not sleep, afraid that he would lose his money. He continued to walk through the forest. This time also he saw those two persons he saw earlier in his dream coming in his direction.<br \/><br \/>They repeated the same conversation about God rewarding a hardworking person and destiny denying it. He immediately looked into his bag and found there was no gold in it. This time Somilaka lost his courage and thought he should commit suicide. He made a strong rope with the fibers he found in the forest. He tied one end of the rope to a high branch of the tree and made a noose of the other end. Everything was ready for his suicide when he heard a voice in the skies:<br \/><br \/>\u201cO Somilaka, don\u2019t be rash. I am destiny who took away your wealth. I cannot give you more than what is necessary for your bare needs. Not a single cent more. But I am pleased with your adventurous spirit. Ask for a boon. I shall give it.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cPlease give me lots of wealth,\u201d said the weaver.<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat do you do with so much money,\u201d asked the voice.<br \/><br \/>The weaver replied, \u201cPeople serve him who is rich even if he is a miser.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cIn that case, go back to Vardhamanapuram where two wealthy merchants, Guptadhana and Upabhuktadhana are doing business. After studying them well, decide who you want to become, Guptadhana, the man who earns a lot of money but does not spend a cent of it or Upabhuktadhana, the man who earns but also enjoys the wealth he has amassed.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Somilaka followed their advice and went back to Vardhamanapuram reaching the place in the evening after a tiring journey. With great difficulty he traced Guptadhana\u2019s house and entered it despite resistance from the merchant\u2019s family. When the time for dinner came, the merchant grudgingly gave food to Somilaka, suggesting that he was an unwanted guest. The weaver found a corner in the house where he could sleep.<br \/><br \/>Somilaka again had the same dream in which Action and Destiny were debating Guptadhana giving food to him.<br \/><br \/>Destiny told Action, \u201cYou have made Guptadhana give food to Somilaka.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Action said, \u201cYou cannot blame me. I had to ensure that Somalika was fed. It is for you to decide who deserved what.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Next day, Destiny saw to it that Guptadhana had an attack of cholera and had to miss his meal. In this manner what was given away was saved.<br \/><br \/>Later, Somilaka visited Upabhuktadhana\u2019s house where the host welcomed him with great love and respect.<br \/><br \/>The weaver had a good meal and slept. He had a dream as usual, the same two figures appearing in the dream.<br \/><br \/>Destiny told Action, \u201cO Action, the host has spent a lot of money to entertain Somilaka. He even borrowed to make the guest happy. It is not in his destiny to have surplus. How will he repay what he has borrowed?\u201d<br \/><br \/>Action replied, \u201cMy job is to see Somilaka got what he deserved. If Upabhuktadhana crossed the limits in entertaining his guest, that is not my fault. It is for you to decide what should be done.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Next day, a messenger from the royal household came to Upabhuktadhana and gave him a big sum of money on behalf of the king.<br \/><br \/>Somilaka thought, \u201cIt is better to be like Upabhuktadhana. He enjoys life with whatever he has. What\u2019s the use of being rich but miserly? I will better be Upabhuktadhana.\u201d Pleased, the Gods showered on him the wealth that he needed to enjoy life.<\/p>"},"settings":null,"created_at":"2023-08-20 08:22:36","updated_at":"2023-08-22 04:50:34"},{"position":"29","owner_id":"220815454","attribute":"value","value":{"story":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">2.7.\u00a0 The rescue of a deer<\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<p>Mandharaka ended the story of Somilaka telling Hiranyaka and Laghupatanaka that <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>a rich person who does not spend money is as poor as any poor person can be<\/strong><\/span>.

But the hunter saw him and bound him to his bow and slung it across his shoulder and began going home.<br \/><br \/>Hiranyaka saw this from a distance and began reflecting, \u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Troubles do not come in singles.<\/strong><\/span> I have already lost everything I have.

Recovering, Hiranyaka said, \u201cLet\u2019s not brood over the past. Let us first look for a way to rescue the turtle.\u201d The crow said, \u201cListen, and do as I tell you. Chitranga will go to a small lake on the hunter\u2019s way taking him home. He should pretend he is dead and I will sit on his head and pretend pecking his eyes. Seeing the motionless deer, the hunter will then rest the turtle on the ground and reach for the deer. Hiranyaka should at once reach the turtle and bite off the strings binding him to the bow.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cAll right, we will do as you say,\u201d said the mouse and the deer. Meanwhile, the hunter, seeing the motionless deer, thought it was dead. Leaving the turtle on the ground, he came to the deer. The deer at once ran away and the crow flew away. At the other end, the mouse bit off the strings binding the turtle to the bow. The turtle entered water and the mouse ran to his hole.<br \/><br \/>Disappointed, the hunter returned to where he had rested the turtle. When he found that the turtle had escaped, he cried bitterly and went home. After making sure that they were far away from the hunter\u2019s reach, the four friends gathered and celebrated their reunion.<br \/><br \/>Concluding his discourse, Hiranyaka said, \u201c<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>It is a lesson to mankind on the value of friendship.

The tree had hundreds of branches. Their king, known as Meghavarna, set up strong fortifications to ensure security for his brood. Similarly, the owls of the town made a nearby cave their colony. They also had a king, called Arimardana, who ruled with the help of a strong and cunning army.<br \/><br \/>The owl king kept a close eye on the banyan tree and on account of previous enmity killed every night any crow he sighted outside the tree.

They were not happy because for several years there had been no rains and all the lakes, tanks, ponds and water holes in the forest became arid. The subjects went in a delegation to the king and appealed to him, \u201cO mighty king, there is no water to drink in the forest. Many of the younger ones are on the verge of extinction.

The plan is to tell the elephant king that the Moon does not like the elephants visiting the lake for water because they are killing and maiming hundreds of hares. The Moon has declared the lake out of bounds for the elephants.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Some others agreed and said, \u201cYes, there is a hare whose name is Lambakarna. He is an expert negotiator. He can do the job with success.\u201d<br \/><br \/>After a lot of discussions, the hares decided to send Lambakarna to the elephant king.

He used to daily worship Fire. It was the month of Magha (February). The sky was full of clouds and it had already started raining. Sarma left for a neighboring village at that time to seek the gift of a sacrificial lamb from some rich man. He called on a well-to-do man in the village and requested him to make him a gift of a healthy lamb for sacrifice to Gods.

Soon after sunset, the owl king, accompanied by his ministers and followers, set out to kill all the crows. They reached the tree, home of the crows, and surrounded it.<br \/><br \/>Not finding a single crow there and happy for that reason, Arimardana told his men to look for the crows so that they could chase them and kill them. Meanwhile, Sthirajeevi, who suffered mock injuries, began weakly moaning to attract the attention of the owls.<br \/><br \/>When the owls saw this and rushed to kill him, he pleaded, \u201cSir, my name is Sthirajeevi and I am minister of Meghavarna, the king of crows. Before you kill me, I have something to convey to your king.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Arimardana came to see the minister at once and asked him the reason for his plight. Sthirajeevi told him,<br \/><br \/>\u201cOur king wanted to avenge the massacre of his subjects by your men.

He was a farmer but the piece of land he cultivated gave him very little to survive. One day, unable to stand the heat of the summer sun, he went to a big tree in his land to rest for a while. Before he could spread himself on the ground he saw in the nearby anthill a huge cobra swaying with his hood open.<br \/><br \/>He thought, \u201cThis cobra must really be the Goddess of this land. I have never worshipped her, which is why I am not able to get anything from the land. From today, I will worship her.\u201d<br \/><br \/>At once he went back to his village and returned with a glass full of milk.<br \/><br \/>He poured it in a bowl and turned to the anthill and said, \u201cO ruler of the land, I did not know you were living in this anthill. That is why I have not paid my tribute to you. Please excuse me and accept this humble offering.\u201d<br \/><br \/>He then placed the bowl of milk at the anthill and left the place.<br \/><br \/>Next day when the Brahmin came to his land before the Sun was up, he saw a gold coin in the bowl he had left at the anthill. Henceforth, he came alone every dawn, collected the coin, offered the milk in the bowl and left. One day the Brahmin, leaving for another village on business, asked his son to go to the anthill and offer milk. When the son went the next day, he found a gold coin in the bowl.<br \/><br \/>He collected the coin and thought, \u201cThis anthill must be full of gold. If I kill the cobra, I can collect all the gold in one go instead of coming here every day.\u201d<br \/><br \/>He then struck the cobra with a big stick. But the cobra deftly dodged the blow but stung the son to death with his poisonous fangs. Returning to his village the next day, Haridatta heard the story of his son\u2019s death and at once realized that greed was behind it.<br \/><br \/>The Brahmin went to the anthill the day after his son\u2019s cremation and offered milk to the cobra. Without coming out of his hole, the cobra told Haridatta,<br \/><br \/>\u201c<b>You have come here for gold forgetting that you had lost a son and that you were in mourning. The reason is greed, pure greed.<\/b> From today, there is no meaning in our relationship. Blinded by his youth, your son has struck me and I bit him back. How can I forget that blow? How can you suffer the grief of your son\u2019s death?<br \/><br \/>Finally, I am giving you this diamond, don\u2019t come back again.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Ending the story of the Brahmin and the cobra, Raktaksha told Arimardana, \u201c<b>The lesson is that love once betrayed cannot be regained.<\/b> If you kill this minister (Sthirajeevi) you will have no problems left.\u201d<br \/><br \/>After listening to Raktaksha patiently, the king of owls turned to his second minister Kruraksha and asked him for his opinion.<br \/><br \/>The second minister said, \u201cO my lord, I don\u2019t agree with the advice Raktaksha gave you. It is very unkind.<br \/><b><br \/>We should never kill a person seeking asylum.<\/b> There is a fine story about how, knowing that a hunter who sought shelter had in fact come to kill him, a dove offered himself as food to the hunter.\u201d<br \/><br \/>On the king asking him to relate that story, Kruraksha told him the following tale.<br \/><br \/>Once upon a time there lived a merciless hunter in the heart of a forest, terrorizing birds and animals.<br \/><br \/>Because of his cruel nature he had no friends or relatives. The elders have said,<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>\u201cIt is unwise to be close to<br \/>Men who are wicked and cruel.<br \/>Avoid such heinous persons as<br \/>You avoid poisonous snakes.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n<p><br \/><br \/>The hunter went out into the forest every morning with a stick and net. One day, he threw his net and trapped a female dove in it. Soon, thick and black clouds appeared in the sky and it began raining cats and dogs.<br \/><br \/>Scared and shivering, the hunter looked for shelter and found it under a huge banyan tree. The rain and wind stopped suddenly. The skies became clear with stars shining. The hunter said loudly,<br \/><br \/>\u201cIf there is anyone on the tree, I seek shelter and food from him. I am hungry and may faint any moment.\u00a0 Please save me.\u201d<br \/><br \/>At the same time, a dove that had his nest on the same tree was worried that his wife who had gone out had not come back. He prayed to Gods that his wife should not come to any harm in this wind and rain. He began telling himself,<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>\u201cBlessed and happy is the man<br \/>With a caring and loving wife.<br \/>A home is not a home without a wife;<br \/>A wifeless home is like a jungle.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n<p><br \/><br \/>The wife trapped in the hunter\u2019s net heard her husband\u2019s sorrowful words and, happy that her husband loved her so much, thought,<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>\u201cDon\u2019t call her a woman<br \/>Whose husband is unhappy;<br \/>Where happy husbands live<br \/>Heavens shower blessings.\u201d<\/blockquote>\n<p><br \/><br \/>Later, addressing her husband, the female dove said, \u201cListen to me, my dear. <b>Even at the cost of your life, you must come to the rescue of someone seeking shelter.<\/b> This hunter is suffering from cold and hunger and has sought shelter under our tree. You must serve him with devotion. Don\u2019t hate him because he has trapped your beloved wife. In reality, the strings of destiny have bound me. Give up all thoughts of revenge and serve the hunter with care.\u201d<br \/><br \/>In accordance with his wife\u2019s desire, the dove suppressed grief and told the hunter, \u201cSir, you are welcome to our modest home. Please let me know what I can do for you. Treat this as your own home and feel free to command me.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The hunter told the dove that he was suffering from a cold and needed relief. The dove flew out, brought fire from somewhere and lit a small fire with dry twigs and asked the hunter to warm himself.<br \/><br \/>The dove told the hunter, \u201cBecause of my past deeds, I was born poor and unfortunate and do not have enough to feed myself.<b> What is the point in a host living if he cannot entertain a guest? It is better that he renounce this world.<\/b>\u201d<br \/><br \/>Yet he thought that it was better to die than say no to a host. Determined to die, the dove told the hunter to wait for a while and that soon he will have food. Then circling over the fire, the dove jumped into the fire he lit for the benefit of the hunter.<br \/><br \/>Moved by this sacrifice, the hunter told himself, \u201cI am responsible for this tragedy. I will no doubt go to hell.<br \/><br \/>This dove is a great soul, he has shown me the right path. Hereafter, I will give up all wants and desires and slowly destroy this body. Nothing, neither cold nor sun nor wind, matters to me. I will fast and see my slow end.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The hunter then threw his net and stick and released the female dove from the net.<br \/><br \/>The wife then saw how her husband had jumped into the fire to provide food for the hunter. She thought that life without her husband was worse than death and at once jumped into the same fire that consumed her husband. After her death, she saw her husband in heaven wearing royal regalia.<br \/><br \/>On seeing her, the husband said, \u201cO my darling, you have done well to follow me into the fire. Women like you have lived happily with their husbands for 35 million years.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The dove couple lived happily ever after. The hunter, shunning worldly pleasures, went to a forest to realize God. As penance had cleansed him of all desires, the hunter burnt himself in a forest fire and attained nirvana.<br \/><br \/>After Kruraksha ended telling the king the hunter\u2019s story, Arimardana asked a third minister, Deeptaksha for his advice on dealing with Sthirajeevi.<br \/><br \/>The minister told the king, \u201cMy lord, Sthirajeevi does not deserve to be killed. He will be of use to us in revealing the secrets of the enemy. There is this story of how even a thief could help an old man.\u201d<br \/><br \/>On the king commanding him, Deeptaksha began telling him the story of the old man, his young wife and the thief.<\/p>"},"settings":null,"created_at":"2023-08-20 08:22:42","updated_at":"2023-08-27 04:04:15"},{"position":"35","owner_id":"220815454","attribute":"value","value":{"story":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">3.5.\u00a0 The Old Man, His Young Wife and The Thief<\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<p><span>There lived an old widowed merchant in a city in the south.

He was so poor that he never wore good clothes, used cosmetics, or indulged in the luxury of eating paan(betel leaves) . He had matted hair, an unshaven beard and uncut nails. He was extremely weak and emaciated because he had no cover from cold, sun or wind or rain. Taking pity on him, a rich man donated two calves to him.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>With all care and love, he fed them well with butter oil and grass. The calves grew into two fine and healthy animals. A thief set his eyes on them and decided that he should somehow steal them. As he set out for the Brahmin\u2019s house, he saw on the way an awesome figure with loose teeth as long and sharp as fangs, an arched nose and blood-red eyes. He had a lean body with varicose veins and his hair and beard looked like two torches.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Though he was frightened, the thief asked him, \u201cWho are you, sir?\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>\u201cI am Satyavachana, a monster.

When they were sure that the Brahmin had slept, the monster stepped in to kill the poor Brahmin. The thief held him back saying it was unjust to kill the Brahmin before he (the thief) could take away the two calves.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The monster said, \u201cIf the sound of the resisting calves disturbs the sleep of the Brahmin, all our effort will be in vain.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The thief replied, \u201cSuppose there is some obstacle in your killing him, I cannot take the calves. Therefore, wait till I finish my job first.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The thief and the monster began quarrelling about who should be the first to finish his job.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The Brahmin woke up due to the commotion they were making and asked them who they were and what was the matter.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The thief told him, \u201cThis monster wants to kill you.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The monster denied and said, \u201cO Brahmin, this thief wants to steal your calves.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The Brahmin then invoked his deity through prayer and the power of the prayer forced the monster to flee.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The Brahmin then took a stick and drove off the thief.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>\u201cThat is why,\u201d Vakranasa said, \u201cI had told you that if two rivals quarrel among themselves, we would be the beneficiaries.\u201d Then the king asked his fourth minister, Prakarakarna for his opinion.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The minister said, \u201cMy lord, I think we should spare the life of the crow.

He had a son who was very weak and growing weaker by the day. It was found that he had a snake in his stomach. Experts, physicians and surgeons tried to nurse him back to health without success. Dejected, the son left his palace one night and took shelter in a lonely and dilapidated temple in another town ruled by a monarch called Bali. Every day, the son would go out to beg and return to the temple in the night.<br \/><br \/>King Bali had two daughters who came of age. Following a tradition, the two daughters would get up every dawn and touch the feet of their father in reverence.<br \/><br \/>One day, after paying respects to the king one of his daughters said, \u201cVictory to the king. We are happy in every way.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The second daughter said, \u201cO king, reap the harvest of your actions.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The king, very angry at the words of the second daughter, called his ministers and told them, \u201cTake this foul-mouthed woman away and marry her off to some stranger. Let her reap the consequences of her actions.\u201d<br \/><br \/>In compliance with the orders of the king, the ministers took her away and married her without pomp or ceremony to Devasakti\u2019s son living in the old temple. The daughter considered the king\u2019s son as God\u2019s gift and after persuading him, left for another country.<br \/><br \/>The princess and the son of Devasakti reached a city where they camped close to a lake. She asked her husband to take care of the camp and went into the city with her maids to buy daily needs like rice, salt, butter oil and vegetables. After shopping, she returned to the lake where she saw a surprising spectacle.<br \/><br \/>The prince was sleeping, resting his head on an anthill. The serpent in his stomach came out to breath fresh air. Then another serpent emerged from the anthill for the same reason. Both of them glared at each other.<br \/><br \/>The anthill inmate said, \u201cYou wicked creature, why do you torment such a handsome prince.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The other serpent retorted, \u201cWhy are you polluting the two golden urns in your hole.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Thus in their row, they revealed the secrets of each other.<br \/><br \/>The serpent in the anthill told the other serpent, \u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant. Who does not know the secret of your death? If the prince drinks a concoction made of gruel and mustard you will die unsung.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cOh, is that so? You will also perish if someone pours hot oil or hot water in your anthill. Don\u2019t be too proud,\u201d said the serpent in the prince\u2019s stomach.<br \/><br \/>The princess, who heard all that passed between the two serpents, poured hot oil into the anthill and took the two golden urns and gave the mustard concoction to her husband and killed the serpent inside his stomach.<br \/><br \/>Both Divyasakti\u2019s son and his daughter-in-law returned to his kingdom and lived happily ever after.<br \/><br \/>After listening to this story, owl king Arimardana accepted his advice that Sthirajeevi\u2019s life should be spared.<br \/><br \/>Raktaksha, the first minister, was sad and told the ministers, \"You have misled the king by giving wrong advice and paved the way for his destruction. <b>The learned have said that where wicked men are honoured and wise men are insulted, there will be fear, famine and death.<\/b>\u201d<br \/><br \/>Disregarding the warning of Raktaksha, the king\u2019s men set out to take Sthirajeevi to their fortress.<br \/><br \/>On the way, Sthirajeevi said, \u201cMy lord, in my condition, I cannot be of any help to you. Why do you unnecessarily carry me to the fortress? I will jump into a fire and perish. Please permit me to do that.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Sensing his internal thoughts, Raktaksha asked him why he would want to end up in fire.<br \/><br \/>Sthirajeevi said, \u201cIt is for your cause I met this fate in the hands of Meghavarna.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Raktaksha said, \u201cYou are a cheat, good at spinning words. You were really born as a crow and even if you are born as an owl in your next birth, you will still be a crow in nature.

He went one morning to river Ganga to bathe. As he was reciting stanzas in praise of the Sun, he saw a kite carrying a mouse in its claws. At once, the sage aimed a stone at the kite. Hit by the stone, the kite released its prey and the mouse at once ran to the sage asking him for protection.<br \/><br \/>The kite addressed Salankayana and said, \u201cO sage, you have hit me with a stone, which is not proper. Are you not afraid of God? Surrender that mouse to me or you will go to hell.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The sage said, \u201cYou wretched bird, <b>my duty is to save God\u2019s creations, to punish the wicked, to respect the good, to honor the teacher and worship the Gods.<\/b> Why do you preach all those irrelevant rules of conduct to me?\u201d<br \/><br \/>The kite delivered a big lecture to the sage on the right path. \u201cYou have no idea of what is good and what is bad. God created all of us and at the time of creation also prescribed what should be our food. God has marked mice, other rodents and insects to be food for us. Why do you blame me for seeking what God has meant for me? <b>There is nothing wrong for anyone to eat the food marked for him. The danger comes when one eats what is not food for him.

She said that the Sun was very hot and she would prefer someone else. The sage then summoned the God of Clouds, the God of Wind and the God of Mountains. The girl rejected every one of them on one ground or the other.<br \/><br \/>Then the God of Mountains told the sage, \u201cThe most suitable candidate for your daughter is a mouse. He is more powerful than I am.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The sage then turned her into a mouse and gave her away to a king of mice in marriage.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d Raktaksha resumed, \u201cI want you to know that a crow is a crow and cannot become an owl.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Yet, disregarding Raktaksha\u2019s warnings, the king\u2019s men took away Sthirajeevi to their fortress not knowing that they were bringing ruin upon themselves and the king. Sthirajeevi thought on the way to his destination,<br \/><br \/>\u201cThis man (Raktaksha) alone advised the king to kill me. Of all of the king\u2019s men he alone knows statecraft.<br \/><br \/>If they had heeded his word and killed me the king would have escaped disaster.\u201d<br \/><br \/>When Sthirajeevi\u2019s procession arrived at the entrance of the fortress, king Arimardana ordered his men to accommodate him in a comfortable place of his choice. But Sthirajeevi had other ideas. If he had to hatch a plan to kill the king, it was not possible within the fort because he and his movements would be constantly under watch. That would alert his hosts. So, he thought, it was better to be outside the fort.<br \/><br \/>He told the king, \u201cMy lord, I am grateful for your generosity. But I am a politician and belong to the enemy camp. Yet I am your devotee and faithful servant. It does not become of me to live inside the palace.

The king\u2019s men took extraordinary care of his needs and very soon Sthirajeevi became as strong as a wrestler. Seeing Sthirajeevi\u2019s new personality, Raktaksha told the king and other ministers, \u201cI regard all of you as very unwise.

His droppings used to turn into gold as soon as they hit the ground. One day, a hunter came to the tree in search of prey and saw Sindhuka\u2019s droppings hit the ground and turn into gold.<br \/><br \/>The hunter, struck by wonder, thought, \u201cI have been hunting birds and small animals since I was a boy. I am now eighty years old. I have never seen in my life this kind of miracle.\u201d<br \/><br \/>He decided to get the bird somehow and set a noose for him. Not aware of the trap, the bird stayed on the branch merrily singing. Soon, the noose tightened and the hunter caught the bird and pushed him into his cage.<br \/><br \/>The hunter took it home and considered, \u201cIf the king comes to know of this wonder, he will certainly take away the bird from me. Instead, I will go to the king and present the unique bird to him.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The hunter took the bird the following day to the king and presented it to him with great reverence. The king was extremely happy and told his men to keep the bird in safe custody and feed him with the best bird food.<br \/><br \/>But his minister was reluctant to accept the bird.<br \/><br \/>He said, \u201cO Rajah, There is no use in trusting the word of this hunter and accepting the bird. Has anyone seen a bird dropping gold? Therefore, I request you to release the bird from the cage.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The king ordered the bird to be set free. As soon as the door of the cage opened, the bird perched himself on a nearby doorway and defecated. The dropping immediately turned into gold. Sindhuka then recited that line about fools, \u201cFirst, I was a fool. Then the hunter and then the king and his ministers.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Raktaksha continued, \u201cThat\u2019s why I tell you that we are all fools in sparing the life of this minister of the crows, Sthirajeevi.\u201d Despite Raktaksha\u2019s warnings, the owls continued to look after Sthirajeevi with great devotion. The crow minister became strong and powerful. Giving up all hopes of reforming his king and ministers, Raktaksha called his close colleagues and told them,<br \/><br \/>\u201cFriends, our king and his men are beyond reform. We have given whatever advice a minister has to give.\u00a0 We shall now leave this dangerous place and pitch our tents elsewhere. The elders have said, \u201c<b>He prospers who anticipates danger and escapes it. He who does not destroys himself.<\/b>\u201d I have been living in this jungle for so long, I have become old. Yet, in all my life I have never heard a cave speaking like a human being.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat, a cave speaking like a human being! Surprising. We have never heard of it. Please tell us all about it,\u201d asked his followers.<br \/><br \/>Raktaksha then told them the following story.<br \/><br \/>Deep in the rain forest lived a lion named Kharanakara. One day, he was very hungry and looked for prey in every nook and corner of the forest. There was no animal, big or small, as far as he could see. As he was wandering in search of food he found a big cave and thought, \u201cThere must be some animal living here. If so, it is bound to return to the cave in the evening. I will hide myself in the cave and when the animal returns, pounce on him and have a good meal.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Then as the sun began to set, Dadhiputcha, a jackal, came to the cave that was his home and saw the footprints of the lion entering the cave. There were, however, no traces of footprints to show that the lion had left. Scared, the jackal wanted to make sure that it was a lion or some big animal that went into the cave. But how should he know? He hit upon a brilliant idea.<br \/><br \/>The jackal went near the cave and began shouting, \u201cHello cave, I am your friend here.\u201d There was no reply from the cave. He did not know what to do. He again shouted, \u201cHello cave, don\u2019t you remember the arrangement we made? I have to shout when I arrive at the cave and you will ask me to come in. Without your green signal I do not enter the cave. Since you are silent, I will go to some other cave.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The lion heard the jackal speaking and thought, \u201cAh, there seems to be an arrangement between the cave and this animal. Let me get him into my trap. I will shout back a welcome to him and he will walk in happily.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The lion then roared, \u201cHi jackal, come in. You are welcome.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The jackal at once knew it was a lion inside the cave and hurriedly fled the place, remembering the lines of the learned,<br \/><b><br \/>\u201cHe survives who anticipates a danger and acts to avert it,\u00a0 He who does not come to grief.\u201d<\/b><br \/><br \/>Raktaksha said, \u201cThat is how we must also anticipate danger and act. Let us leave now before it is too late.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Listening to his advice, his ministers and others followed him to a far off place.<br \/><br \/>Seeing that the main obstacle in his way had disappeared and that the remaining king\u2019s men were all stupid, Sthirajeevi began piling up twigs on the pretext of building a nest. He heaped them at the entrance of the cave in which the king and other owls lived. When the pile was big enough, he waited for daybreak when the owls would become blind. Then he flew off to Meghavarna and told him that before word could reach the enemy camp of this plan, he and his followers should accompany him (Sthirajeevi) each carrying a piece of burning wood.<br \/><br \/>Accordingly, Meghavarna and his men followed Sthirajeevi, each carrying a burning twig in his beak. When they reached the entrance of the cave, which was now blocked by the pile of twigs Sthirajeevi built, they threw the burning twigs on the pile, which began to burn fiercely killing all the owls trapped inside.<br \/><br \/>When Megahvarna and his men returned to their kingdom, he asked Sthirajeevi to tell him how he could plan to kill the enemy.<br \/><br \/>Sthirajeevi said, \u201cIt was not an easy job living in the enemy camp. Luckily, except Raktaksha, every one of Arimardana\u2019s ministers was a fool. Yet it was like walking on the edge of a sword.

He was becoming old and worried that he would not be able to scare frogs any more and that would make him weak and bring his end closer.<br \/><br \/>With a plan in his head, he went to a lake and resting on its edge pretended that he had lost all interest in worldly matters.<br \/><br \/>A frog in the lake came out and asked him, \u201cUncle, why are you not praying for food as you used to do in the past?\u201d<br \/><br \/>The snake said, \u201cListen, my son, I am very unfortunate. How can I have any fervor for food? Last night when I was on my rounds looking for food I sighted a frog. When I tried to get at him, he jumped into the middle of a group of Brahmins reciting the Vedas. I could not track him. But soon I saw something like a frog near the Brahmins and at once jumped at him and bit him. It turned out to be the thumb of a Brahmin boy. The boy died immediately.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhen his father found that I had killed his son, he cursed me, \u201cYou wicked snake, you have killed my innocent son. From now onwards you will serve as a vehicle for all frogs. Your life will be at their mercy.\u201d I have now decided to serve my sentence. That is why I am here,\u201d said the snake.<br \/><br \/>The frog ran into the lake and told everyone about the snake and his offer to serve as a vehicle. Happy at the prospect, all the frogs went and met their king Jalapada and told him about the snake. \u201cWhat a wonderful news,\u201d thought the king and trooped out of the lake with his ministers and subjects. The king was the first to get on to the hood of the snake, followed by his ministers. In the order of seniority and prominence, the kings\u2019 subjects also climbed the back of the snake. Those unfortunate frogs that could not find space on the vehicle followed the snake in a procession. To entertain them, Mandavishya showed several feats he could do.<br \/><br \/>Thrilled by the experience of riding a deadly snake, Jalapada, the king of the frogs, thought that the ride had no parallel. No ride, whether on an elephant or a horse or a chariot or a palanquin, can match this experience, he thought.<br \/><br \/>On the second day, Mandavishya slowed down the pace of his haul. Noticing the change of pace, Jalapada asked the snake why he was not moving as briskly as he used to. The snake told the king of frogs that he had no food that day and being weak he was not able to carry so much load.<br \/><br \/>Jalapada, taking pity on the snake, said, \u201cYou can have the younger frogs for your food.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Thrilled at this offer, the snake said, \u201cO king of frogs, my plight is due to the curse the Brahmin gave me. Your magnanimous concession has released me today from the curse. I am so happy.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The snake thus began eating a few frogs every day and soon became strong and healthy. He was also worried that if he began eating the frogs at that rate there would not be any frogs left for him in the future.<br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, a big cobra chanced to come that way and seeing the snake carrying the frogs and struck by wonder asked the snake, \u201cThis is very unique though unnatural. How is it\u00a0that you have become a vehicle for frogs which are our natural food?\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cThat\u2019s a long story resembling the story of the Brahmin who pretended to have become blind after eating the good food his wife had made,\u201d said Mandavishya.<br \/><br \/>The cobra asked the snake to relate that story.<br \/><br \/>Once upon a time, a Brahmin named Yagnadatta lived in a city. He had a wife who was not trustworthy. She had a lover to whom she would secretly send every day delicious food she made. One day, her husband found out what she was doing.<br \/><br \/>He asked her, \u201cMy dear, you are making some special dish or the other and taking it out of the house. Tell me, what is the truth.\u201d<br \/><br \/>With great presence of mind, she told Yagnadatta, \u201cEvery day I am fasting and taking this food to offer to the Goddess.\u201d To allay suspicion, she collected food and telling her husband that she was leaving for the temple, and left home. The husband began following her secretly and when she went to the tank to bathe, he went to the temple of the Goddess and hid behind the idol.<br \/><br \/>After taking a bath in the tank, the Brahmin\u2019s wife came to the temple from the tank and began praying to the Goddess, \u201cO mother, tell me how can I render my husband blind?\u201d<br \/><br \/>The Brahmin, hiding behind the idol, changed his voice and said, \u201cO great devotee, you feed your husband daily with good and delicious food. Very soon he will become blind.\u201d<br \/><br \/>From then onwards, the wife began feeding her husband with delicacies. Soon, the Brahmin complained to the wife that he was not able to see clearly. The wife thought that the Goddess had at last fulfilled her desire.<br \/><br \/>Encouraged by the Brahmin\u2019s blindness, his wife\u2019s lover began visiting her without any fear. One day, Yagnadatta saw him and his wife together. The lover ignored him thinking the Brahmin was blind.<br \/><br \/>Yagnadatta then thrashed the lover so hard that he died. The Brahmin then cut the nose of his wife.<br \/><br \/>\u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d Mandavishya told the cobra, \u201cI am pretending to be friendly with the frogs.\u201d Jalapada, the king of frogs overheard this conversation and asked Mandavishya if what he had heard was true. The snake at once realized his mistake and told the king of frogs that it was all fun. The king of frogs foolishly believed the words of the snake and the snake slowly swallowed all the frogs.<br \/><br \/>Sthirajeevi told Meghavarna that he followed the tactics of Mandavishya in misleading his enemies. Pleased, the king of crows said, \u201cWhat you have said is correct. <b>Great men do not give up what they have begun even in the face of obstacles. Cowards, afraid of failure, do not venture at all. There are some that begin a task and give it up when there is a problem.

One day a crocodile named Karalamukha came out of the waters and loitering on the sands came to the tree.<br \/><br \/>Seeing the croc, the monkey said, \u201cO croc, you are my guest.

One day, an elephant badly injured the lion in a fight. The injuries were so serious that the lion could not go out hunting. As a result, the jackal also had to go without food.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Both the master and the servant became very weak. Unable to bear hunger, the jackal pleaded with the lion to get him some food.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>\u201cYou know my plight. I cannot move out of this place. However, if you manage to lure some animal to come here, I will kill him and both of us can have a good meal,\u201d said the lion.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>So, the jackal set out in search of some animal and saw a donkey feeding himself on weeds. The jackal approached him and said, \u201cO my friend, please accept my regards. I have not seen you for a long time. You have become very weak. What is the reason?\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The donkey said in sad tones, \u201cHow shall I tell you my suffering? The washer man is tormenting me by placing too much weight on my back. He does not feed me at all. I exist on weeds. That is why my body is weak.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The jackal said, \u201cIf that is the case, why don\u2019t you come with me? I shall show you a place where you can have your heart\u2019s fill of green and fresh grass. We can happily spend our time there.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>\u201cYou have given me good news. But there is a problem. We are domestic animals and you are all wild animals. One of them will certainly kill me,\u201d said the donkey whose name was Lambakarna.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Allaying his fears, the jackal said, \u201cO uncle, don\u2019t say like that. This place is in my control. Nobody can enter this area. Just like you are suffering at the hands of the washer man, there are three female donkeys in this area, which are waiting for a suitable husband. They are all young and told me, \u201cIf you are really our uncle, go and get a suitable husband for us.\u201d It is on that mission I have come here and seen you.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The donkey replied, \u201cIf that is the case, let\u2019s go now.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>That is why the elders have said,<\/span><br \/><br \/><span><blockquote>\u201cIf the very thought of a woman<\/span><br \/><span>Brings ecstasy to a young man<\/span><br \/><span>How thrilled would he be?<\/span><br \/><span>If he actually is in her presence.\u201d<\/blockquote><\/span><br \/><br \/><span>In the end, the jackal and the donkey reached the forest and came to the lion.

I have now realized how powerful you are.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Ashamed, the lion told the jackal quietly, \u201cO my friend, I was not ready for attack. Otherwise, even an elephant cannot escape my strike.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Satisfied, the jackal said, \u201cAll right, let us forget the past. I will bring the donkey here again.

Lambakarna was there on the bank of a lake feeding on grass.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>He came to the jackal and said, \u201cFriend, you have taken me to a nice place. I escaped death by inches. Who is that animal who had nearly killed me?\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>\u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d said Dhoosaraka, \u201cIt is, after all, the female donkey I promised to take you to. She was getting up to come and embrace you. You ran away in fear. She cannot live without you and so was trying to reach out to you. She told me that if you do not marry her, she would commit suicide. So please come and spare me the sin of causing the death of a woman. The God of Love will punish you if you do not heed my word.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Beguiled, the donkey followed the jackal. The lion was prepared for the attack this time and when the donkey came; he fell on him and killed him instantly. The lion asked the jackal to keep an eye on the donkey\u2019s body and left to take a bath in the river. Unable to resist the temptation of fresh flesh, the jackal snipped off the ears of the donkey and scooped his heart out and made a good meal of them. When the lion returned, he noticed that the ears and heart of the donkey were missing.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The lion angrily asked the jackal to tell him what had happened to the ears and heart of the donkey.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Dhoosaraka told him that the\u00a0<\/span><b>donkey had no ears and heart.<\/b><span>\u00a0If he had, he would not have come again.

One day, he drank a lot of liquor and got intoxicated and began running. He lost his balance and fell on broken pieces of a pitcher. The sharp edges of the pot pieces cut a big and bloody gash in his forehead. Somehow, he got up and went home. The wound took a long time to heal because he neglected to follow the instructions of the doctor.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Suddenly, a famine struck the whole country. The potter left the country with some others of the royal household. In the new country, he found a job with the king of that country. The king saw the mark of the big wound on his face and thought that Yudhishtira must have been a great warrior who suffered wounds in a battle. The king began showering special attention and affection on the potter, which the king\u2019s sons envied.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>They could not harm him because he was the king\u2019s favorite.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>When everything was going smoothly for the potter, a war came and the king was summoning all known warriors to honor them and prepare them for the war. The king\u2019s men were readying the elephants and horses for the combat while the soldiers were busy staging rehearsals. It was now time for the king to know everything about Yudhishtira.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>He sent for the potter and asked him when no one was around, \u201cWhat is your name, o warrior? In what battle were you injured?\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The potter told the king, \u201cMy lord, this is not a wound inflicted on me in a battle. I am a potter and my name is Yudhishtira. One day, when I was drunk, I ran and fell on sharp pieces of a broken pot. This scar on my face is the result of that fall.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Ashamed that he deceived himself by the speech and garments of the potter, the king asked his servants to throw out the potter.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>But Yudhishtira appealed to the king, \u201cMy lord, please don\u2019t throw me out. See how well I will fight.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The king said, \u201cI admit you are a warrior. But you are born in a potter community and hence cannot kill an elephant.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>\u201cHow is that,\u201d asked the potter.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The king then told him the following story.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>A lion couple lived in a forest. In course of time, the lioness delivered two lion cubs. Every day, the lion went out and brought food for the lioness. One day, the lion wandered all over the forest in search of food but could not find any prey at all. At sunset, the lion gave up his search and was returning home when he found a jackal cub. The lion took a fancy to him and took him home and gave him to his wife.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The lioness asked her husband, \u201cDid you get us any food today?\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>\u201cI found this cub. That\u2019s all,\u201d said the lion.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>\u201cI haven\u2019t killed him because he is a child. But if you are very hungry, you can have this child for your meal.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The lioness was angry and asked her husband, \u201cHow can I kill him when you spared him his life?\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The elders have said:<\/span><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><span>\u201cDon\u2019t do an unworthy deed<\/span><br \/><span>Even in the face of death;<\/span><br \/><span>Don\u2019t give up a worthy deed<\/span><br \/><span>Even if it means suicide.\u201d<\/span><\/blockquote>\n<p><br \/><br \/><span>\u201cI will treat him like my third son,\u201d said the lioness.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Thereafter, the new jackal cub became one of the family and the three ate, drank, played and slept together.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>One day when they were playing, an elephant passed by. At once, the two lion cubs got ready to attack the elephant. The jackal cub told them that the elephant was an enemy of the lions and that it was better for them to leave. The lion cubs were disappointed at the words of their jackal brother.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>They went home and told their father the details of how the jackal brother fled from the scene. The father was not happy with his children and admonished them. The lion took the jackal cub aside and told him not to discourage the lion cubs who, she said, were his younger brothers.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The jackal was hurt and asked his lion mother, \u201cHow am I different from them in beauty or education or bravery? Why should the two ridicule me? I will kill both of them.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Amused by the words of the jackal cub and wishing him long life, the lioness said, \u201cYou are still a child. I brought you up taking pity on you. Your brothers are also young. Before they grow old and know that you are different from them, leave this place and join your own folk.\u201d<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Realizing the danger ahead, the jackal cub left the lion family in search of his own folk.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>\u201c<\/span><b>That\u2019s why, before other warriors find out that you do not belong to the warrior caste, leave this place<\/b><span>,\u201d the king advised Yudhishtira.

This went on for sometime. The donkey became so strong and sturdy that it became difficult for the washer man to pull him to the peg and tie him to it.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>One day, when he was happily grazing at the wheat farm, the donkey heard the voice of a female donkey and began to respond to it in ecstasy.

He asked her to give her clothes also because he said clothes would hinder swimming. She gave away her clothes also. The trickster left with the bag and her clothes. Covering her naked body with her hands, the woman began waiting restlessly for the trickster to return. Just then a jackal with a piece of meat in his mouth happened to pass by. The jackal saw a fish that had come out of water and in trying to get at it he dropped the meat piece and ran towards it. But the fish, seeing the rushing jackal, jumped back into the water. Disappointed, the jackal went back to pick up the piece of meat. But a kite dived down fast and took it away before the jackal could reach it.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The woman laughed at the jackal that had lost the fish and also the piece of meat.

One day he was pained to realize that everyone else in his profession was rich and happy and that he alone was very poor. He thought Nagara was not the proper place for him to prosper and that he must go out and seek his fortune elsewhere. Then he left that city and began his journey to a new country. When the sun was fading, he reached a cave in a forest.<br \/><br \/>There he saw a female camel that separated from her caravan and just then delivered a child. The carpenter gave up his plans to go to another country and went home taking the camel and her calf with him. Every day he would go into the forest and bring back with him bundles of tender leaves for the camel and her child to eat. The camel regained her strength and the calf now became an adult. The carpenter began selling camel milk and making good money.<br \/><br \/>Ujjwalaka loved the camel so much that he bought a bell and hung it on her neck. One day he thought to himself, \u201cIf one camel can bring so much money for me, how much more would I earn if I buy more camels and sell their milk?\u201d He told his wife that he would borrow some money to go to Gujarat and buy a she camel and that she should take care of the camel and her calf till he returned from Gujarat.<br \/><br \/>He went to Gujarat and returned home with a she-camel. Slowly, the number of camels he had increased several times. He appointed a keeper to take care of the camel herd he had on the condition that he would give one camel to the keeper every year as remuneration. The keeper was also free to drink camel milk twice a day. Now, everything was fine for the carpenter and he and his wife thus lived happily ever after.<br \/><br \/>The camels used to go every day to a nearby forest to feed on the fresh green leaves available in plenty in the forest. After spending a lot of time in the forest, eating and playing, the camels trekked back home. But the senior she camel stayed on in the forest and joined the herd later. The other camels thought that the she camel was a fool to go her separate ways and what would she do if a wild animal attacked her.<br \/><br \/>One day a lion saw all the camels leaving the forest in a herd and the she camel staying back and loafing about. By the time she finished her leisurely grazing, the others left and reached home. The she camel lost her way and was in panic when the lion, which was following her, pounced on her and soon tore her to pieces.<br \/><br \/>\u201c<b>That\u2019s why I tell you that he who does not follow the advice of wise men perishes <\/b>like the camel,\u201d said the monkey.<br \/><br \/>The croc replied, \u201cYou are right, <b>if you follow advice given for your good you will face no danger either here or in the heaven above.<\/b> <b>Yet, what is great about doing good to a person who is good?

One day, he found the body of an elephant and was happy that it would have food for many days. However, he was not able to bite into the thick hide of the elephant and was circling around the body when a lion came that way. The jackal humbly prostrated before the lion and said, \u201cMy lord, I am your obedient servant. At your command, I am keeping a vigil on the body of the elephant. Please help yourself.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The lion said, \u201c<b>You know my friend, I do not eat something others have killed.<\/b> You may take it as my gift to you.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cI am touched by your magnanimity, my lord,\u201d said the jackal.<br \/><br \/>After the lion had left, a tiger came on the scene.

Let me try it.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The jackal then went half way to greet the tiger and said, \u201cO uncle, why are you entering this area of death?<br \/><br \/>The lion has killed this elephant and asked me to keep watch on it. He has gone to take a bath. Before going, he told me to inform him if any tiger happened to come here.

He told me that from that day he had sworn to kill all tigers.\u201d<br \/><br \/>These words frightened the tiger.<br \/><br \/>He told the jackal, \u201cSon, save my life. When the lion comes, don\u2019t tell him I had come this way. Please.\u201d<br \/><br \/>On receiving an assurance from the jackal, the tiger hurriedly left the scene. Then came a leopard.<br \/><br \/>The Jackal thought, \u201cThis fellow has strong and sharp teeth.

Why don\u2019t you be my guest? See this body of the elephant killed by the lion. He has asked me to keep an eye on the body. So, have a feast before he returns.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The leopard said, \u201cUncle, how can I accept your invitation. If I want to live long I should not touch this elephant. I will leave now.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The jackal assured him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you go ahead.

The lion is coming.\u201d<br \/><br \/>In this way, the jackal managed to get rid of the leopard also.<br \/><br \/>When the jackal began feasting on the elephant flesh, another jackal came that way.

Can I learn anything from his story,\u201d asked the croc.<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhy not?\u201d said the monkey and began telling him the story of Chitranga.<br \/><br \/>Chitranga was a dog living in a city in the south visited by famine for many years. Dogs began dying by the hundreds because there was no food. There was a danger that they would disappear as species. So, Chitranga left that city and came to a far-off city in search of food. There he found the house of a wealthy man whose wife was a lazy and careless woman who would not close the doors of the house.<br \/><br \/>Every day, Chitranga would sneak into the open house and have his fill. But he really could not enjoy his food because as soon as he came out of the house, street mongrels attacked him and severely wounded him.<br \/><br \/>Chitranga thought, \u201cOh, I made a mistake in coming here. <b>Home was better even if there was no food<\/b>. There was no struggle like this for food. Let me go home.\u201d<br \/><br \/>In the end, Chitranga left that city and returned home.<br \/><br \/>Seeing him return from abroad, Chitranga\u2019s friends asked him, \u201cTell us everything about the country you have visited. How are the people there? What is their culture?\u201d<br \/><br \/>The dog said, \u201cThe less said the better about that country. Everything is freely available because the women are careless. Yet your own kith and kin deprive you of this joy.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The croc was then impressed by the monkey\u2019s good advice and decided to fight the encroaching croc. He fought his enemy with great valor and killed him and regained the house occupied by him.

With these thoughts he fell asleep and had a dream. In his dream, a Jain monk appeared and said, \u201cO merchant, don\u2019t give in to self-pity. I am Padmanidhi, the treasure collected by your ancestors. Tomorrow morning when I will visit you in this guise, you will hit my head with a stick and I will turn into gold. You can live happily ever after.\u201d<br \/><br \/>When the merchant woke up the next morning he wondered whether what he saw in the dream was real or unreal. \u201cThis may not be true. It could just be an illusion because I have been thinking about money all the time,\u201d he thought and remembered the following poem:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cTheir dreams never come true<br \/>Who are sick, grief stricken,<br \/>Lovelorn and infatuated.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, a barber came to the merchant\u2019s house because his wife had called him for a pedicure. Very soon came the Jain monk who appeared in the merchant\u2019s dream. Manibhadra was happy to see him and at once reached for the stick and struck him on his head. The monk turned into a statue of gold. The merchant then gave clothes and money to the barber and told him not to pass this information to anyone.<br \/><br \/>The barber went home and thought, \u201cif a monk turns into gold if I strike him, I will invite all the monks and kill them and I can have lots of money.\u201d He passed the night with great difficulty. Next morning he went to the Jain monastery, went round its precincts three times and prostrated before the idol of Jinendra and sang the praise of the Jains thus:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cVictory to the Jain monks<br \/>Who keep lust and love at bay<br \/>Who turn the mind into a desert<br \/>Where desire does not grow.<br \/>Blessed are the hands that worship<br \/>The enlightened Jinendra<br \/>And blessed is the tongue<br \/>That praises the great Saint.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>After this prayer, the barber met the chief monk and knelt before him seeking his blessings. The monk blessed him and asked the barber the reason that brought him to the monastery. The barber pleaded humbly that the chief monk and others should accept his hospitality.<br \/><br \/>The chief monk said, \u201cO my son, we are not Brahmins who are invited home to be honoured. We are mendicants who visit Jain homes and accept what is necessary to keep us alive. Please go away and don\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Disappointed, the barber said, \u201cO great seer, I have made all preparations to receive you. Yet I cannot press you. You will do what you think is best.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The barber went home and kept a stick ready after checking the exits of the house. He went to the monastery again and stood there pleading with the monks to accept his offerings. Taking pity on the barber, the monks agreed to visit his home. The elders have rightly said:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cMan becomes old and infirm,<br \/>Loses his hair and teeth and<br \/>Cannot even hear and see properly.<br \/>Everything in his body<br \/>Degenerates but not desire.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>When the poor monks trooped into his house, the barber closed all the exits and began assaulting them.

The men saw what the barber had done and presented him before a magistrate. The barber admitted that he had killed some of the monks. The magistrate ordered that the barber be impaled.<br \/><br \/>The judges then said that no one should do like the barber without understanding the situation for the learned have said that <b>he who does things without discretion or prudence regrets his action <\/b>like the Brahmin\u2019s wife.<\/p>"},"settings":null,"created_at":"2023-08-20 08:22:58","updated_at":"2023-08-29 05:16:10"},{"position":"51","owner_id":"220815454","attribute":"value","value":{"story":"<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">5.2.\u00a0 The Brahmani and the Mongoose<\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<div>In a city in the north lived a Brahmin whose name was Deva Sarma. His wife delivered a son at the same time as a she-mongoose gave birth to a male child. The Brahmani (Brahmin\u2019s wife) adopted the mongoose\u2019s son and began bringing him as she would her own son. Yet the Brahmani never left her son alone because she did not trust the mongoose, fearing that she would some day harm her son. <b>The elders have said that one\u2019s own son, however immoral, ugly, foolish and wicked, are his parent\u2019s darling.<\/b> It is said that\u00a0<b>\u201cThe bonds of a son are stronger than the bonds of a friend, father, or well wisher.\u201d<br \/><\/b><br \/>One day, leaving for the lake to bring water, the Brahmin\u2019s wife told her husband to keep a watch on their son. Soon, a cobra entered the house. Fearing danger to the son of the Brahmin, the mongoose attacked the cobra and killed him. Hearing the footfalls of his mother Brahmani, the mongoose, with a mouth smeared by blood, went to greet her. When the mother saw the mongoose with his mouth oozing blood, thought that what she had feared had happened. Without a second thought, the Brahmin\u2019s wife threw the pot of water on the mongoose and the mongoose died as a result.<br \/><br \/>Mourning the death of the mongoose, the woman entered the house and found that her child was soundly sleeping in the cradle and also the cobra bitten to pieces by the mongoose. The woman was struck by grief that she had killed the mongoose that was like a son to her. Meanwhile, her husband returned and she began cursing him, \u201cYou miser, you didn\u2019t heed my word and went out for alms. Self-interest is good. Too much of it will earn a man the fate of Chakradhara,\u201d the Brahmani said.<br \/><br \/>\u201cWho is Chakradhara and what is his story?\u201d asked the husband. Following is his story as told by the Brahmin\u2019s wife.<br \/><br \/>Four young Brahmins were living in a city, suffering utter poverty. Unable to bear it, they thought, \u201cIt is better to live in a forest where only wild animals live and no human beings than to suffer poverty. Sleeping on a bed of grass is better than leading forever a life of want and suffering.\u201d<br \/><br \/>So, they packed their bags and set out in search of prosperity and happiness. <b>The learned have always said that the grief-stricken man always gives up truth, relatives, mother and even motherland.<\/b> It was no wonder that the four Brahmins left their place and after several sojourns reached the great city of Ujjain. They bathed in the Sipra river and went to the Mahakaleshwar temple. When they emerged from the temple after the worship of Kaleshwar, Bhairavananda Swami, a sadhu, greeted them. All of them prostrated before him in reverence and accompanied him to his monastery.<br \/><br \/>The Swami asked the young men, \u201cFrom where are you coming and where are you going? What brought you here?\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cWe are in search of prosperity. For us, it is either death or wealth. You know that adventurous people achieve their goals even if they have to sacrifice their lives. <blockquote>Destiny is all-powerful. Still, nothing can be achieved without human effort. Wells, tanks and ponds become full when it rains. But man too brings water out of the earth by digging deep wells.<\/blockquote> So, please show us a way to achieve our goal,\u201d the Brahmin boys pleaded with the Swamiji.<br \/><br \/>Moved by their plight and determination, the Swamiji gave them four sanctified tablets and told them, \u201cEach one of you takes a tablet and travel towards the Himalayas. Stop where the tablet slips out of your hand and look at that spot for treasures. Dig the treasures out and bring them back home and be happy.\u201d<br \/><br \/>They began their journey and after some days of travel, the tablet dropped from the hand of one of the four Brahmins. They stopped there and after digging the earth, they found plenty of copper. The first Brahmin told the others that all of them could mine as much copper as they could and take it home.\u00a0<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The others said,n\u201cWhat is there in copper? Let\u2019s go ahead.\u201d The first Brahmin said they could go if they wanted but he would go home taking all the copper he could carry.<br \/><br \/>The other three continued their journey till a tablet dropped to the ground from the hand of one of the three.<br \/><br \/>They dug there and found plenty of silver. The second Brahmin suggested that they should be happy with the silver they found and go home. The other two said he could take all the silver if he wanted. They would, however, continue their search for gold. The second Brahmin, happy with what he had found, took silver and went home.<br \/><br \/>Now, the remaining two Brahmins trekked some more distance until a third tablet dropped. The two dug there and found gold. The third man said that gold was better than copper and silver and they must now go back because there was nothing more precious than gold. The fourth Brahmin did not agree and replied that he would continue his search. The third man took the gold and went home.<br \/><br \/>It was now the turn of the fourth man. He was now tired and thirsty, and on top of it he had lost his way and began wandering aimlessly. Then he saw a man completely soaked in blood and a wheel whirring over his head like a halo. The Brahmin went near him and asked, \u201cSir, who are you and what is this wheel over your head? Can you show me a place where water is available?\u201d As he finished his questions, the wheel shifted from the stranger\u2019s head and came over the Brahmin\u2019s head.<br \/><br \/>Then followed a dialogue:<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat is this wheel which has come over my head,\u201d asked the Brahmin.<br \/><br \/>\u201cI have no idea.

He asked him how he got into that plight. Chakradhara told him what had happened so far.<br \/><br \/>Suvarnasiddhi then said, \u201c I told you in many ways not to be greedy.

Let us bring it to life using the knowledge we have acquired.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The first man said, \u201cOkay, I will use my learning to assemble the bones into a skeleton.\u201d With the power of learning he ordered all the bones to come together and become a skeleton.<br \/><br \/>When the skeleton was ready, the second man commanded flesh and blood to fill the skeleton and skin to cover it.<br \/><br \/>When the third man was about to bring life to the body, Subuddhi, who had only common sense, warned him,<br \/><br \/>\u201cLook, this looks like the body of a lion. If it comes to life, he will kill all of us.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The man who was to put life into the body of the animal told Subuddhi, \u201cYou are a fool. Do you think I will lose this opportunity to test my learning.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Subuddhi then told him to wait so that he could climb up a tree for safety and went up a tree. When the first man gave him life, the lion came alive and killed all the three learned men.<br \/><br \/>Suvarnabuddhi continued, That\u2019s why I have always said:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cEven if one is very learned<br \/>If he is without common sense<br \/>Becomes the butt of ridicule<br \/>Like the learned in this story.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>\u201cWhat is that story? Please tell me,\u201d asked Chakradhara. Suvarnasiddhi began to tell the story.<br \/><br \/>There lived four young Brahmin boys in a city. They were good friends eager to go out and acquire knowledge. They went to a place called Kanyakubj. They joined a monastery and began studying sciences and scriptures. After twelve years of learning they thought it was time to go home and asked their guru for permission to leave the monastery. After taking his permission, they started their homeward journey.<br \/><br \/>After a few days of travel, they reached a point where the road forked. They were not sure which road would take them home. Then they saw a funeral procession. One of the boys opened his book of learning and read out \u201c<b>Follow the path taken by great men<\/b>.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The boy told his other friends, \u201cLet us join and follow these great men leading the funeral procession.\u201d<br \/><br \/>They thus followed the procession to the cremation ground where they met a donkey.<br \/><br \/>The second Brahmin boy opened his book of shastras and found this verse in it:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cHe who comes to your aid<br \/>In times of danger, famine,<br \/>Cremation and invasion<br \/>Is truly a friend indeed.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>Then he told his friends that the donkey was, therefore, their best friend. At once one of them held on to the neck of the donkey. Another washed his feet. After this ceremony, they looked around and found a camel.<br \/><br \/>The four of them began figuring out what the animal was. The third man opened his book of knowledge and read out, \u201cWhat moves fast is righteousness\u201d and decided that the camel must be the embodiment of righteousness.<br \/><br \/>The fourth man referred to his book and found that <b>righteousness and friendship should always be together<\/b>.<br \/><br \/>They then tied the donkey and the camel together. Informed of this, the donkey\u2019s owner rushed to beat the four Brahmins. But they escaped before he came. They continued to travel till they reached a river and found a big leaf floating over the water.<br \/><br \/>One of them saw it and, remembering a line from a verse describing how a leaf helped a man cross the river, jumped on it and was being carried down by the current. A second Brahmin saw his friend in distress and remembered a verse:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cWhen total loss stares in the face<br \/>A wise man sacrifices half and<br \/>Manages with what remains.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>So, with a view to save half of his friend, the second Brahmin cut off the head of the drowning man.<br \/><br \/>The remaining three resumed their travel only to stop when three villagers invited them for a feast. When the host served a dish resembling noodles to the first Brahmin, he thought \u201cwhat is long should be discarded\u201d and left the place without food.<br \/><br \/>The second man was served pancakes. He thought, \u201cWhat spreads is not good for health\u201d and refused to eat.<br \/><br \/>Doughnuts were served to the third Brahmin. He remembered that \u201cThere is a peril where there is a hole\u201d and left. The three Brahmins later went home.<br \/><br \/>Suvarnasiddhi ended the story and turned to Chakradhara and told him:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cEven if one is very learned<br \/>If he is without common sense<br \/>Becomes the butt of ridicule<br \/>Like the learned in this story.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>Chakradhara protested, \u201cThat is not true,\u201d and quoted this verse:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cWhat God chooses to save<br \/>Survives sans human effort and<br \/>No human effort can save<br \/>What God ordains to perish.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>As the frog said, \u201c<b>the one with thousand tricks sat on the head of the fisherman, the one with hundred tricks is hanging by the fisherman\u2019s arm and I with only one trick am happily swimming in the water.<\/b>\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cHow is that?\u201d asked Suvarnasiddhi.

The Tale of Two Fish and a Frog<\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<p>Two fish named Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi made a lake their home. They had a frog as a friend whose name was Ekabuddhi. Every day, they used to meet on the bank of the lake and discuss everything under the sun and disperse at sunset. One day, they saw some fishermen equipped with nets and each carrying a basket full of fish came that way and saw the lake and noticed that it was full of good fish. They told themselves that they should come early the next morning and bait the fish.<br \/><br \/>The fish heard their conversation and were very worried. Then the frog asked Satabuddhi for advice.<br \/><br \/>\u201cO Satabuddhi, you have heard what the fishermen were planning. Now tell us what we should do.

Next day, the fishermen came and netted a lot of fish, frogs, crabs, turtles etc. and also Satabuddhi and Sahasrabuddhi and killed all of them. One of them carried Satabuddhi on his head because he was heavier and slung Sahsrabuddhi to his arm because he was long.<br \/><br \/>Ekabuddhi showed this scene to his wife and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you what the fishermen will do? Now, see the plight of Satabuddhi and Sahasrabuddhi.\u201d<br \/><br \/>At the end, Chakradhara said, \u201cO Suvarnasiddhi, <b>you said that wisdom is superior to knowledge.

At night when there was no work, he used to trespass into farms outside the village and would come home at dawn for fear of assault by farm owners. One day Uddhata happened to meet a jackal in a farm outside the village and both soon became friends.<br \/><br \/>Every night they would go together to the cucumber farms and sumptuously feed on cucumber. At dawn, they would go home after they had their fill. One day, in a happy mood, the donkey told the jackal, \u201cMy son, look, how pleasantly serene the night is. It inspires me to sing. Tell me what raaga would you like me to begin with?\u201d<br \/><br \/>The jackal said, \u201cUncle, why do you unnecessarily invite a peril? We have come here to stealthily rampage cucumber crops. Pimps and thieves must always observe silence. Haven\u2019t the learned said:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cHe who cannot control cough<br \/>Or cannot keep sleep at bay<br \/>Or cannot resist good food<br \/>Should not burgle a house.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>\u201cYour music has no melody.

It is only the very lucky people who are destined to listen to music sung in moonlight,\u201d said Uddhata.<br \/><br \/>The jackal replied, \u201cTrue. But you do not know what music is. You know only to bray loudly. So, please give up your foolish idea.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The donkey was angry and retorted, \u201cYou are an idiot to say that I don\u2019t know music. Sage Bharata was the author of music, which is regarded as the fifth Veda with hundred and eighty-five notational patterns. To Gods, nothing is dearer than music. It is through music that Ravana won favours from Lord Shiva. \u201c<br \/><br \/>The jackal said, \u201cAll right uncle, let me first get out of this farm and keep a watch outside to alert you if anyone comes this way. You can then leisurely sing to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d The jackal then left the scene quietly.<br \/><br \/>The moment the donkey began singing, one of the watchmen woke up and struck it with a stick till he dropped to the ground. The watchman then brought an old millstone and hung it to the donkey\u2019s neck.

One day, when he was weaving clothes, the wooden frames necessary for weaving were totally damaged. He went to the forest to bring wood to make new frames. From the forest he drifted towards the seashore where he saw a gigantic tree and thought that if he could cut wood from the tree it would stand him in good stead throughout his life.<br \/><br \/>As he started to cut the tree, a Yaksha living on that tree said, \u201cO weaver, this tree is my home. So I have to protect it. I am very comfortable here enjoying the cool breeze coming from the sea.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Mandharaka said, \u201cSir, If I do not cut the tree and take home its wood, my family will starve and die. So, please go somewhere else. I have to cut this tree.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cAll right, if you do not cut the tree, I will give you a boon of your choice,\u201d said the Yaksha.<br \/><br \/>The weaver said, \u201cSir, in that case, I will go home and consult my wife and friends. You can give me the boon later.\u201d<br \/><br \/>On the Yaksha agreeing to it, Mandharaka went home and on his way he met his friend who was a barber and asked him, \u201cFriend, a Yaksha has given me a boon of my choice and given me time to consult friends and my wife. What boon do you want me to ask him?\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cAsk him to give you a kingdom. You will be the king and I will be your minister. Both of us can enjoy life here and hereafter,\u201d said the barber.<br \/><br \/>\u201cTrue. But let me ask my wife also,\u201d said Mandharaka. The barber warned the weaver against consulting his wife and said quoting learned people:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cA wise man can give to his woman<br \/>Fine clothes, pearls and diamonds;<br \/>But never consult her on his affairs<br \/>Because women have low wits.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>And as Shankaracharya said, <b>\"a home that is run by women or children or tricksters will meet ruin in the end.\u201d<\/b><br \/><br \/>The weaver gently ignored the advice of the barber saying that he would nevertheless consult his wife and went home. He told his wife the whole story of the Yaksha and the boon he had offered.<br \/><br \/>Mandharaka also told his wife that his friend, the barber, had advised him to ask for a kingdom. His wife said, \u201cO my lord, how intelligent is a barber? Never listen to his words. <b>No wise man would consult children or barbers or servants or beggars<\/b>. Also,<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cKingship has too many problems;<br \/>Conspiracies take away your peace.<br \/>With the crown come not only thorns<br \/>But also sinister plots and treason.<br \/>It was for the sake of kingdom<br \/>Lord Rama lived in the woods,<br \/>Pandava brothers fled into exile,<br \/>The Yadava dynasty disappeared,<br \/>King Nala embraced anonymity.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cTherefore, <b>no wise man will invite kingship that leads to killing brothers, friends and relatives<\/b>,\u201d<\/blockquote>\u00a0said the weaver\u2019s wife.<br \/><br \/>The weaver replied, \u201cMy dear, what you say is true. But you haven\u2019t told me what boon I should choose.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The wife said, \u201cEvery day you are able to weave a single piece of cloth. That\u2019s barely enough to meet our daily needs. Therefore ask the Yaksha to give you another head and two more hands. That helps you to weave two pieces of cloth every day instead of one. The first piece will help us meet our daily needs. The second one will help us meet special needs. We can sail through life comfortably and happily.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The weaver was happy with the advice his wife gave and went to the Yaksha and prayed to him, \u201cSir, you have kindly given me a choice. I request you to give me two more hands and an extra head.\u201d<br \/><br \/>At once, he had four hands and two heads. Happily, he began his homeward journey.

He stored such flour in an earthen pot and when it was full he hung the pot to a peg above his bed so that he could keep an eye on it.<br \/><br \/>He returned home one day very tired and went to sleep and began dreaming: \u201cThis pot is full of flour and if there is a famine it would fetch me a very high price.

As the learned have said,<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cHe who is overwhelmed by greed<br \/>And doesn\u2019t weigh its consequences,<br \/>Will become a victim of deceit<br \/>Like King Chandra in this story.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>Suvarnasiddhi then told the story of King Chandra to Chakradhara.<br \/><br \/>Once upon a time there was a king named Chandra ruling a small state. His children were fond of playing with monkeys. So the king ordered a number of monkeys to be brought to the palace and asked his servants to feed them well and look after their needs. The leader of the monkeys was an old scholar well versed in statecraft, specially the works of Sukracharya, Brihaspati and Chanakya. The old monkey trained the younger ones also in statecraft.<br \/><br \/>The king had a stable of goats that his young sons used to ride. One of the goats was fond of food and would daily sneak into the kitchen at any time of the day and make a clean sweep of whatever was available in the kitchen. If the cook chanced to see him stealing food, he would throw at it whatever was handy, a stick or a brass pot.<br \/><br \/>The monkey leader saw this drama between the cook and the wily goat and thought: \u201cI am sure this tussle between the cook and the goat will lead to the ruin of my tribe. <b>This goat has become a slave to food<\/b>. The cook will throw it at whatever is nearby. It may be a stick or if it is not readily available he may use an ember from the hearth to throw at the goat. This will set ablaze the goat\u2019s fur-covered body making him run into the stable that would soon catch fire and burn the horses. The great veterinarian Salihotra has said the fat of monkeys is the best medicine for burns. That will be the end of monkeys.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The monkey leader then summoned all the younger ones and told them that the feud between the cook and the goat would certainly do harm to them. In their own interest they should leave the palace as early as possible. He quoted the scholars saying:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cHe who wants to live in peace<br \/>Must leave a house of daily strife.<br \/>Conflict breaks up kingdoms<br \/>Like bad words separate friends\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>The younger ones, however, refused to listen to the advice of the old monkey. They told the leader, \u201cSir, you have become old and senile. We are not going to leave this palace where we have the best food available. What do we get there to eat in the jungles? We cannot eat indifferent food in the forest.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Extremely unhappy at their response, the old monkey said, \u201cYou have no idea of the price you will pay for the comforts of the palace. They won\u2019t last long. I cannot see the end of our tribe. I am leaving. <b>He who spares himself the spectacle of a friend in distress, of his house occupied by an enemy or of the division of his country, is the happiest.<\/b>\u201d<br \/><br \/>The old monkey left all of them with a heavy heart.<br \/><br \/>Some days later, the wily goat entered the royal kitchen and the cook, failing to see anything handy to punish it, took out a burning piece of wood from the hearth and hurled it at the goat. His fur afire, he ran in panic into the stable where his burning body set ablaze the hay stacked there. Several horses perished in the fire.<br \/><br \/>The king consulted expert veterinarians who advised him to use monkey fat as a cure for horses suffering from burns.<br \/><br \/>The king ordered all monkeys to be killed and their fat used to heal the burns of the horses. The old monkey was distressed by the death of her progeny and began planning as to how he could take revenge on the king for killing all monkeys. Wandering restlessly in the forest, the old monkey saw a lake full of lotuses. On deeper inspection of the lake, the senior monkey found footprints of animals and human beings entering the lake but not footprints leaving the lake.<br \/><br \/>The monkey at once realized that there must be some wicked crocodile in the lake and that it was better to drink water with the tube of a lotus. As he began drinking water, a monster emerged from the lake wearing a pearl necklace. The monster addressed the monkey and said, \u201cYou seem to be an intelligent chap. You drank water without entering the lake. I am impressed by the presence of your mind. Ask anything you want.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The monkey asked, \u201cSir, how many lives can you take in one go?\u201d<br \/><br \/>The monster said,<b> \u201cI can swallow tens, hundreds and thousands at one time. All this I can do only when they enter the lake. Outside the water, even a jackal can challenge me.\u201d<\/b><br \/><br \/>The monkey said, \u201cI have to settle scores with a king. If you can lend me the pearl necklace on your body, I will somehow persuade the king and all his men to enter the lake for hidden wealth. Then you can kill all of them.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Trusting the monkey, the monster gave him the pearl necklace. The monkey reached the kingdom of Chandra. People saw the dazzling necklace and asked him how he got it. The monkey told them about the lake. When the word reached the king, he sent for the monkey and asked him how he got the necklace.<br \/><br \/>With the monkey telling him everything about the lake, the king, led by the monkey, and accompanied by his family, ministers and followers, reached the lake. The monkey told the king that it was better that all his men entered the lake at the same time at dawn. But the monkey told the king, \u201cMy lord, you will not go with them. I will take you separately to a spot where you can get a large store of pearl necklaces.\u201d<br \/><br \/>According to the plan, all the king\u2019s men entered the lake at the same time and were killed by the monster.<br \/><br \/>When nobody came out of the water for a long time, the king became suspicious and asked the monkey about the delay in his men coming out of the lake. The monkey immediately sprang to the top of a tree and told the king:<br \/><br \/>\u201cO king, the monster inside the lake has killed all your people. You have killed my people. This is my reply to that treachery.\u201d<br \/><br \/>Suvarnasiddhi concluded the story by repeating the earlier verse:<br \/><br \/><blockquote>\u201cHe who is overwhelmed by greed<br \/>And doesn\u2019t weigh its consequences,<br \/>Will become a victim of deceit<br \/>Like King Chandra in this story.\u201d<\/blockquote><br \/><br \/>Suvarnasiddhi then asked Chakradhara for permission to leave. Chakradhara said that it was not good to desert a friend in distress.<br \/><br \/>Suvarnasiddhi said, \u201cWhat you say is true. Yet, it is always better to do according to what the wise men advise. Otherwise, I will have to repent later like you.

He asked her not to be afraid.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>Knowing that he was determined to go, the mother went to the well in the backyard and took out a crab and asked his son to keep the crab with him during his trip.

That being summer, the day was very hot and the Brahmin halted and took rest under a big tree.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>From the hollow of the tree, a snake emerged and, attracted by the fragrance of camphor, swallowed the box containing the crab. The crab came out of the box and sliced the head of the snake and killed him. The Brahmin boy woke and found the dead snake and the camphor box. When he saw the crab coming out of the box alive, he at once realized what had happened.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>He then remembered the words of his mother and thought he did well by heeding her advice that saved him from death.
