Valmiki unintentionally utters a poem, which is rich in grammar and new in metre, of which he is very much confused as to why such a poem has come from his tongue.

1-10-12,"Those women are in most desirable form and hitherto he has not seen such forms in that forest, hence a kind of friendship spouted, with which he is inclined to detail about his father... [1-10-13]"
1-10-13,"My father is Sage Vibhandaka and I am his true descent son. I am known as Rishyasringa, by my name and by an event on my birth, and thus renowned on earth..."
1-10-14,"Our hermitage is here only, oh, august ones, I wish to perform scripturally worship to you all verily there... thus said the sage to the courtesans. [1-10-15]"
1-10-15,"On hearing the words of sage&#39;s son, all those courtesans are verily inclined to see the threshold of that hermitage, then all the women went to hermitage. [1-10-16]"
1-10-16,"On going there, then the Sage&#39;s son performed worship saying Here is our hand-wash, here is our feet-wash, here are our tuber fruits, here are the juicy fruits of ours...  [1-10-17]"
1-10-17,"All of them have received that kind of worship much enthusiastically, but dread at the arrival of the sage Vibhandaka, they quickly made-up their mind to make away from there. [1-10-18]"

1-10-19,"Then all of the courtesans have embraced him and all of them with a kind of mirthfulness in the offing, presented sweet-balls and other varieties of best sweetmeats to him. [1-10-20]"
1-10-20,"Having relished the sweets, that resplendent sage supposed them to be fruits only, for he did not taste sweets earlier, as he is always forest-bound. [1-10-21]"
1-10-21,"Taking leave of the Sage Rishyasringa on pretence that they also have to perform devotional duties, they the courtesans departed from there on the pretext of their daily worship, while they actually feared for the arrival of Rishyasringa&#39;s father who may hurl curses on his arrival...

1-10-22,"After the departure of all them the courtesans, that Brahman Rishyasringa, the grandson of Sage Kaashyapa, is disturbed at heart and even behaved sadly... [1-10-23]"
1-10-23,"Then on the next day Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandaka and the prosperous sage with ascetic power has arrived at that place where he saw well-decorated and delightful courtesans recollecting in mind repetitively about them alone. [1-10-24, 25a]"
1-10-24," Then on seeing the arrival of that Brahman, the courtesans felt happy at heart, and all of those courtesans on surrounding him said, oh, gentle one, welcome to the threshold of our hermitage... [1-10-25b, 26]"
1-10-25,"There are excellent tuber fruits and fruits and there will be a very distinctive hospitality... definitely indeed... So said the courtesans.[1-10-27]"
1-10-26,"On hearing the heart-pleasing words of all those courtesans, Rishyasringa made up his mind to go over there, and then those women took him away [to their place in Anga Kingdom.] [1-10-28]"
1-10-27,"While that great soul ad Brahman Rishyasringa while being brought into Anga Kingdom, then the Rain-god quickly showered rain in Anga kingdom to the delight of the world. [1-10-29]"
1-10-28,"The king Romapada personally proceeded towards that Brahman Rishyasring who is now entering Anga kingdom along with rains, made prostratiion before him, offered water customarily with dedication, and then the king Romapada besought beneficence of the best sage Rishyasringa to save him and his kingdom from the fury of his father Sage Vibhandaka, if sage Vibhandaka were to know about this pursuit of bringing Rishyasringa to Anga country, at a later time ...

1-11-11," Oh, great king the tigerly-man, he that Sage Rishyasringa be led here on your proceeding in person with staff and transport and on adoring him well personally. Thus Sumantra concluded his narration. [1-11-12]"
1-11-12,"On hearing the word of advise from charioteer, Dasharatha became gladsome and made Sumantra to reiterate to that sage also, for his approval, then Dasharatha travelled to the place where that Brahman Rishyasringa is, along with the inmates of palace-chambers and ministers too. [1-11-13, 14a]"
1-11-13,"On crossing over the rivers and forests slowly and steadily Dasharatha entered that kingdom where that eminent Brahman is there. [1-11-14b, 15a]"

1-11-18,"Oh, lord of subjects, your daughter Princess Shanta may go over my city Ayodhya along with her husband Rishyasringa, as oh, king, I am contemplating to perform a great Vedic ritual, indeed. So said Dasharatha to Romapada. [1-11-19b, 20a]"
1-11-19,"So it shall be said king Romapada agreeing to their travel with king Dasharatha, and addressed these words to that Brahman sage and his son-in-law, Sage Rishyasringa You may proceed along with your wife. [1-11-20b, 21a]"
1-11-20,"Then Rishyasringa agreed and replied to the king Romapada So it will be done and then having been permitted by the king he set forth along with his wife. [1-11-21b, 22a]"
1-11-21,"Those valiant kings greeted each other with thanksgiving palm-fold, and in friendship they embraced each other and gladdened. [1-11-22b, 23a]"
1-11-22,"Then king Dasharatha who set forth to Ayodhya bade farewell to his friend king Romapada, and he firstly sent quick-footed messengers to Ayodhya to inform his citizens about his arrival along with Sage Rishyasringa. [1-11-23b, 24a]"
1-11-23,"Let the entire city of Ayodhya be well decorated very quickly, let her streets be sprinkled with water and then swept, let the flags of welcome be hoisted.. Thus, king Dasharatha ordered messengers that are sent beforehand. [1-11-24b, 25a]"

1-11-26,"Then all the citizens are very happy on seeing that Brahman, Sage Rishyasringa, who is well honoured and being entered into the city by their king Dasharatha, as has been done once by Indra when he entered sage Kashyapa&#39;s son Vamana, the dwarfish boy and the incarnation of Vishnu, into heavens, and thus those citizens felt that their human lord Dasharatha vies with divine lord Indra. [1-11-27b, 28]"
1-11-27,"Dasharatha entered the sage into the palace chambers and worshipped him there as ordained in the scriptures, and in bringing the Sage here into his country, king Dasharatha believed that his desired is fulfilled. [1-11-28]"

1-11-29,"Shanta thus being admired by all of them, and in an exceptional manner by Dasharatha, comfortably resided there along with her husband, the Vedic scholar Rishyasringa. [1-11-31]"
1-12-1,"King Dasharatha requests the Sages to conduct the Vedic ritual for which the sages indent paraphernalia, which the ministers are ordered to supply forthwith. This chapter is almost a replication of chapter 8, excepting the inclusion of references to Sage Rishyasringa who by now is available in Ayodhya."
1-12-2,"After a lapse some time when spring season has come the king Dasharatha desired to perform the Vedic ritual. [1-12-1]"
1-12-3,"Then bowing his head before that Brahmana sage Rishyasringa whose is glow is like that of a deity, King Dasharatha verily beseeched that sage to conduct Vedic ritual on his behalf as he wished to beget progeny to maintaining his family line. [1-12-2]"
1-12-4,"Sage Rishyasringa who by now is well-honoured by the king said to the king, So it shall be, let the paraphernalia for ritual be garnered and let your ritual horse be released as a prerogative and let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River.... [1-12-3]"

[1-12-4, 5, 6a]"
1-12-6,"Then Sumantra being a quickest person went quickly and fetched all those Vedic scholars and clergymen. Then the virtuous king Dasharatha having offered due worships to all the sages and saints brought in by Sumantra, uttered these words which are with virtue and meaning, in an impressible manner.

1-12-7,"My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... hence I am thinking of performing the Vedic Horse Ritual for progeny... I wish to perform the ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and by strict observances... I wish to get my desires fulfilled through the divine influence of the Sage&#39;s son, Rishyasringa... [1-12-8, 9, 10a]"
1-12-8,"Then Splendid, splendid is this idea, said the Brahmana scholars blessing the king. Then Sage Vashishta along with all other important personalities have applauded the idea that has come out of the king&#39;s voice, and all those Vedic scholars and clerj"
1-12-9,"Because a virtuous thinking of begetting sons through Vedic ritual has come to you, you will by all means get four sons with boundless valour... let ritual paraphernalia be garnered and let your ritual-horse be released and let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River.... The Vedic seers thus blessed Dasharatha. [1-12-12, 13]"
1-12-10,"Then the king is gladdened to hear the blessing advises of the Vedic scholars, and he spoke to the other ministers of his court, with happiness derived from those good words. [1-12-14]"
1-12-11,"The king said to his executives, As advised by my Vedic teachers, let the paraphernalia for my ritual be procured... let the ritual-horse be released, guarded well by gallant men in its journey... and let religious teachers follow that horse as per tradition... let the ritual place be decided on the northern banks of Sarayu River... let the peace invocations be prevailing and prospering throughout as ordained in the scriptures and tradition... all the kings on this earth would have performed this Horse Ritual, if only they can perform this without a mistake... thus, this is a great and difficult ritual... the Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults performed in the rituals whereat they can inteject themselves in to the proceedings of the ritual in order to ruin it... further, the performer of the ritual also gets ruined if there were be to be faults... that is why this ritual shall be conducted faultlessly till its conclusion, and with absolute adherence to the scriptures... since all of you assembled here are efficient ones in conducting such rituals without faults, I hope you all will organise carefully.... [1-12-15,16,17,18, 19]"
1-12-12,"In appreciation of his orders all the ministers replied the king saying it will be done accordingly... and indeed they have faultlessly carried out works as ordered. [1-12-20]"
1-12-13,"Then all the Brahmans applauded the virtuous king and who is like a Sacred Bull among the kings for his virtuous endeavour of undertaking the Vedic ritual, and with his permission all of them returned from there as they have come. [1-12-21]"
1-12-14,"On the departure of the prominent Brahmans, King Dasharatha sent off those ministers who are still available there for further orders from the king, and then he the great resplendent king has entered his own palace. [1-12-22]"
1-12-15,"The Indian yearly time-cycle is two-kind, one on northern solstice and the other southern solstice. And seasons are twelve and every two months is a season, and they are calculated by almanacs basing on the stars position every year. They roughly compare with the following Gregorian months as below:"
1-13-1,"King Dasharatha requests Sage Vashishta, the Royal Priest to commence works for the Vedic ritual. Sage Vashishta instructs all the concerned about the discipline to be observed in executing the works. Sage Vashishta also instructs the minister Sumantra to invite various kings of other countries, and those kings will be received with great hospitality. King Dasharatha along with his wives takes ritual vow and enters ritual hall."
1-13-2,"On completion of one full year another springtime arrived, and then Dasharatha a determined one to beget progeny by performing Horse Ritual entered the ritual hall. [1-13-1]"
1-13-3,"Greeting and even adoring the Sage Vashishta customarily Dasharatha said these very humble words to him. [1-13-2]"
1-13-4,"Let my ritual be performed scripturally, oh eminent Brahman, let it be conducted in such a way that no obstacle occurs even in its ancillary functions. [1-13-3]"
1-13-5,"You being my very reverent royal priest are friendly and kind-hearted to me, and you alone shall shoulder the burden of the commenced ritual in all good faith and credence. [1-13-4]"
1-13-6,"Then that reverent Brahman Vashishta said to king, Whatever that is requested or decided by you, I will see that all of them are materialised accordingly. [1-13-5]"
1-13-7,"Then Sage Vashishta then summoned and spoke to elderly Brahman scholars, and elderly architects who are all proficient and elderly experts in conducting the construction of the ritual hall etc. Then summoned are the construction supervisors, brick-makers, carpenters, earth-diggers, accountants, and sculptors. So also the actors and dancers are summoned. Thus flawless scholars in scriptures and those men who are well read in Veda-s, are called and he addressed them saying, Performance of the ritual be organised by the order of the king. Bricks in many thousands be brought quickly and royal palaces as temporary guesthouses be built for the kingly guests, with very many facilities included in them. [1-13-6,7,8,9]"
1-13-8,"Like that, for accommodating Brahmans hundreds of sanctified houses be built, well endowed and well established with very many eatables, foods, and potables. [1-13-10]"
1-13-9,"So also, accommodation is to be given for city dwellers too, in very spacious housing, and severally for the kings arriving from distant places.[1-13-11]"
1-13-10,"For horses stables, reposing stalls for elephants, like that great billets for soldiers may be built for those foreign-country dwellers arriving in here on their horses and elephants along with their soldiers. [1-13-12]"
1-13-11,"These lodgings are to be arranged with many foods and utilities for the people of this city and for others coming from distant countries, and a very grand food be given in all of them. [1-13-13]"
1-13-12,"Food is to be given dutifully treating all of them well but not just illusively, and the people of all the castes shall be well honoured as they would get their due respect, and no disrespect be shown, even when overcome by passion or anger at anyone. [1-13-14, 15a]"
1-13-13,"Exceptionally respectable are those men and architects that are preoccupied in the works of the ritual as they deserve, and those men involved in these works shall be well-treated with funds and food. [1-13-15b, 16]"
1-13-14,"Thus, as to how all this be well organised without least negligence, thus you all shall administer in all your cooperation and good spirit. Thus Sage Vashishta spoke to the organisers. [1-13-17]"
1-13-15,"Then all of them collectively replied to Sage Vashishta As desired, all the well ordered works will not be neglected in the least, and they will be done as ordered, and not the least of them will be slighted. So said the artisans to Sage Vashishta. [1-13-18, 19a]"
1-13-16,"Then on calling for Sumantra, Sage Vashishta said these words to him, Let all those kings of the earth that are righteous be invited, and let all the people from all the kingdoms, say Brahmans, Kshatriya-s, Vaisya-s, Shudra-s be invited in scores duly honouring them. So said Vashishta to Sumantra. [1-13-19b, 20, 21a]"
1-13-17,"You personally invite Janaka the king of Mithila, a valiant one and an advocate of truth, honouring his well and duly bearing in mind that he is a long-time associate of our King Dasharatha, hence I am telling you in the first instance. [1-13-21b,22]"
1-13-18,"Thus that King of Kaashi who is always a friendly, affectionate and a cordial one, indeed he shall be invited by you personally. [1-13-23]"
1-13-19,"Likewise, King of Kekaya, an elderly, very virtuous, and also the father-in-law of our Lion-King Dasharatha, you personally invite him along with his sons. [1-13-24]"
1-13-20,"Romapada, the lord of Anga kingdom and the user of great bow, let that illustrious one be invited well honoured, for he is the friend of our lion-king Dasharatha. [1-13-25]"
1-13-21,"Like that King of Kosala namely Bhanumanta, and the King of Magadha, a brave one and a profound one in all scriptural knowledge, let them be honoured well and be invited. [1-13-26]"
1-13-22,"And Praaptijna, the king of Magadha, the kind-hearted and best one among kings, be well honoured and invited. Further, taking the orders of King Dasharatha and motivated by those orders, the kings of Sindhu, Sauviira and Sauraastra kingdoms may also be invited. [1-13-27]"
1-13-23,"All of the kings of southern kingdoms be invited, and should there be any other friends and other friendly kings on the surface of the earth, they too shall be invited as early as possible with all their followers, relatives through highly illustrious envoys, of course with the orders of our king. Thus Sage Vashishta said to minister Sumantra. [1-13-28, 29]"
1-13-24,"On hearing that word of Vashishta, Sumantra expeditiously ordered devout envoys to invite all those kings to their kingdom. [1-13-30]"
1-13-25,"That virtuous Sumantra became brisk upon sage&#39;s words and personally journeyed to fetch all the rulers on the earth. [1-13-31]"
1-13-26,"All those artisans engaged in ritual works have reported Vashishta, the details of all those ritual works that are accomplished. [1-13-32]"
1-13-27,"Then, that satisfied saint and eminent Brahman Vashishta, spoke this way to all of them, nothing is to be endowed to anyone either with disrespect or deceptively, the deeds done with disrespect will kill the donor and there is no doubt about it. [1-13-33, 34a]"
1-13-28,"Then in some days and nights many kings have arrived taking precious gems with them as gifts for Dasharatha. [1-13-34b, 35a]"
1-13-29,"Then the well pleased Sage Vashishta said this to King Dasharatha the kings from distant kingdoms have arrived at your behest, oh, tigerly-man, and these best kings are well honoured by me also as per their status. [1-13-35b, 36]"
1-13-30,"All the ritual works are also completed by the well coalescent men, thus you may start towards the ritual place that is nearby, to perform your ritual. Said Sage Vashishta to King Dasharatha. [1-13-37]"
1-13-31,"All the desirable paraphernalia is arranged and made available everywhere, and it is apt of you see ritual hall that is as though built by your mere wish. [1-13-38]"
1-13-32,"Thus, on a good day while the ruling star of the day is favourable, King Dasharatha came forth towards the ritual hall according to the advice of both the sages Vashishta and Rishyasringa. [1-13-39]"
1-13-33,"Then Sage Vashishta and other eminent Brahmans keeping the Sage Rishyasringa ahead of them entered the ritual hall, to commence the ritual works thus. [1-13-40]"
1-13-34,"When all have entered the ritual hall as per canons and custom, that glorious king Dasharatha along with his wives undertook vow of ritual. [1-13-41]"
1-14-1,"The Horse Ritual of Emperor Dasharatha is started on the banks of Sarayu River. The details of the arrangements for the participants, and visitors along with some aspects of the Vedic Ritual are narrated."
1-14-2,"Then after completion of one year and on regaining the ritual horse, the Emperor Dasharatha commenced his Vedic Ritual on the northern banks of River Sarayu. [1-14-1]"
1-14-3,"Keeping Rishyasringa at the helm of affairs those eminent Brahmans commenced, <em>ashva-medha</em> , the Horse-ritual of that noble-souled Dasharatha. [1-14-2]"
1-14-4,"Those well-versed conductors of Vedic rituals called <em>ritviks</em> , have started to perform works relating to ritual as per canon and rules, and conducted them scripturally and customarily. [1-14-3]"
1-14-5,"On performing <em>pravargya</em> ritual as per scriptures, like that <em>upasada</em> ritual too, those Brahmans have customarily performed all of those other rituals incidental to the main one scripturally. [1-14-4]"
1-14-6,"Then all of those distinguished sages are contended with what they have performed by worshipping gods already summoned, they also conducted early morning <em>savana</em> ritual and its ancillaries as enjoined. [1-14-5]"
1-14-7,"The oblations addressed to Indra are well given as ordained, and the flawless king Dasharatha also crushed the Soma creeper to squeeze Soma juice, and thus the mid-day <em>savana</em> ritual has come to pass according to sequence. [1-14-6]"
1-14-8,"Like that those proficient Brahmans have also performed the third <em>savana</em> , ritual of that great-exalted soul Dasharatha according to the viewpoint of scriptures. [1-14-7]"
1-14-9,"Rishyasringa and other best scholars with their well lettered and intonated Vedic hymns have invoked Indra and other gods to that place. [1-14-8]"
1-14-10,"The <em>hotaa</em> -s, invocators, have welcomed the celestials for partaking oblations by singing <em>saama</em> Veda hymns sweetly and harmoniously, and on inviting them with Vedic hymns they have offered oblations to them. [1-14-9]"
1-14-11,"There is no unburnt oblation resulted in that fire-ritual nor even a small mishap slipped in the performance of ritual. Everything appeared canonically correct and hymn oriented. Indeed the ritual is performed in a secure way. [1-14-10]"
1-14-12,"In these days of ritual none found there to be weary or hungry, and there is no single unscholarly person, nor any Brahman without at least a hundred apprentices. [1-14-11]"
1-14-13,"Given anytime the Brahmans, servants, sages, and pilgrims are fed with food for their arrival at the place of boarding is unpredictable, and that arrival is dependent on their duties for Brahmans, and by their masters for servants, and for pilgrims that do not have a particular time of arrival or departure. [1-14-12]"
1-14-14,"Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, no satisfaction to complete the meal is attained for themselves, as the food served is that pleasant."
1-14-15,"Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, there is no satisfaction to Emperor Dasharatha, for it appeared to be too meagre a serving and a lot more is to be served. [1-14-13]"
1-14-16,"Food be given abundantly, clothing be given variously are the directives, accordingly the king&#39;s men have distributed numerously there at the ritual place. [1-14-14]"
1-14-17,"Heaps of foodstuffs are also appearing there, many of them and mountain similar, which is made available customarily, day after day. [1-14-15]"
1-14-18,"To that ritual of that great-souled Dasharatha masses of men and women have arrived from different countries, and they are all well-pleased with the sumptuous food and drink supplied. [1-14-16]"
1-14-19,"The eminent Brahmans have appreciated the food that is prepared by perfect cooking to be relishable, and it is heard as they said, oh, Raghava, blessed are you for we are satisfied... [1-14-17]"
1-14-20,"Well-decorated men have served food to Brahmans, while others who wore gem-studded and lustrous earrings have helped them. [1-14-18]"
1-14-21,"Those eminent Brahmans that are good debaters have debated many intellectual debates to defeat each other, during the gap-periods of ritual works. [1-14-19]"
1-14-22,"Day by day those expert Brahmans have performed all ritual works as encouraged by Vashishta, and others and as contained in scriptures. [1-14-20]"
1-14-23,"There is no scholar without the knowledge of the six branches of Vedas, none who is an unavowed scholar, none who heard learnt less scriptures, and none among the members of the ritual of that king Dasharatha is an inexpert in debating, thus all are scholarly Brahmans. [1-14-21]"
1-14-24,"When the time came to stake wooden ritual posts, six posts of bilwa wood, six posts of khadira wood, and further the same number of posts of parnina wood are staked. One post of sleshmaataka wood and two of devadaaru wood as stipulated are staked. Then the distance between each post is maintained at the length of extended arms. [1-14-22,23]"
1-14-25,"All of those the posts are made by the authorities on scriptures and ritual scholars, and they are gold-pleated and decorated for the purpose of elegance to that ritual. [1-14-24]"
1-14-26,"They are altogether twenty-one posts, each post is twenty-one cubits in height, and each is decoratively clothed with each cloth. [1-14-25]"
1-14-27,"Carpenters have carved all the posts well, and built them strongly with octahedral surfaces that are smoothened, and thereby they are implanted procedurally. [1-14-26]"
1-14-28,"Those posts draped in cloths and worshipped with flowers and perfumery are irradiant, and they shone forth like the constellation of Seven Sages in the sky. [1-14-27]"
1-14-29,"The bricks for Altar of Fire are well designed and made according to rules and standard measurements. The Brahmans who are experts in the architecture of laying Fire Altar, by calculating the ritual field with a one-ply rope and decide where and how the that shall be, the Altar of Fire is layered well with bricks in that ritual. [1-14-28]"
1-14-30,"That Altar of Fire of that King, the Lion, is layered by expert Brahmans in the shape of an eagle with golden wings, with its size being three folds bigger than the altars of other rituals, thus it has eighteen separators, and fire is laid on it. [1-14-29]"
1-14-31,"In that ritual animals, serpents and birds designated to such and such deities are readied according to the scriptural directives. [1-14-30]"
1-14-32,"The sages have arranged those animals that are to be there in animal sacrifices, like horse and other aquatic animals, in that ritual according to scriptures. [1-14-31]"
1-14-33,"Three hundred animals are tied to the ritual posts, along with the gemlike best ritual horse of that King Dasharatha. [1-14-32]"
1-14-34,"With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, and symbolically killed the horse with three knives. [1-14-33]"
1-14-35,"Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird. [1-14-34]"
1-14-36,"Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely <em>hotaa</em> <em>adhwaryu</em> and <em>udgaataa</em> have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and a concubine of the king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king. [1-14-35]"
1-14-37,"Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum [fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to bake as a food to the celestials. [1-14-36]"
1-14-38,"The king Dasharatha smelt the smell of smoke as per time and procedure to cleanse his own sin. [1-14-37]"
1-14-39,"Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally oblated all of them into fire. [1-14-38]"
1-14-40,"In other rituals the oblations will be offered into sacrificial fire with spoon-like sticks of plaksha tree, but in Horse-sacrifice ritual they are offered through the vetasa creeper, a rattan plant, cane. [1-14-39]"
1-14-41,"The Horse Ritual is to be performed for three days as laid down in <em>kalpasutra</em>-s, the rules governing such rituals, and by <em>braahmaNa</em>-s, the penultimate parts of Veda-s, and the one performed on the first day is called <em>chatuSToma</em> ritual. [1-14-40]"
1-14-42,"The ritual on the second day is called <em>ukthyam</em> , and the next one performed on third day is called <em>atiraatra</em>. These apart many of the preordained rituals are performed there in that ritual as envisaged in scriptures. [1-14-41]"
1-14-43,"The rituals called <em>jyothiSToma, aayuSi,</em> and <em>atiraatra</em> rituals are performed. And also rituals of great kind like <em>abhijit, vishwajit, aptoryaama</em> are performed. [1-14-42]"
1-14-44,"As the promoter of his own dynasty that king Dasharatha donated eastern side to <em>hotaa</em>, western to <em>adhvaryu</em>, and southern to <em>brahmaa</em>. And to <em>udgaataa</em> northern side is given in donation. These were the donations stipulated in that great ritual, <em>ashwamedha</em>, by the Self-Created Brahma from earlier times. [1-14-44,43]"
1-14-45,"On completing the ritual thus that best man Dasharatha justifiably donated those lands to the officiating priests, called ritwiks, to promote his dynasty. [1-14-45]"
1-14-46,"Thus on giving away the vast expanses of his kingdom he that glorious one born in Ikshvaku dynasty is gladdened, but all the officiating priests said to the king who by now is rid of his sins. [1-14-46]"
1-14-47,"You alone are capable to protect the earth in its entirety, and there is no use for us with these lands, and we are not capable to rule it, either. Thus the priests are addressing the king. [1-14-47]"
1-14-48,"We are always preoccupied with self-study and teaching of scriptures, oh, king, thus you may give us something else in barter, any modest thing.  [1-14-48]"
1-14-49,"Let best gems, gold, or cows or anything else that is available you may give us, what is the use of these vast expanses to us. So said the scholars. [1-14-49]"
1-14-50,"The king Dasharatha, the lord of people, thus requested by the scholarly Vedic Brahmans gave them millions of cows, ten of ten million gold coins, and the silver four times thereof. [1-14-50, 51a]"
1-14-51,"Then all those officiating priests collectively gave that wealth to sage Rishyasringa and to the enlightened sage Vashishta. [1-14-51b, 52a]"
1-14-52,"Then all of those Brahmans are well satisfied at heart and distributed among themselves the wealth passed on by Rishyasringa and Vashishta, and then they said, We are highly gladdened. [1-14-52a, 53a]"
1-14-53,"Then to the other Brahmans who arrived there to see the ritual, King Dasharatha sincerly donated ten million gold coins. [1-14-53b, 54a]"
1-14-54,"That descendent of Raghava dynasty gave an excellent hand ornament to someone who is an impoverished Brahman and who is beseeching. [1-14-54a, 55a]"
1-14-55,"While those Brahmans are becoming happy then that king and the patron of Brahmans venerated them dutifully with his senses fluttering with happiness. [1-14-55b, 56a]"
1-14-56,"Then that benevolent and valiant King Dasharatha prostrated on ground venerating the Brahmans, and the Brahmans too chanted various blessing hymns on that prostrating king. [1-14-56b, 57a]"
1-14-57,"Then that king is gladdened at heart for the successful achievement of the completion of that excellent ritual that removes sin and that leads to heaven as well, and that which cannot be undertaken by many of the best kings. [1-14-57b, 58a]"
1-14-58,"Thereafter king Dasharatha said to sage Rishyasringa thus, oh, sage with best vows, you alone are eligible to perform the ritual for the expansion of my dynasty. [1-14-58b, 59a]"
1-14-59,"That best Brahman Rishyasringa saying yes to the proposal, said this to king Dasharatha, oh, king, there will be four sons to you that ennoble your dynasty. [1-14-59b, c]"
1-14-60,"On hearing the sweet words of Sage Rishyasringa, he that king of kings Dasharatha went into a state of ecstasy and venerating that great soul, Rishyasringa, again said this to him. [1-14-60]"
1-15-1,"King Dasharatha commences the <em>putrakaameSTi</em> ritual aiming to beget progeny, under the aegis of Sage Rishyasringa. The celestial beings gather to receive the oblations offered in the Horse Ritual conducted by King Dasharatha. They are perturbed at the atrocities of Ravana, and request Brahma to think for a way to eliminate Ravana. Vishnu arrives there and pacifies Brahma and other celestials with an assurance that he will incarnate as human to eliminate Ravana."
1-15-2,"That intellectual sage and one proficient in Veda-s Rishyasringa contemplated for a while, and gaining indications as to which ritual is to be performed, then said the king. [1-15-1]"
1-15-3,"I will procedurally conduct the ritual contained in the preamble of <em>atharva-veda</em> with procedural hymns, called &lt;&lt;em&gt;&gt;putra kaameSTi i.e., the ritual that bestows sons, for your benefit. [1-15-2]"
1-15-4,"Then that resplendent Sage Rishyasringa commenced that <em>putrakaameSTi</em> ritual, offering oblations into sacred fire with ritual acts meticulously contained in hymns. [1-15-3]"
1-15-5,"Then the deities along with celestial beings, siddha-s, i.e., the souls that obtained salvation, and also other esteemed sages who by now are the residents of Heavens have duteously assembled in the firmament to receive their part of the oblations. [1-15-4]"
1-15-6,"Those deities who procedurally assembled there in that congregation then spoke to Brahma, the creator of worlds. [1-15-5]"
1-15-7,"Oh! God, the demon named Ravana is torturing all of us with his intrepidity, as you have blessed him, and we are unable to control him. [1-15-6]"
1-15-8,"You have given boon to him appreciating his ascesis and oh, god, with high regard to that boon of yours we are tolerating all the cruel acts of Ravana from then onwards [1-15-7]"
1-15-9,"That malevolent Ravana is tormenting all the three worlds, hating the functionary deities of cosmos, and always desires to assail Indra, the king of all the functionary deities of universe. [1-15-8]"
1-15-10,"That invincible one is further self-conceited by the boons you have accorded, and he is overbearingly torturing the sages, celestial beings like yaksha-s, gandharva-s, asura-s, and like that even the Brahmans. [1-15-9]"
1-15-11,"The Sun-god will not verily parch Ravana, the Air-god will not puff at his sides, and on seeing Ravana, the lord of the undulating waves, namely the ocean will not pulsate either. [1-15-10]"
1-15-12,"Thereby, there is a great panic for all of us from that demon with an awesome look, hence oh, god, it will be apt of you to give a thought for his elimination. [1-15-11]"
1-15-13,"When all the deities spoke to Brahma thus, he thought for a while and then said Aha! The idea to kill that evil-minded Ravana is discerned. [1-15-12]"
1-15-14,"Ravana said while seeking boon that, &#39;I shall not be killed by gandharva-s, yaksha-s, or by gods, or by other demons...&#39; and I also said &#39;so be it... [1-15-13]"
1-15-15,"That demon did not express about humans then with his disrespect to them, and evidently his death does not occur otherwise. So said Brahma to gods. [1-15-14]"
1-15-16,"On hearing Brahma explaining himself, then all those gods and great sages became adequately happy. [1-15-15]"
1-15-17,"In the meanwhile the great resplendent Vishnu, the Lord of the Universe, arrived there mounted on his Eagle-vehicle Garuda, handling conch-shell, disc, and mace in his three of four hands, clad in yellow-ochre robes, wearing golden bracelets, and while best gods eulogised him, and his arrival there is like the arrival of sun mounted on black cloud to accord the gratuitous gift called the rain. [1-15-16, 17]"
1-15-18,"Vishnu having met Brahma stood there contemplating, and then all of the gods on bowing down and offering prayers addressed Vishnu. [1-15-18]"
1-15-19,"Oh! Vishnu, desiring prosperity in all the worlds we nominate you to become the son of the ruler and lord of Ayodhya, namely Dasharatha, who is a virtuous one, renowned one and one whose resplendence equals that of the sages, and oh, Vishnu, through the wives of such a king Dasharatha, who are in similitude with the <em>hrii</em>, the virtue, <em>shrii</em>, the affluence, and <em>kiirti</em>, the glory, you have a fourfold transformation and take birth as their son. [1-15-19, 20, 21a]"
1-15-20,"Oh! Vishnu, on your taking birth as human through the wives of Dasharatha you eliminate Ravana in war, who has become exacerbating and thorny to all worlds, and who is otherwise not eliminable for gods. [1-15-21b, 22a]"
1-15-21,"He that preposterous demon Ravana with his invigorated doggedness is torturing gods along with eminent saints, gandharva-s, and siddha-s. [1-15-22b, 23a]"
1-15-22,"He that furious one with his insolence is knocking down sages from their celestial abodes, and like that he is knocking down the gandharva-s and apsara celestials too from the heavenly gardens Nandana, where they will be taking delight. [1-15-23b, 24a]"
1-15-23,"We the celestial beings like siddha-s, gandharva-s, yaksha-s along with sages have actually come for his elimination, and thereby we seek shelter in you. [1-15-24b, 25a]"
1-15-24,"Oh, enemy tormentor, oh, Vishnu, you are the ultimate recourse for all us in eliminating enemies of divinity, hence you make up your mind to take birth in human world. The gods appealed to Vishnu that way. [1-15-25b, 26a]"
1-15-25,"When the god of gods Vishnu, the supreme one among deities, one who is revered by all worlds is eulogised this way, then he spoke to all of those celestials that abide in the righteousness and that are in the assemblage, keeping the Forefather Brahma at their helm. [1-15-26a, 27]"
1-15-26,"Get rid off the fear, let safety be upon you, on eliminating that cruel and evil-minded Ravana who became dreadful to deities and sages, along with his sons, grandsons, friends, cousins and relatives, ministers and forces too in war for your welfare, I will then reside in human world ruling this earth for eleven thousand years. Thus Vishnu assured the gods. [1-15-28, 29, 30a]"
1-15-27,"On giving boon to all gods in that way the kind-hearted god Vishnu started to think about the instituting base for his birth in human world. [1-15-30b, 31a]"
1-15-28,"And then that lotus-petal-eyed one agreeing to manifest himself in fourfold way is predisposed towards Dasharatha to be his father. [1-15-31b, 32a]"
1-15-29,"Then all the groups of gods, sages, gandharva-s, with rudraa-s, and apsarasa-s, extolled Vishnu with prayers of divine exposition. [1-15-32b, c]"
1-15-30,"Oh! Vishnu, he that fiery one who is renowned for evil acts and who is the hater of Indra, that Ravana is uprising furiously with his heightened arrogance, and he has become a thorn in the side of hermits hence he is a fright to sages, afor he tortures insubordinates to the the extent of loud wailing; hence we pray you to eliminate that Ravana. [1-15-33]"
1-15-31,"On eliminating that furiously vainglorious Ravana with all his forces and with all his kinsmen neutralise the pandemonium created by him in all the worlds, and for a long time to come you get rid of your febrility, and you please return to your heavenly abode, namely your blameless and faultless Vaikuntha. [1-15-34]"
1-16-1,"Later when the Omnipresent Narayana is thus nominated by best gods, and though he knows the outcome, he gently spoke these words to gods in this way. [1-16-1]"
1-16-2,"What is the idea to eliminate that demon&#39;s chief Ravana, oh, gods, adopting which strategy I will have to eliminate that thorn in the side of sages? Thus Vishnu asked the gods. [1-16-2]"
1-16-3,"Asked thus all the gods said to that sempiternal Vishnu, on assuming a human form, eliminate Ravana in a war. [1-16-3]"
1-16-4,"Oh, destroyer of enemies, he that Ravana undertook a vehement ascesis for a long period, thereby the creator of worlds and the first born one Brahma, felt gladsome of his ascesis. [1-16-4]"
1-16-5,"Satisfied with his ascesis Brahma gave boon to that demon that he shall have no fear for his life from many kinds of beings, excepting humans, because that demon indeed slighted humans earlier at the time of bestowing boon. [1-16-5, 6a]"
1-16-6,"Thus, on getting boon from the Forefather Brahma he has become arrogant and torturing the three worlds, and he is even abducting women. As such, oh, enemy destroyer Vishnu, his elimination is envisaged through humans alone. So said gods to Vishnu. [1-16-6b, 7]"
1-16-7,"On hearing that speech of gods said that way, he that kind-hearted Vishnu then chose Dasharatha as his father in human world. [1-16-8]"
1-16-8,"During that time the great resplendent king and an enemy subduer Dasharatha is performing<font color=""#B3003A"">putrakaameSTi</font> ritual, desiring progeny as he is sonless. [1-16-9]"
1-16-9,"On taking a decision Vishnu took leave of Forefather Brahma, and vanished while he is still being extolled by gods and sages. [1-16-10]"
1-16-10,"Then, from Fire of Altar Dasharatha&#39;s ritual there emerged a greatly vigorous and energetic Divine Being with an unparalleled resplendence, called <font color=""#B3003A"">yajna-puruSa</font>. [1-16-11]"
1-16-11,"He is clad in black and red garments and his face is red and his voice resembled the drumbeat. His moustache and hairdo are soft like that of a lion&#39;s mane. [1-16-12]"
1-16-12,"And he is endowed with auspicious features and decorated with divine ornaments, in height he is like a mountain peak, and in valiance he is like an imperious tiger. [1-16-13]"
1-16-13,"That great ritual being personally brought a big golden vessel carrying it with both of his hands as if he would personally handle his own wife, which vessel is made from the molten gold and covered with a silver lid, and which appeared to be crafted out of a divine illusion, since it is dazzling like sun and glowing like the tongues of flame, and that vessel is full with the divine dessert. [1-16-14, 15]"
1-16-14,"That divine person on observing king Dasharatha said these words oh, king, you may know me as the being sent by Prajapati. [1-16-16]"
1-16-15,"There after, king Dasharatha greeted that divine being with palms adjoining and said in reply, oh, god, welcome to you, and what shall I do for you? [1-16-17]"
1-16-16,"Then again, that divine being sent by Prajapati said these words, oh, king, now you have obtained this dessert in golden vessel as you have propitiated gods. [1-16-18]"
1-16-17,"Oh, tigerly king, take this dessert prepared by divinities, this is a blessed dessert that enriches progeny and health. [1-16-19]"
1-16-18,"Oh, king, let this be consumed saying so he further said, for which purpose you have performed this ritual that childbearing will be fructified in your wives by bearing sons, hence give this among your eligible wives. So said the divine being to Dasharatha. [1-16-20]"
1-16-19,"Agreeing to that the king wholeheartedly took that god-given golden vessel full with divine food. [1-16-21]"
1-16-20,"With high ecstasy Dasharatha revered that Ritual Being, the <font color=""#B3003A"">Prajaapati- PuruSha</font> or <font color=""#B3003A"">yaj"
1-16-21,"On obtaining that dessert prepared by gods then Dasharatha is highly gladdened like a pauper obtaining unforeseen wealth. [1-16-23]"
1-16-22,"On completing his work of giving the golden vessel with dessert then that divine being who is astonishing by his form and highly glowing by his physique, disappeared then and there itself. [1-16-24]"
1-16-23,"Lit up with beams of happiness Dasharatha&#39;s palace chambers shone forth like the autumnal sky brightened with moonbeams. [1-16-25]"
1-16-24,"Then Dasharatha on entering palace chambers spoke this to queen Kausalya, Receive this dessert to beget your son. [1-16-26]"
1-16-25,"The king then gave half of the dessert to queen Kausalya, and he gave half of the half, i.e., one fourth to queen Sumitra. And to Kaikeyi he gave half of the remaining half, i.e., one eight of the dessert, with a desire to beget sons. Then thinking for a while gave the remaining, i.e., one-eighth portion again to queen Sumitra. Thus, the king distributed the dessert to his wives differently. [1-16-27, 28, 29]"
1-16-26,"On getting the dessert all of those best ladies of the king, whose hearts are exuberant with happiness, deemed it as a reward. [1-16-30]"
1-16-27,"Then on consuming dessert those best ladies of the king whose resplendence then vied with that Fire and Sun became pregnant after some time. [1-16-31]"
1-16-28,"Then on seeing his queens with confirmed pregnancies Dasharatha regained his lost heart for sons, and he is gladdened like Vishnu, who will always be gladsome when worshipped by gods, namely Indra and others, as well as by the assemblages of great souls, sages. [1-16-32]"
1-17-1,"When Vishnu attained the sonship of the great-souled king Dasharatha, then Brahma the self-created addressed all of the gods this way. [1-17-1]"
1-17-2,"Let mighty and guise changing helpmates be procreated to that truth abiding and valorous Vishnu who is the well-wisher of all of us. [1-17-2]"
1-17-3,"Let monkey-shaped progeny equalling Vishnu&#39;s valour be procreated from the physiques of prominent apsara-s and gandharva-s, from the girls of yaksha-s and pannaga-s, and also thus from the bodies of kinnaraa-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, she-riksha-s and she-monkeys, and they shall be wizards of miracles and audacious ones, in travel they shall have air&#39;s speed, bestowed with intellect they shall be the knowers of ideation, and with their divine physique they shall be ineliminable, they shall be endowed with all the assaultive aspects of all missiles, and they shall be untiring in their efforts, like you who thrive on amrita, the ambrosia, unmindful of thirst and hunger. [1-17-3, 4, 5, 6]"
1-17-4,"I have already created the eminent bear Jambavanta in earlier times, as he suddenly came forth from my yawning face. [1-17-7]"
1-17-5,"When Brahma addressed them thus, those gods have agreed to his order and accordingly started to parent sons in the resemblance of monkeys. [1-17-8]"
1-17-6,"The great-souled celestial groups, namely the sages, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, caarana-s have created valiant sons that are forest rangers. [1-17-9]"
1-17-7,"Indra procreated the lord of vanara-s, namely Vali, who by his physique is like Mt. Mahendra, and the highest humidifier among all the humidifiers, namely the Sun, procreated Sugreeva. [1-17-10]"
1-17-8,"Brihaspati, the Jupiter, gave rise to a great monkey named Tara, who is the most important one among all vanara-s, and who excels all by his intelligence. [1-17-11]"
1-17-9,"The brilliant Gandhamaadana is the son of Kubera, while the divine architect Vishvakarma procreated the great monkey called Nala. [1-17-12]"
1-17-10,"The bright son of Fire is Neela whose blaze is like that of fire and who excels other monkeys by his resplendence, renown and courage. [1-17-13]"
1-17-11,"The Ashwin twin gods whose wealth is their beautiful appearance have personally procreated two vanara-s namely Mainda and Dvivida, blessing them with beautiful appearance.[1-17-14]"
1-17-12,"The Rain-god procreated the vanara named Sushena, and Thunder-god gave rise to the great mighty Sharabha. [1-17-15]"
1-17-13,"The direct son of Air-god is the marvellous and adventurous Hanuma with an indestructible body, and one identical in the speed of lady Vinata&#39;s son, namely Garuda, the divine eagle vehicle of Vishnu, and among all monkey chiefs he is the intelligent and the indefatigable one too. [1-17-16, 17a]"
1-17-14,"Thus the gods have procreated many thousands of such valorous and guise changing monkeys who with their immeasurable strength and bravery are manifest for the elimination of the decahedral demon Ravana. [1-17-17b, 18a]"
1-17-15,"And they with their elephantine, mountainous and prodigious bodies quickly took birth in bears, monkeys, sacred langoors. [1-17-18b, 19a]"
1-17-16,"Those that are procreated have attained the shape, getup and valour of the god that has fathered them, and thus the monkey race is procreated separately and individually. [1-17-19b, 20a]"
1-17-17,"Some of the vanara-s endowed with superior valour are born to female langoors, and like that some more to female bears and kinnaraa-s. [1-17-20b, 21a]"
1-17-18,"Several of the gods, great-sages, gandharva-s, eagles, yaksha-s, and the celebrated reptiles, kimpurusha-s, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, uraga-s and caarana-s and even the prominent maidens of apsara-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, naaga, gandharva-s then gladly procreated all of the thousands of forest-ranging and valiant vanara sons from their bodies that are forest rangers. [21b, 22, 23, 24a, b]"
1-17-19,"They are endowed with guise changing faculties, with bodily might and by their pride and might are identical to lions and tigers, and they are born-free in their movement in forests. [1-17-24c, 25a]"
1-17-20,"All of them are the assaulters with stones, and all are the attackers with trees, and all have their nails and claws as their weapons, yet all are experts in missiles. [1-17-25b, 26a]"
1-17-21,"They can rock greatest mountains, rip firm rooted trees, and with their speed they can agitate the of lord of rivers, namely the ocean. [1-17-26b, 27a]"
1-17-22,"They can shatter the ground with their two feet, leap and cross over great oceans, and they can seize the clouds entering arch of heaven. [1-17-27b, 28a]"
1-17-23,"They can catch ruttish elephants that tumultuously move in forests, and just with the sound of their blare they make sky flying birds to fall. [1-17-28b, 29a]"
1-17-24,"Thus the gods and others have procreated millions of such noble souled Vaanaras as the chiefs of warriors who can change their guise at their wish. [1-17-29b, 30a]"
1-17-25,"Those vanara generals who took birth thus became the prominent generals among the principle battalions of monkeys, and they have also procreated brave monkeys on their own. [1-17-30a, 31b]"
1-17-26,"Some thousands of them stayed on the ridges of Mt. Rikshavat while others reached many kinds of other mountains and forests. [1-17-31b, 32a]"
1-17-27,"All of the monkeys stood by the brothers, namely the son of Indra Vali, and the son of sun Sugreeva, and even with the monkey generals like Nala, Neela and Hanuma et al. [1-17-32b, 33]"
1-17-28,"All of those who are well-versed in warfare and endowed with the might of divine eagle Garuda, used to thwart the pride of lions, tigers and great snakes just by their own prideful subjugation while they move about the forests. [1-17-34]"
1-17-29,"He who is adroit, extremely mighty, and highly indomitable, that Vali protected bears, langoors, and monkeys just by the strength of his arms. [1-17-35]"
1-17-30,"The earth with its mountains, forests and oceanward places is overspread with those brave ones that possess diverse physiques and peculiar indication marks of their stock. [1-17-36]"
1-17-31,"The earth is thus suffused with those mighty army generals of Vanara race whose physiques resembled the clusters of clouds and peaks of mountains, and who have emerged for the reason of helping Rama. [1-17-37]"
1-18-1,"On the competition of the horse ritual of high-souled Dasharatha, the golds having received their portion of sacrificial oblation returned to their abodes as they have come. [1-18-1]"
1-18-2,"The king completing his consecratory vows held for horse ritual, entered Ayodhya city along with the company of his queens, servants, guards and vehicles. [1-18-2]"
1-18-3,"The other kings who arrived for the ritual are delighted when befittingly honoured by the king Dasharatha, and they too returned to their countries, after suitably adoring the eminent sage Vashishta. [1-18-3]"
1-18-4,"The entourages of those kings who set forth homeward from that city are highly gladdened and shone forth in fine fettle. [1-18-4]"
1-18-5,"On the departure of visiting kings, then that fortunate king Dasharatha entered the city Ayodhya, keeping eminent Brahman priests ahead of him in the procession. [1-18-5]"
1-18-6,"Well adored by king Dasharatha sage Rishyasringa also travelled along with his wife Shanta, followed by his father-in-law King Romapada, and along with other co-travellers, namely the entourage of Romapada. [1-18-6]"
1-18-7,"On dispersing all of them king Dasharatha gratifyingly dwelled there in Ayodhya, with a satiated heart dwelling upon the birth of his sons. [1-18-7]"
1-18-8,"On completion of the ritual, six seasons have passed by; then in the twelfth month, i.e., in <em>chaitra-mAsa</em>, and on the ninth day of that <em>chaitra</em> month [April-May], when it is <em>punarvasunakShatrayukta-navamI tithi</em>, i.e., when the ruling star of that ninth day is <em>punarvasu,</em> for which Aditi is the presiding deity; and when five of the nine planets - <em>sUrya, kuja, guru, shukra, shani </em>are in<em> ucChasthAna</em>-s, namely, when those planets are in ascension in their respective houses - <em>meSha, makara, karkaTa, mIna, tula - rAshI</em>-s; and when <em>chandrayukta- guru, karkaTalagne</em> - Jupiter in conjuction with Moon is ascendant in Cancer, and when day is advancing, Queen Kausalya gave birth to a son with all the divine attributes like lotus-red eyes, lengthy arms, roseate lips, voice like drumbeat, and who took birth to delight the Ikshwaku dynasty and adored by all the worlds, and who is the greatly blessed epitome of Vishnu, namely Rama. [1-18-8, 9, 10, 11]"
1-18-9,"Twice six months had rolled a way since the great sacrifice was over and, in the first month of the New Year, on the ninth day of the bright fortnight, the Lord of the worlds chose to take human form and sent down half of His essence as the son of Kausalya (thenceforth to be known as Rama), the world-honored One, the crowning glory of the grand line of Ikshwku, and the sum of all perfections. The constellation Punarvasu, of which Aditi was the regent, was chosen to preside at his birth. The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn were in ascension in their respective houses. Aries, Capricornus, Cancer, Pisces and the Libra, Jupiter and the Moon were in conjunction ; the rising sign was Cancer. And KausalyA, shone with unparalleled effulgence, even as Aditi when she gave birth to Indra, the lord of the Shining Ones, the Vajra-wielder. - C. R. Sreeniuasa Aiyangar, 1910."
1-18-10,"Kausalya shone forth with such a son whose resplendence is unlimited, as with lady Aditi who once stood out with her son Indra, the best one among gods. [1-18-12]"
1-18-11,"Queen Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharata, one embodied with all merits, and whose truthfulness itself is his valour and who is fourth component of manifest Vishnu, namely Rama. [1-18-13]"
1-18-12,"Queen Sumitra then gave birth to two sons who are the embodied epitomes of Vishnu, namely Lakshmana, and Shatrughna, who are valiant ones and experts in all kinds of weaponry. [1-18-14]"
1-18-13,"With the dawn of sun on the next day, fair-minded Bharata is born under Pisces where <em>puSyami</em> is the star of day, later the sons of Sumitra, namely Lakshmana and Shatrughna are born under Cancer, where <em>aashleSa</em> is the star of the day, i.e., the tenth of chaitra month, [1-18-15]"

[1-18-16]"
1-18-15,"The celestial singers sang melodiously, paradisiacal dancing parties danced, divine drums drummed and heavens rained flowers, with all this there is a great festivity in Ayodhya with thronging people. [1-18-17, 18a]"
1-18-16,"Hilarity filled the streets with people stampeding them and with the flurry of actors, dancers, singers and instrumentalists, as well by other onlookers, and there on the streets widely strewn are all kinds of gems appreciating the artists. [1-18-18b, 19]"
1-18-17,"The king gave worthy gifts to eulogisers, bard singers, and panegyrists, and to Brahmans he gave funds and wealth in the form of thousands of cows. [1-18-20]"
1-18-18,"Elapsed are eleven days and the naming ceremony is performed, then Vashishta, the chief priest, named the high-souled elder one as Rama, Kaikeyi&#39;s son as Bharata, and one son of Sumitra as Lakshmana and the other as Shatrughna [1-18-21, 22]"
1-18-19,"The king feasted Brahmans, urbanites and villagers and he gifted many valuable gems to Brahmans in an unlimited way, and all the rituals of birth and ceremonies sequel to it like naming ceremony, first-food-feeding ceremony, first-hair-removal ceremony, and sacred thread ceremony are performed in respect of the princes.

1-18-21,"All the princes are scholars in Veda-s, valiant ones, all are interested in the welfare of the world, all are intellectuals and all of them possess an air of probity. [1-18-25b, 26a]"
1-18-22,"Among them the great resplendent Rama, whose valour itself is his truthfulness, is the dear one to all the world like the tranquil moon. [1-18-26b, 27a]"
1-18-23,"Rama is admittedly a champion of riding elephants and horses, also in tactical charioting, and he rejoices in the art of archery, and absorbed in the obedient service of his father. [1-18-27b, 28a]"
1-18-24,"Right from childhood Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, is always amiable towards his world-charming elder brother Rama. [1-18-28b, 29a]"
1-18-25,"Lakshmana who is endowed with the wealth of dedication dedicated himself to Rama with bodily service, and while performing all agreeable deeds in respect of Rama, he behaved like Rama&#39;s alter ego. [1-18-29b, 30a]"
1-18-26,"That best one among the men Rama does not get his sleep without Lakshmana and he would not eat food brought for him, however delicious it may be, without Lakshmana. [1-18-30b, 31a]"
1-18-27,"Whenever Raghava mounts a horse and goes on a hunting game Lakshmana rushes after him wielding his bow as a squire. [1-18-31b, 32a]"
1-18-28,"Lakshmana&#39;s younger brother Shatrughna is a dear one to Bharata, like that Bharata too held Shatrughna dearer than his own lives. [1-18-32b, 33a]"
1-18-29,"King Dasharatha is highly gladdened with four of his highly fortunate sons like the Forefather Brahma with gods in heaven. [1-18-33]"
1-18-30,"When all of the four sons are thus prospering with prudence, gifted with all the merits, self-conscious to do wrong deeds, well-known for their gentility, knowers of pros and cons and even the conscientious princes, then their father Dasharatha is contented in respect of all of them who are such radiantly brilliant and potential princes, like Brahma. [1-18-34b, 35, 36a]"
1-18-31,"Even those tigerly-men, namely the princes, are engrossed in the studies of Veda-s, delighted to render service to their father and they are also the experts in art of archery. [1-18-36b, 37a]"
1-18-32,"Then the noble souled Dasharatha contemplated along with his priestly teachers and relatives about the matrimonial alliances of his sons. [1-18-37b, 38a]"
1-18-33,"While the great souled Dasharatha is discussing the marriages of princes among his ministers, the highly powerful sage Vishvamitra arrived. [1-18-38b, 39a]"
1-18-34,"Desirous to have an audience with king Vishvamitra said to the doorkeeper, Let the king be informed quickly that I, the son of Gadhi from the dynasty of Kushi, have come [1-18-39b, 40a]"
1-18-35,"On listening those words all the doorkeepers are dumbfounded, and ushered by those words they quickly rushed to the place of Dasharatha. [1-18-40b, 41a]"
1-18-36,"Then on their arriving at the king&#39;s palace the doorkeepers have announced to the king of Ikshvaku-s, namely Dasharatha, about the arrival of sage Vishvamitra. [1-18-41b, 42a]"
1-18-37,"On hearing that message from doorkeepers Dasharatha is highly pleased and he has gone towards Vishvamitra in a self-possessed manner along with royal priests, as Indra would ceremoniously go towards Brahma. [1-18-42b, 43a]"
1-18-38,"Then on seeing the resplendent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance is by his own ascesis and who has severe self-discipline, the king offered water with a gladsome aspect, as first customary hospitality in receiving unexpected guest. [1-18-43b, 44a]"
1-18-39,"On receiving water from the king scripturally and customarily Vishvamitra enquired after the well-being and welfare of king Dasharatha. [1-18-44b, 45a]"
1-18-40,"That highly righteous sage Vishvamitra asked the king after the well-being of city, exchequer, rural areas, friends and relatives. [1-18-45b, 46a]"
1-18-41,"Sage Vishvamitra asked Dasharatha, Are all of the provincial kings acquiescent to you, and all your enemies conquered? Are you properly performing the devotional and social works? [1-18-46b, 47a]"
1-18-42,"And on meeting the eminent sage Vashishta and with them the other exalted sages according to custom Vishvamitra asked after their well-being. [1-18-47b, 48a]"
1-18-43,"Then adoringly invited by the king Dasharatha all of them gladly entered the palace and they took their seats according to protocol. [1-18-48b, 49a]"
1-18-44,"Then the very generous king Dasharatha is gladdened at heart at the arrival of Vishvamitra, and he spoke this way feeling happy to adore that sage. [1-18-49b, 50a]"
1-18-45,"I deem your arrival is in the vein of mortals attaining ambrosia, rainfall in a droughty land, a barren father begetting a son through his deserving wife, a regain of long lost treasures, and the gladness at a great happening, oh, great saint, welcome to you. [1-18-50b, 51, 52a]"
1-18-46,"Oh, Brahman, as I am the one who is delighted for your arrival, and as you are the most eligible recipient from me, what is that choicest object of yours to be fulfilled by me, and in which way. Oh, endower of respect, for me your arrival is fortunate whereby my birth is fructified and my life flourished today, and wherefore I could see a great Brahman like you visiting my home, therefore the sun appears to have dawned in my night. [1-18-52b, 53, 54a]"
1-18-47,"Originally your glory was explicit by your title kingly-sage, and subsequently you attained the Absolute-sainthood by your ascesis, and you are venerable to me, in many ways. [1-18-54b, 55a]"
1-18-48,"Oh, Brahman, thereby your arrival at my place is surprising and ideally sacred to me, and by your very appearance I have become one who has gone on a quiet pilgrimage. [1-18-55b, 56a]"
1-18-49,"You may tell me, entreating which work your arrival chanced here and I feel that I am indeed blessed and wish to make it happen to achieve results. [1-18-56b, 57a]"
1-18-50,"It is unapt of you to deliberate about the feasibility of the work, oh, sage with blest vows, while I am the fulfiller of it without any reminder, since you are god to me, indeed. [1-18-57b, 58a]"
1-18-51,"Oh, Brahman, this is the great prosperity that bechanced on me, and this is propriety in its entirety that bechanced on me, as a result of your arrival. [1-18-58b, c]"
1-18-52,"On hearing the words of high-minded Dasharatha, said that way in all his humbleness, and those that are pleasant to ears as well to heart, he who is a renowned for his personal attributes and a reputed one by his exceptional qualities, that sublime sage Vishvamitra obtained high rejoice. [1-18-59]"
1-19-1,"On listening the grand and detailed sentences of that King the lion Dasharatha, the great resplendent Sage Vishvamitra is thrilled with happiness and spoke this way. [1-19-1]"
1-19-2,"Oh, tigerly king, to you befitting are these words and to none else, as you are born in a great dynasty and tutored by Vashishta. [1-19-2]"
1-19-3,"What concerns I have in my heart I am going to say, and you take decision thereof, oh, tigerly-king, and become truthful to your promises. [1-19-3]"
1-19-4,"These days I am abiding by a sacrificial vow to attain a spiritual goal but, oh, best one among men, two guise changing demons as causing obstacles to that ritual. [1-19-4]"
1-19-5,"At the near end of almost completed ritual of mine two valiant and well-trained demons, namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are drenching the Altar of Fire with streams of meat and blood. [1-19-5, 6a]"
1-19-6,"When the ritual vow is thus ravaged I, as the one who exerted myself for the ritual, had to depart from that place, unenthusiastically. [1-19-6n, 7a]"
1-19-7,"And to me there is no will to let loose my anger, oh, king, as no curse shall be issued under vows, and like that the activity during rituals shall be inoffensive, isn&#39;t it. [1-19-7b, 8a]"
1-19-8,"As such, oh, tigerly king, it will be apt of you spare the services of that brave one whose valour itself is his truthfulness, that youngling whose hair locks are all the more jet black like crow wings on either side of his head, spare that eldest son of yours, namely Rama. [1-19-8b, 9a]"
1-19-9,"Indeed, he is capable to eradicate those demons that are thwarting the ritual by his own divine resplendence, and protected by me as well. [1-19-9b, 10a]"
1-19-10,"I will also accord many kinds of benefits to him by which he acquires renown in all the three worlds, no doubt about it. [1-19-10b, 11a]"
1-19-11,"Those two demons will be rendered incapable to stand fast on affronting Rama in anywise, and none other than Raghava has the fortitude to eliminate those two. [1-19-11b, 12a]"
1-19-12,"Those two sinners that are berserk by their vigour have gone into the subjection of death&#39;s noose, oh tigerly king, cannot counterbalance the great-souled Rama. [1-19-12b, 13a]"
1-19-13,"It will be unapt of you to show your paternal fondness, oh, king, upon my oath, be assured that those two demons are eradicated. [1-19-13b, 14a]"
1-19-14,"I am sensible of that sublime-soul Rama, whose valour is his truthfulness, and even this great resplendent Vashishta and these saints that are here are aware. [1-19-14b, 15a]"
1-19-15,"If you wish to gain in value of probity, a long-lasting and paramount renown on earth it will be apt of you to handover Rama to me. [1-19-15b, 16a]"
1-19-16,"Oh, Dasharatha, you may send Rama if only your ministers and all the other elite headed by Vashishta are going to give assent. [1-19-16b, 17a]"
1-19-17,"It will be apt of you to send your choicest son, the lotus-eyed Rama, just for ten days of the ritual without temporising. [1-19-17b, 18a]"
1-19-18,"I wish you to take decision as to how my ritual&#39;s time is not lapsed, and let safety betide you, let not your heart be rendered to grieve. Thus Vishvamitra said to Dasharatha. [1-19-18b, 19a]"
1-19-19,"On saying those words that comprise fairness and meaningfulness that virtue-souled great saint with great resplendence paused. [1-19-19b, 20a]"
1-19-20,"On hearing the propitious words of sage Vishvamitra that best king Dasharatha shuddered and swooned as he is muffled up with profound adversity, and after that on regaining consciousness he sunk down in fear. [1-19-20b, 21]"
1-19-21,"This way on hearing that word of the saint Vishvamitra which is explicitly slitting his mind and heart that illustrious and noble-souled king Dasharatha then became highly annoyed at heart, and flustered extremely in his throne. [1-19-22]"
1-20-1,"On hearing what is spoken by Vishvamitra the tigerly-king Dasharatha became insensate for a time, and on redeeming senses he said this. [1-20-1]"
1-20-2,"Less than sixteen years of age is my lotus-eyed Rama, and I see no warring aptitude to him with the demons. [1-20-2]"
1-20-3,"Here is the full-fledged battalion, called <font color=""#B3003A"">akShouhiNii senaa</font> , for which I am the leader and controller, and fortified by this army I will go there to encounter those demons. [1-20-3]"
1-20-4,"Brave and daring are these soldiers of mine, and as experts in weaponry they are the appropriate ones to combat the hordes of demons, but, it will be ungentle of you to take Rama with you. [1-20-4]"
1-20-5,"I alone with bow in my hand can protect your ritual, and as long as I bear my lives so long I war with those nightwalkers staying in the van of war. [1-20-5]"
1-20-6," I myself wish to come over there thereby the works of ritual will be well-guarded and unimpeded, but, taking Rama with you will be ungracious of you. [1-20-6]"
1-20-7,"Why because, Rama is boy! And he is unschooled in his princely education; does he know the strengths and weaknesses of opponents - no; has he got the equipage of arsenal - no; has he any expertise in warfare - no; is he an equal to the demons - no; be that as it may, those demons definitely conduct a deceitful warfare, isn&#39;t it. [1-19-7, 8a]"
1-20-8,"Alienated from Rama I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, tigerly sage, hence taking Rama with you will be unjust. [1-20-8b, 9a]"
1-20-9,"Otherwise, oh, Brahman with best vows, if you so wish to take Rama along with you, you lead him off along with me, and along with my four kinds of troops. [1-20-9b, 10a]"
1-20-10,"Sixty thousand years have passed from my birth, oh! Vishvamitra, and this Rama is engendered at this age, that too with tribulations, hence taking Rama with you will be inappropriate of you. [1-20-10b, 11a]"
1-20-11,"I will have exceptional affection for all of my four sons, isn&#39;t it, and among them Rama has a significance in the matter of his descent as an eldest son, hence taking Rama with you will be unjust of you. [1-20-11b, 12a]"
1-20-12,"Oh, eminent sage, of what fortitude are those demons? Whose sons are they? Who are they? How is their size and shape? Also who protects all of them? [1-20-12b, 13a]"
1-20-13,"Oh, Brahman, how Rama, or my forces, or I myself have to retaliate those demons that are deceitful militants. [1-20-13b, 14a]"
1-20-14,"Tell me all that, oh, god, how I have to carry on when warring with those evil minded demons, for the demons will be delirious by their audacity, isn&#39;t it... Thus Dasharatha asked Vishvamitra insistently. On hearing those words Sage Vishvamitra replied this way. [1-20-14b, 15]"
1-20-15,"One born in Paulastya dynasty, an extremely mighty and exceedingly brave demon named Ravana is there, and he with the boon given by Brahma, and accompanied with many other demons is torturing the triad of worlds, contemptuously. [1-20-16, 17a]"
1-20-16,"Unequivocally that chief of demons is the brother of Kubera and the son of sage Vishravasa, thus we hear. [1-20-17b, 18a]"
1-20-17,"That formidable Ravana is not a devastator of rituals by himself, even so, two very mighty demons called Mareecha and Subaahu will cause devastating hindrances to rituals, instigated by him. Thus Sage Vishvamitra said to Dasharatha. [1-20-18b, 19]"
1-20-18,"Thus when he is said so by that sage Vishvamitra, then the king Dasharatha spoke to the sage, I myself am not capable of standing against that evil minded Ravana, in truth, where is the question of deputing my young Rama to confront him? [1-20-20]"
1-20-19,"You are the knower of probity, such as you are, you may please bestow benevolence upon my boyish son, as well on a less fortunate one like me too, and as our mentor you are indeed a god of ours. [1-20-21]"
1-20-20,"Gods, demons, celestial beings like gandharva-s, yaksha-s, winged and reptile beings are incapable to bear the brunt of that Ravana in fight, why tell again about humans. [1-20-22]"
1-20-21,"But that Ravana depletes the valour of valorous opponents in a battle, oh, eminent sage, either with my entire forces, or with all my sons I am inadequate to grapple with all his forces, or with him, individually. [1-20-23, 24a]"
1-20-22,"My boyish son is godlike and unfledged in warfare, oh, Brahman, and he is the one who alleviates me from <font color=""#B3003A"">punnama naraka</font> the hell of sonless fathers... no, I cannot spare my son in anyway. [1-20-24b, 25a]"
1-20-23,"Further, those saboteurs of your ritual namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are similar to Death-god and the descendents of the earliest demons and subverters of rituals, namely Sunda and Upasunda, no, I cannot spare my son, in any case. [1-20-25b, 26a]"
1-20-24,"Mareecha and Subaahu are well-trained and valorous ones, hence I will proceed with all my friendly forces to war with either of those two demons, otherwise, I along with all my relatives implore upon you for your exoneration in my failure to comply my own promises. [1-20-26b, 27]"
1-20-25,"Thus, by the incongruous talk of Dasharatha, the outstanding Brahman and son of Sage Kushi, namely sage Vishvamitra is overwhelmed with outrageous anger by his mentation, and that fire-like glorious sage looked like the ritual fire into which many inflammable oblations are offered, and which is drenched with a lot of clarified butter, whereby it is flaring up its tongues. [1-20-28]"
1-21-1,"On hearing the wavery words of Dasharatha that are full of fond for his son, Vishvamitra wrathfully replied this sentence to the king. [1-21-1]"
1-21-2,"On promising me to fulfil my object in the first instance you wish to repudiate it now, undeserving is this kind of deviation for the kings of Raghava dynasty. [1-21-2]"
1-21-3,"If this is worth while to you, oh, king, I wish to go away as I have come, and you with your feigned promises be nonchalantly happy with your kinsmen. So said Vishvamitra to the king. [1-21-3]"
1-21-4,"When that prudent sage Vishvamitra is thus enwrapped in fury, then the whole earth trembled and the gods are scared. [1-21-4]"
1-21-5,"On knowing the appalled appearance of the entire world at the fury of Vishvamitra, Vashishta the great sage with high vows and an insightful one too, said these words to the king. [1-21-5]"
1-21-6,"Born in Ikshwaku dynasty you are apparently the other god of ethics on earth, a staunch one with righteous vows and a glorious one too, such as you are, it will be unapt of you to forsake ethics. [1-21-6]"
1-21-7,"In three worlds you are renowned as the right-minded one, oh, Raghava, hence adhere to your own uprightness, and adhering to unrighteousness will be unapt of you. [1-21-7]"
1-21-8,"Promising to effectuate something in any way and not effectuating the given word results in the perdition to the merits of <font color="" #B3003A"">iSTaapuurta</font> Vedic rituals, hence oh, Raghava, leave hold of Rama. [1-21-8]"
1-21-9,"Whether Rama is trained in weaponry or not, demons cannot trounce Rama as long as Kushi&#39;s son Vishvamitra protects him, like the heavenly firewall that protects divine nectar. [1-21-9]"
1-21-10,"He is an embodiment of virtue, matchless among the venturesome, peerless in intellect among all in the world, and flawless in ascesis. [1-21-10]"
1-21-11,"He is in the know-how of various missiles, and no other person is there in the triad of worlds, inclusive of sessile and mobile worlds, who is knowledgeable about him, or someone who can know him will be there in future, excepting myself. [1-21-11]"
1-21-12,"While Gods cannot know Vishvamitra, can anybody from sages - no; immortals- no; demons - no; the gandharva-s and eminent yaksha-s together with the kinnaraa-s and great reptile beings - no, they cannot know him. [1-21-12]"
1-21-13,"All the missiles known to Vishvamitra are the highly righteous children of Krishaashva Prajapati, where Prajapati-s were the earliest ruler of mankind, and god Shiva gave them to Vishvamitra when was ruling kingdom. [1-21-13]"
1-21-14,"Those missiles are the sons of Daksha Prajaapati&#39;s daughters and her husband Krishaasva Prajapati, and they are disparate in their form, intrepid, dazzling, and victory-oriented missiles. [1-21-14]"
1-21-15,"Jaya and Suprabha, the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, endowed with best waists gave birth to a hundred missiles and weaponry whose flare is supreme. [1-21-15]"
1-21-16,"On getting a boon Jaya named wife of Krishaasva Prajapati is benefited with fifty best and formless sons with immeasurable fortitude for the destruction of ungodly beings. [1-21-16]"
1-21-17,"Suprabha, another wife of Krishaasva Prajapati, gave birth to another fifty unassailable, unconquerable and mighty sons named the Eliminators. [1-21-17]"
1-21-18,"And this sage Vishvamitra is in the precise know of the said missiles, and this principled one is also capable of creating hitherto unavailable missiles. [1-21-18]"
1-21-19,"Thereby, oh, Raghava, nothing whatsoever is unknown to this great-souled Vishvamitra, who is a distinguished sage and the knower of virtue, either that has happened or that is happening. [1-21-19]"
1-21-20,"Thus, the highly renowned and great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has this sort of enterprise, oh, king, allowing a doubt enter your mind in Rama&#39;s accompanying the sage will be unapt of you. [1-21-20]"
1-21-21,"This son of Kushi, Vishvamitra, can as well control those demons by himself, but intending to accord beneficence to your son he approached you and imploring upon you. [1-21-21]"
1-21-22,"Thus the prominent king from Raghu dynasty, namely Dasharatha, became serene-minded by sage Vashishta&#39;s words, and he who is supreme among other kings and who has pronounced renown, that Dasharatha then gladly and wholeheartedly consented to the travel of Rama along with the sage Vishvamitra. [1-21-22]"
1-22-1,"When Vashishta said that way king Dasharatha with an air of satisfaction personally fetched Rama along with Lakshmana. [1-22-1]"
1-22-2,"Rama is blessed for a propitious travel firstly by his mother Kausalya and then by his father king Dasharatha, thereupon the royal priest Vashishta rendered Vedic hymns blessing the journey, then Dasharatha well pleased in his heart of hearts kissed his son Rama on forehead and entrusted him to Vishvamitra. [1-22-2, 3]"
1-22-3,"Then on seeing the lotus-eyed Rama following Vishvamitra, dustless and pleasant for touch breeze blew. [1-22-4]"
1-22-4,"When the great-souled Rama forged ahead there occurred an abounding downpour of flowers with the booming of divine drums, together with the boom and blare of drums and conch-shells of Ayodhya. [1-22-5]"
1-22-5,"Rama with jet-black hair-locks handling his bow followed Vishvamitra who walked ahead, while Lakshmana handling his own bow followed Rama. [1-22-6]"
1-22-6,"Rama and Lakshmana, with two quivers each and two bows in their hands, and making all the ten directions of compass lambent followed Vishvamitra, as if three headed serpents followed Vishvamitra, and with their highly dynamic physiques and spiritedness they look as if like the Ashwin twin gods of unequal charm following Brahma, the Forefather. [1-22-7]"
1-22-7,"Those two youngsters with charming and bejewelled physiques are handling bows and swords and their fingers have leathern covers. Both the unreprovable brothers Rama and Lakshmana are highly resplendent and effulgent by their worth. While they are following Vishvamitra they looked like the sons of Fire-god, namely Skanda and Vishakha, following the great god with inscrutable potential, namely Shiva, and thus the brothers have made Vishvamitra to shine forth in even pose with god Shiva. [1-22-8, 9, 10a]"
1-22-8,"And on going one and half yojana distance Vishvamitra addressed Rama in a harmonious voice calling, &#39;oh, Rama&#39;, on the southern riverbank of Sarayu. [1-22-10b, 11a]"
1-22-9," Take water, my boy, and like that you receive a group of hymns,<font color=""#B3003A"">bala</font> and <font color=""#B3003A"">atibala</font> from me, and let no time lapse. [1-22-11b, 12a]"
1-22-10,"On receiving these hymns neither tiredness nor fever, nor disfiguring of personality can effect you, nor the demons can charge you either you are sleeping or unvigilant. [1-11-12b, 13a]"
1-22-11,"As it is none whosoever on earth can equal you in dexterity, Rama, and by reciting these hymns none can equal you in the three worlds. [1-22-13b, 14a]"
1-22-12,"My dear Raghava, if bala atibala hymns are practised, oh, impeccable one, none can equal you in the world by your handsomeness, calibre, erudition, by your discernment, and even in replying or rebutting you. [1-22-14b, 15]"
1-22-13,"On receiving these two teachings there will be none similar to you, for bala and atibala are the mothers of all knowledge. [1-22-16]"
1-22-14,"Oh, best one among men, Raghava, if you go on reciting bala and atiblala hymns, my dear Rama, there will be no hunger or thirst to you. [1-22-17]"
1-22-15,"And if these twin teachings are practised an inestimable renown will also accrue, oh, Raghu&#39;s legatee, these two hymns that possess brilliance are the daughters of Forefather Brahma, and oh, Rama of Kakutstha, I intend to impart these hymns to you, oh virtuous one, as you are the most eligible one, hence take the teachings that are kept safe from the world. [1-22-18, 19a]"
1-22-16,"Though all of these numerous qualities are undoubtedly available with you, that too in abundance, yet these hymns if ascetically nurtured will yield various results. Thus spoke Sage Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-22-19b, 20a]"
1-22-17,"Then Rama on touching water to purify himself received those teachings from the contemplative soul Vishvamitra with gladness beaming on his face. [1-22-20b, 21a]"
1-22-18,"Rama, the one with marvellous valiance, on obtaining those teachings performed all his duties of a student in respect of a teacher and then shone forth like the thousand rayed sun on a cloudless sky of autumn. Then those three very happily stayed on the riverbank of Sarayu for that night. [1-22-21b, 22]"
1-22-19,"Though both Rama and Lakshmana slept on an undeserving grass bed, nestled by the comfortable words of Vishvamitra that night is as though pleasant to the noteworthy children of Dasharatha. [1-22-24]"
1-22-20,"Sage Vishvamitra is the Seer for Gayatri hymn. He is the same Sage to impart <em>balaatibala</em> hymns to Rama and Lakshmana. For those readers that are interested to know or to practice, the Upanishad of <em>balaatibala</em> is included hereunder. This hymn is yet another aspect of Gayatri, and there is no hymn superior than Gayatri, <em>na gaayatryaaH paramam japam</em>"
1-23-1,"At dawn after that night the great saint Vishvamitra spoke to the legatees of Kakutstha, Rama and Lakshmana, those that are sleeping on a grass bed. [1-23-1]"
1-23-2,"Fortunate is Kausalya to beget you as her son Rama... get up oh, tigerly-man, eastern aurora is emerging, daytime tasks towards gods are to be performed. [1-23-2]"
1-23-3,"On hearing the benign words of the sage those valorous and best ones among men got up, bathed, and on offering water oblation they meditated upon the supreme hymn, namely Gayatri. [1-23-3]"
1-23-4,"On performing their dawn time duties those two stalwarts, Rama and Lakshmana, enthusiastically presented themselves before the ascetically rich sage Vishvamitra for further journey, duly venerating him. [1-23-4]"
1-23-5,"Then on travelling some more distance those two great valiant ones, there they have seen the divine river that courses in three ways, namely Ganga, at the auspicious confluence of River Sarayu. [1-23-5]"
1-23-6,"There they have seen the merited hermitage of sages with contemplative souls, and who are practising supreme ascesis for many thousand years. [1-23-6]"
1-23-7,"On seeing that merited hermitage Rama and Lakshmana are highly pleased and said this word to that great-soul Sage Vishvamitra. [1-23-7]"
1-23-8,"Whose hermitage is this merited one? Indeed who is the celebrity that lives therein? Oh, godly sage, we are interested to listen, and we are truly inquisitive about it. Thus they asked. [1-23-8]"
1-23-9,"On hearing their words the eminent sage Viswamitra said smilingly,  whose hermitage is this in earlier times that may be listened. Thus Vishvamitra started to narrate. [1-23-9]"
1-23-10,"When Love-god was with his body wise men used to call him Kama, the passion. At this place, that Love-god with his naughty intent braved god of gods Shiva who had been practising ascesis and who concentrated observantly, and who was returning after his marriage along with his followers, namely the Wind-gods, and that great soul Shiva disapprovingly roared at Love-god. [1-23-10, 11]"
1-23-11,"And Rama, the wrathful third-eye of Shiva destroyed the lewd-minded Love-god making all his limbs to fall down from his body. [1-23-12]"
1-23-12,"There the body of Love-god is evanesced when that great soul Shiva burnt it down, and by the anger of that god of gods Shiva, Love-god is rendered as a bodiless entity. [1-23-13]"
1-23-13,"Then onwards Love-god is renowned as Ananga, as he is without body, and where his body is given up that is renowned as Anga province. [1-23-14]"
1-23-14,"This merited hermitage thus belongs to Shiva and, oh, brave Rama, these sages abiding in virtue are Shiva&#39;s disciples at one time, thus sin is unverifiable with them. [1-23-15]"
1-23-15,"Let us stay for this night in this hermitage situated in between two meritorious rivers Ganga and Sarayu, oh, Rama with auspicious mien, tomorrow we will cross over the River Ganga. [1-23-16]"
1-23-16,"Let us all purify ourselves by taking our bath, performing our meditations, offering our daily oblations, and then let us enter this meritorious hermitage, thus our stay in here will be comforting to us. So said Vishvamitra to Rama and Lakshmana. [1-23-17, 18a]"
1-23-17,"When they are discussing there the sages of that hermitage are highly gladdened to perceive them with their sixth-sense, and on approaching them enchantedly they offered water for hands and feet wash and then offered hospitality firstly to Sage Vishvamitra. [1-23-18, 19]"
1-23-18,"Afterwards those sages of that hermitage have accorded reception to Rama and Lakshmana, and applauded by Vishvamitra for their hospitality those sages have entertained Rama and other guests with myths and legends. [1-23-20]"
1-23-19,"Those sages with concentrated minds and according to one&#39;s own aptitude have meditated upon the deity of sunset when it is sundown, followed by Rama and others. Then led into hermitage by those sages who are with pious commitments and who are dwelling there, Rama and others have very comfortably stayed in the precincts of Shiva&#39;s hermitage. [1-23-21]"
1-23-20,"Staying very comfortably in the precincts of Kaama hermitage, then that virtuous sage Vishvamitra, saint the eminent, delighted the delightful princes with delighting stories.....[1-23-22]"
1-24-1,"Then, in the fresh of the morning those enemy destroyers, Rama and Lakshmana, arrived at the riverbank of Ganga keeping sage Vishvamitra ahead of them, which sage has just completed his ritualistic chores of dawn. [1-24-1]"
1-24-2,"All those sages of Kaama&#39;s hermitage that are the great souls and scrupulous ones in their vows, have positioned an auspicious ferryboat within the reach in the river, and then they said to sage Vishvamitra. [1-24-2]"
1-24-3,"You may board the boat keeping the princes ahead of you, and we wish you to proceed on a prosperous route without the shift of time. So said the sages. [1-24-3]"
1-24-4,"Sage Vishvamitra on saying &#39;it must be so,&#39; to those sages and revering them in his turn, cruised the river that itself is cruising towards ocean, along with both the princes. [1-24-4]"
1-24-5,"On coming to the midstream of water there Rama heard an unusual and increasing noise of gushy waters along with his younger brother, and that brilliant one Rama desired to know its significance. [1-24-5, 6a]"
1-24-6,"Rama then asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra in the midst of the river, what is this turbulent sound sire, as though slashing water? [1-24-6b, 7a]"
1-24-7,"On hearing the inquisitive words of Raghava that virtue-souled sage Vishvamitra started to tell the significance of that sound. [1-24-7b, 8a]"
1-24-8,"On Mt. Kailash Brahma created a great lake at his will, oh, tigerly-man Rama, hence that is called Maanasa Lake. [1-24-8b, 9a]"
1-24-9,"That river which spontaneously flows out of that Maanasa Lake surrounds Ayodhya city is this one, the River Sarayu. Because this has originated from a lake, <font color=""#B3003A"">saraH</font>, this is known as Sarayu. And because it flows from Brahma&#39;s Lake it is a merited river. This is the remarkable noise of such a Sarayu River in its coursing towards River Ganga, generated by the collision of their waters, and Rama, offer regards to these rivers, respectfully. So said Vishvamitra to the princes. [1-24-9b, 10, 11a]"
1-24-10,"Offering their salutations to River Sarayu and Ganga those two most virtuous and agile footed princes proceeded further on reaching the southern riverbank. [1-24-11b, 12a]"
1-24-11,"On seeing a horrendous and uninhibited forest, Rama, the son of the best king Dasharatha asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-24-12b, 13a]"
1-24-12,"Oh, impenetrable is this forest fraught with swarms of crickets, brutish predators, and vultures, which are all horribly strident. [1-24-13b, 14a]"
1-24-13,"Various vultures are screeching with fierce sonority, and tigers, wild boars, and elephants render this forest atypical. [1-24-14b, 15a]"
1-24-14,"Indeed, what is this wretched forest that is dense with Dhava, Ashvakarna, Arjuna, Bilva, Tinduka, Patala, and Badari trees. Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-24-15b, 16a]"
1-24-15,"The resplendent and the great saint Vishvamitra then said to Rama, I will tell you, oh, my boy Rama, whose is this wretched forest. [1-24-16b, 17a]"
1-24-16,"Once these were vast provinces, oh, best one among men, designed by gods and known as Malada and Karuusha. [1-24-17b, 18a]"
1-24-17,"Once upon a time, oh, Rama, mortal impurities of filth and hunger completely stained Indra when he eliminated demon Vritra, as he committed the sin of killing of a Brahman, where the demon Vritra was incidentally a Brahman. [1-24-18b, 19a]"
1-24-18,"The gods and ascetically rich sages then started to bathe feculent Indra with their handy vessels for the riddance of his defilement. [1-24-19b, 20a]"
1-24-19,"On giving filth and hunger emerged out of the body of Mahendra here on the earth then the gods were gladdened. [1-24-20b, 21a]"
1-24-20,"As and when Indra was without desecration and hunger as well, and thus purified, then gladdened about this place he gave it an unexcelled boon. [1-24-21b, 22a]"
1-24-21,"These provinces that bear the impurity of my body shall become resourceful and they shall attain renown in world as Malada and Karusha. Thus Indra gave boon to this place. [1-24-22b, 23a]"
1-24-22,"On observing the honour accorded by wise Indra to these places gods praised the controller of demon Paaka, namely Indra saying, &#39;splendid, splendid it is.&#39; [1-24-23b, 24a]"
1-24-23,"For a long time these habitations Malada and Karuusha were affluent, oh, enemy subjugator Rama, and people were happy with wealth and provisions. [1-24-24b, 25a]"
1-24-24,"Later at sometime, a yaksha female who is a guise changer at her wish, possessor of the strength of a thousand elephants, wife of clever Sunda, and she whose son is demon Mareecha, the one equal to Indra in his bravery, prevailed here, let you be safe Rama. [1-24-25b, 26, 27a]"
1-24-25,"That demon Mareecha is round shouldered, huge headed, cavernous mouthed, and gigantic bodied one, and he is always terrifying the people. [1-24-27b, 28a]"
1-24-26,"And Raghava, that malevolent Tataka is always destroying the inhabitations at Malada and Karusha. [1-24-28b, 29a]"
1-24-27,"She lives about one and half yojana distance from here, and by which reason this became the forest of Tataka, owing to her gruesome activities, for that reason only a headway is to be made, to eradicate her and her activities. [1-24-29b, 30a]"
1-24-28,"Depending upon the strength of your own self-confidence you have to eradicate this evildoer, and assigned by me you have to make this province free from thorniness. [1-24-30b, 31a]"
1-24-29,"Indeed, none is able to enter this sort of province, Rama, destroyed by the hazardous and invincible unearthly being who turned into a demoness, namely Tataka, hence you have to make the provinces habitable. [1-24-31b, 32a]"
1-24-30,"As to how that ghoulish Tataka destroyed this entire forest, rendering it as a devastated place, without refraining from it even today, all that is narrated. So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-24-32]"
1-25-1,"On hearing the worthy words of that sage with inestimable power, then the tigerly man Rama replied him with estimable words. [1-25-1]"
1-25-2,"It is said that yaksha&#39;s strength is trivial, and this is an yakshii, more so a female, how then this yakshii frail by her femineity can exert the strength of a thousand elephants? [1-25-2]"
1-25-3,"On hearing the sentence of Raghava with illimitable dynamism, Vishvamitra said this sentence to the enemy subduer Rama along with Lakshmana, cheering them up with his pleasant words, Listen by which a female became outstanding by her strength... she assumes strength by the bestowal of a boon. [1-25-3, 4]"
1-25-4,"Once there was a formidable yaksha named Suketu, but he was childless, and he who had devout conduct performed a great ascesis. [1-25-5]"
1-25-5,"Gladdening at his ascesis, Rama, then the Forefather Brahma gave him a gemlike daughter who is renowned by the name of Tataka. [1-25-6]"
1-25-6,"Forefather Brahma also gave the strength of a thousand elephants to her, but he that highly remarkable Brahma did not give a son to that yaksha, anticipating male to be more hazardous. [1-25-7]"
1-25-7,"When that bright girl is growing up into a youthful beauty her father Suketu gave her to Jambha&#39;s son Sunda as wife. [1-25-8]"
1-25-8,"Then after sometime that yakshii Tataka delivered an indomitable son named Mareecha, who by curse became a demon. [1-25-9]"
1-25-9,"But when Sunda is eliminated by sage Agastya&#39;s curse, she that Tataka wished to retaliate that eminent sage along with her son Mareecha. [1-25-10]"
1-25-10,"With desperation brewing in her she roaringly rushed towards the sage as though to eat him away, and on seeing her rushing along with her son Mareecha towards him, the godly saint Agastya firstly cursed Mareecha saying, &#39;you will attain demon-hood.&#39; [1-25-11, 12a]"
1-25-11,"Highly infuriated sage Agastya even cursed Tataka saying, &#39;forthwith divested of this form of a beautiful female, oh, great yakshii, you shall become a man eater with your form distorted, face contorted, and shape monstrous.&#39; [1-25-12b, 13]"
1-25-12,"Frenzied by the curse and convulsed in fury she that Tataka is thus vandalising this auspicious province, in which sage Agastya once sauntered. [1-25-14]"
1-25-13,"She that highly atrocious one is with horrific behaviour and malefic valour, hence you shall eliminate this yakshii for the welfare of Brahmans and cows. [1-25-15]"
1-25-14,"Excepting you there is none to eliminate her who is indomitably sheathed in a curse, oh, Raghu&#39;s legatee, and none in the three worlds can possibly brave her. [1-25-16]"
1-25-15,"Compassion regarding the elimination of a female is ungermane, oh, best one among men, since a prince has to effectuate it intending the welfare of four categories of society. [1-25-17]"
1-25-16,"For the reason of protecting people, a protector always has to execute such deed, either it is ruthless or humane, sinful or vilifying. [1-25-18]"
1-25-17,"To the nominee who bears the burden of kingdom this is the age-old duty, and hence oh, Rama, the legatee of Kakutstha, eliminate this infamy, as goodness is inevident in her, isn&#39;t it. [1-25-19]"
1-25-18,"Oh, Rama, the protector of people, we have heard that Indra once eliminated Manthara, the daughter of Virochana, when she wished to annihilate earth, haven&#39;t we. [1-25-20]"
1-25-19,"And Rama, once Vishnu wiped out even the wife of sage Bhrigu and sage Shukracarya&#39;s mother when she wished the world to become one without a governing factor, namely Indra. [1-25-21]"
1-25-20,"Oh, prince, these great souls and many other celebrated personalities have eliminated females who deported themselves with unrighteousness, and hence, oh, Rama, the protector of people, by my decree you leave off compassion and eliminate her. Thus said sage Vishvamitra to Rama regarding Tataka&#39;s elimination. [1-25-22]"
1-26-1,"On hearing the words of that unfaltering sage about demoness Tataka, Raghava, best man&#39;s son who is firm in his vows, reverently adjoining his palms replied the sage. [1-26-1]"
1-26-2,"Upon my father&#39;s order, upon my honour to my father&#39;s word, and looking upon this as the word of sage Kushi&#39;s son, my mentor, this task is definitely to be implemented. [1-26-2]"
1-26-3,"What my great souled father Dasharatha directed me to do among elders in Ayodhya, that word too cannot be disregarded. [1-26-3]"
1-26-4,"Such as I am, I will undertake the primary duty of eliminating Tataka, according as the follower of father&#39;s words, and according to the instruction of a Brahma scholar, such as your are, without a doubt. [1-26-4]"
1-26-5,"I am ready to effectuate the bidding of an inestimable sage like you, for the welfare of cows and Brahmans, and for the advantage of this province. So said Rama to sage Vishvamitra. [1-26-5]"
1-26-6,"Saying thus, Rama, the enemy-destroyer, clenched his left fist on the handgrip in the middle of the bow, and with the right he made a thunderous sound of the bowstring making all the directions to blast. [1-26-6]"
1-26-7,"By that sound the inhabitants of Tataka forest are startled, and even Tataka is stupefied by that sound, and she is intolerably infuriated at it. [1-26-7]"
1-26-8,"She who is convulsed in anger to hear that sound gave attention to the direction wherefrom it emerged and she rancorously rushed thereto. [1-26-8]"
1-26-9,"Raghava on seeing that monstrous-looking demoness with a distorted face and who by proportions is very gigantic, furthermore infuriated, spoke to Lakshmana. [1-26-9]"
1-26-10,"Lakshmana, see that yakshii&#39;s grisly and ghastly physique, seeing which hearts of cowards are prone to burst. [1-26-10]"
1-26-11," She is unstoppable and has magical powers, is&#39;t, you may see now how I will make her to readily retreat by lopping off her ears and the tip of nose. [1-26-11]"
1-26-12,"As it is her femininess is protecting her, and I too I do not really attempt to kill her, but I intend to terminate her impudence and mobility. [1-26-12]"
1-26-13,"While Rama is still speaking that way, convulsed in anger Tataka roaringly rushed towards Rama alone, swinging her arms. [1-26-13]"
1-26-14,"But the Brahma-sage Vishvamitra daunted sounded her off and said to Rama and Lakshmana, let you be safe, and be victorious. [1-26-14]"
1-26-15,"Flinging up dreadful dust on those two Raghavaa-s, Tataka baffled them for a while with a massive cloud of dust. [1-26-15]"
1-26-16,"Then taking hold of witchery she inundated both the Raghava-s with highly torrential stone rain, by which Rama became indignant. [1-26-16]"
1-26-17,"On forestalling her effusive stone storming with his arrow storm, Rama even mutilated both of her arms with arrows while she rushed towards them. [1-26-17]"
1-26-18,"With her arms severed and fatigued she started to roar extremely at the nearby, and then provoked Lakshmana made her to loose her ears and the tip of nose by cutting them off. [1-26-18]"
1-26-19,"That guise changer vanished after variously altering her aspects, and then on baffling them with her illusoriness and discharging stone storms she moved about appallingly. [1-26-19, 20a]"
1-26-20,"And on seeing both Rama and Lakshmana who are being overspread by storms of stones from all-over, then the illustrious sage Vishvamitra spoke this sentence. [1-26-20b, 21a]"
1-26-21,"Enough is your compassion Rama, she is a sinister, behaviourally malevolent, a hinderer of rituals, and this yakshii gets a grip on herself in a short time by her illusory powers. [1-26-21b, 22a]"
1-26-22,"Sun is going to set in a short time, and only before that time she shall be destroyed, for demons at dusk and afterwards become unassailable, indeed. So said sage Viswamitra to Rama. [1-26-22b, 23a]"
1-26-23,"When Vishvamitra addressed him thus, Rama displaying his capacity in sonic archery forestalled that yakshii who has gone into invisibility and storming stone-storms, with his arrows. [1-26-23b, 24a]"
1-26-24,"And when the arrays of arrows obstructed her who possesses illusional powers, she dashed towards Rama and Lakshmana blaring stridently. [1-26-24b, 25a]"
1-26-25,"And Rama struck an arrow in her chest who is invading and speedily swooping down like a thunderbolt, and thus she is readily felled down and totally dropped dead, too. [1-26-25b, 26a]"
1-26-26,"On seeing her who is horrendous in her shape is  eliminated, Indra and other gods have highly esteemed Rama saying, admirable, admirable is this act. [1-26-26b, 27a]"
1-26-27,"The thousand eyed and the destroyer of enemy?s citadels Indra then spoke with high satisfaction, and even all of the gods are gladdened and said to Vishvamitra this way. [1-26-27b, 28a]"
1-26-28,"Oh, sage Vishvamitra, you are blessed, all the groups of wind-gods along with Indra are pleased, so you please show more concern for Raghava. [1-26-28b, 29a]"
1-26-29,"The sons of Prajapati Krishasva who are valiant by their virtue and who possess ascetic strength, oh, Brahman, they may be offered to Raghava. [1-26-29b, 30a]"
1-26-30,"Rama is steadfast in following your assignments and thus he is the worthy receiver of those missiles, and this prince has to accomplish a very great deed of gods. So said gods to Vishvamitra. [1-26-30b, 31a]"
1-26-31,"All the gods on saying thus and on extolling Vishvamitra they contentedly returned to heavens, and then the sunset has come to pass. [1-26-31b, 32a]"
1-26-32,"That best sage is satisfied with Rama and gladdened for the eradication of Tataka kissed the forehead of and then said this sentence. [1-26-32b, 33a]"
1-26-33,"Here we stay for tonight, Rama, the august one for a gaze, and tomorrow morning we will go to that hermitage of mine. So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-26-33b, 34a]"
1-26-34,"On listening sage Vishvamitra&#39;s words, Dasharatha&#39;s son Rama, comfortably stayed that night there in that forest of Tataka. [1-26-34]"
1-26-35,"On that very day alone that forest of Tataka too is released from the curse, and it shone forth like the luxurious heavenly garden of Kubera, namely Chiatra Ratha. [1-26-35b, c]"
1-26-36,"Rama while being eulogised by the groups of celestials and liberated Souls for complete elimination of yaksha&#39;s daughter, namely Tataka, stayed there along with the sage only to be awakened by the next day&#39;s sunrise. [1-26-36]"
1-27-1,"Then, on staying that night there in Tataka forest, on the next day morning the greatly renowned sage Vishvamitra, smilingly and wording sweetly spoke to Rama. [1-27-1]"
1-27-2,"I am highly pleased with you, oh, illustrious prince Rama, let safety be with you, I will now give you all of the divine missiles in utmost fondness of mine. [1-27-2]"
1-27-3,"I am going to accord all of those divine missiles by which scores of gods, demons, or even from gandharva-s, uragaa-s and the like, or even earthlings are dominated, humbled down and conquered in war. Let safety be with you. [1-27-3, 4a]"
1-27-4,"Raghava, I am going to give the highly divine Danda disc [Punisher disc]; next, oh, best one among men, Dharma disc [Virtue-disc,] and like that kaala disc [Time-disc]; then oh, brave one, Vishnu disc; similarly oh, dextrous Rama, Indra disc and Thunderbolt missile; the best trident pertaining to Shiva; the missile called Brahma-shira [Brahma-crest]; the missile called the Aishiika missile [Grass-Blade missile,] and that way oh, Raghava, I am going to give the unexcelled and highly formidable missile called Brahma missile. [1-27-4b, 5, 6, 7a]"
1-27-5,"Oh manly tiger prince Rama, I am going to accord two maces that are brilliant by their radiance called, the Modaki, [the Beater,] and Shikhari, [the Tower of Protection.] [1-27-7b, 8a]"
1-27-6,"Oh, Rama, like that I will be giving three nooses called Dharma paasha and kaala-paasha and Varuna paasha, [Virtue noose and Time noose, Rain god&#39;s noose] as well as an unequalled missile called Varuna astra, Rain-god&#39;s missile. [1-27-8b, 9a]"
1-27-7,"Oh, Raghu&#39;s scion, I will also give two projectile bolts, one called shushka [The Drier] and the other aardra [The Drencher] and even the missiles of Pinaaka and that of Narayana, [the missiles of god Shiva and Narayana] I will give. [1-27-9b, 10a]"
1-27-8,"Oh, impeccable Rama, thus a well-known missile shikhari [The Tower] and another the fond of Fire-god known as prathama [The Blower] and a missile of Air-god too, I will be giving. [1-27-10b, 11a]"
1-27-9,"Oh, Raghava of Kakutstha-s, I will give you two missiles named Haya-shira [The Horse-head] and Krouncha [The Wrester] and two Impellers, one presided over by the power of Vishnu, and the other by the power of Rudra. [1-27-11b, 12a]"
1-27-10,"I will be giving all those weapons that are wielded by demons, namely the deadly Pounder named Kankaalam, and Rods named as Kapaalam and Kankanam, for the elimination of those very demons. [1-27-12b, 13a]"
1-27-11,"Oh, mighty armed son of the best king, I am giving a great missile named Vaidyadhara by its name, and a gem of sword named Nandana. [1-27-13b, 14a]"
1-27-12,"Thus, the missile which is very much liked by Gandharva-s, namely Mohana, [The Stupefier,] the missile called Prasvapana [The Inducer of Sleep,] and the gentle Prashamana [The Pacifier of enemy&#39;s anger.] [1-27-14b, 15a]"
1-27-13,"Oh, highly fortunate Rama, take these missiles namely, varshaNa, [the Rainer,] shoshana [the Drainer,] santaapana [the Humidifier,] vilaapana [the Weep-inducer,] and oh, prince, an unassailable intoxicator and a dear missile of Manmatha, namely Mohana [The Intoxicator,] and another the fond missile of gandharva-s namely maanava by its name, [The Humane missile,] and oh, tigerly man, a missile dear one to pishaaca-s, monsters, namely paishaca [The Monster missile.] [1-27-15, 16, 17]"
1-27-14,"Oh, manly-tiger Rama, greatly powered taamasa and saumana missiles, the indomitable missiles like samvarta, mausala, satya, and then the maaya-maya missile; like that oh, mighty armed Rama, a solar missile the sequestrator of others&#39; brilliance namely teja-prabha; next, the missile of Moon-god named shishira [The Cooler]; and a very deadly missile of tvaSTa namely sudaamana; and even the dangerous missile of bhaga namely shita-iSu, these and the maanava missile of Manu, the earliest ruler of mankind, I will be giving. [1-27-17b, 18, 19, 20]"
1-27-15,"These missiles are, oh, dextrous prince, disguise-wizards, greatly powered, and highly providential ones, oh, Rama, you may take them forthwith. So said sage Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-27-21]"
1-27-16,"That pre-eminent sage Vishvamitra on performing his personal holy depuration then gave the assortment of extraordinary hymns to Rama facing eastward. [1-27-22]"
1-27-17,"The comprehension of which invoking hymns of the missiles is impossible even to gods with their sections and subsections of procedures, that Brahman dedicated such hymns to Raghava. [1-27-24]"
1-27-18,"While that intelligent saint Vishvamitra chanted the hymns, all of those highly venerable missiles came nigh and stood accessible to Raghava in their astral form. [1-27-24]"
1-27-19,"All of those highly obliging missiles in astral bodies, gladdening to come under the aegis of Rama, then spoke to him making palms-fold, here are your thralls, Sire, we are here to accomplish whatever you bid us to do, let safety be with you. So said the deities presiding over the missiles to Rama. [1-27-25]"
1-27-20,"On receiving them with a pleased heart, then Rama patted them with his palm, and that Rama of Kakutstha-s also spoke this way to those mightily forceful missiles in ethereal bodies saying, you may manifest yourselves in my cognisance whenever I need you, and he motivated them to take leave and to come back at his beck and call. [1-27-26b, 27]"
1-27-21,"That highly resplendent Rama revered sage Vishvamitra with a thankful heart and readied himself for further journey. [1-27-26]"
1-28-1,"On becoming personally purified Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha-s, received the missiles, and then on their way he is now speaking to Sage Vishvamitra with a pleasant face. [1-28-1]"
1-28-2,"Oh, godly sage, I have taken the missiles and became unassailable even for gods, but oh, eminent sage, I wish to know the annulment of missiles too. So said Rama to the sage. [1-28-2]"
1-28-3,"When Rama of Kakutstha said thus, next that resolute, well-averred and purified sage of eminence Vishvamitra imparted the knowledge of annulment missiles. [1-28-3]"
1-28-4,"Oh, Raghava, take these radiant missile-children of Krishaasva from me, namely Satyavanta, Satyakeerti, Dhristha, Rabhasa, Pratihaaratara, Paraanmuka, Avaanmukha, Lakshya, Alakshya, Dhridhanaabha, Sunaabha, Dashaaksha, Shatavaktra, Dashasheersha, Shatodara, Padmanaabha, Mahaanaabha, Dundunaabha, Svanaabha, Jyotisha, Shakuna, Nairaashya, Vimala, Yaugandhara, Vinidra, Daitya, Pramadhana, Suchibaahu, Mahaabaahu, Nishkali, Viruchi, Saarchirmaali, Dhritirmaali, Vrittiman, Ruchira, Pitrya, Saumanasa, and also thus Vidhoota, Makara, are two of them...Karaveerakara, Dhana, Dhaanya, Kaamaroopa, Kaamaruchi, Moha, Aavarana, and thus Jrimbhaka, Sarvanaabha, Varana... and these are the guise changing wizards and you are the eligible one to handle these missiles, let safety be with you. Thus Vishvamitra gave missiles to Rama. [1-28-4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"
1-28-5,"Gladdening in his heart of hearts Rama of Kakutstha received the annulment missiles saying, Agreed! Sire! Those missiles are with radiantly divine bodies, appealing and endowing bliss. Some are fire-like, some smoke-like, and some moon-like and some sun-like, and such as they are, some of them holding out their hollowed palms, and some with palms adjoined melodiously spoke to Rama saying, here we are, oh, tigerly man, what can we do for you. [1-28-11, 12, 13]"
1-28-6,"While remaining in my memory you assist me as and when needed, and till then you may go away as you wish, thus that legatee of Raghu-s said to those deities of annulment missiles. [1-28-14]"
1-28-7,"Saying it will be done that way to Rama, the legatee of Kakutstha-s, also on performing circumambulation to him and then on taking his consent those deities have gone away as they have come. [1-28-15]"
1-28-8,"After learning the nullifying missiles and then while proceeding on the walkway Raghava asked the great sage Vishvamitra with sweet and soft words. [1-28-16]"
1-28-9,"What is this cloudlike picturesque thicket shining forth not very far away on this side of mountain, with animals spreading over it, and embellished with numerous kinds of birds that have pleasant callings it is highly soul-delighting, thus, my inquisitiveness is growing very much to know it, what is this, really! [1-28-17, 18]"
1-28-10,"By the nature of happy environs at this place, oh, eminent sage, I understand that we have come out of the extremely alarming forest of Tataka, but oh, god, whose hermitage&#39;s threshold is this, kindly tell me all. [1-28-19]"
1-28-11,"Oh, great saint, where are those murderers of Brahmans? Oh, venerable one, at which place those evil minded sinners and evildoers will be coming to hinder your ritual? And where, oh, Brahman, I have to safeguard your ritual ceremonies, and demons too are to be eliminated? Oh, eminent sage, what is that place? I would like to hear all of it. Rama asked Vishvamitra in that way. [1-28-20b, 21, 22]"
1-29-1,"When that matchlessly illustrious Rama has asked for details, that highly resplendent sage Vishvamitra started to narrate about that forest to Rama. [1-29-1]"
1-29-2,"Here, oh, dextrous Rama, he who is worshipped by gods and who has got outstanding ascesis that Vishnu resided here in the pursuit of practising ascesis and yoga for good many years, likewise for a hundred eras. [1-29-2, 3a]"
1-29-3,"This is the erstwhile hermitage of great-souled Vaamana renowned as Accomplished hermitage, why because the sage with supreme ascesis Kaashyapa got accomplishment to such of his ascesis there only. [1-29-3b, 4a]"
1-29-4,"In the meantime, when Vishnu was in his asceticism in this hermitage, the son of King Virochana, namely Bali, has completely conquered all the assemblages of gods together with Indra and his coterie called Wind-gods, and ruling that kingdom where that hermitage is there, he has become renowned in all the three worlds for his magnanimity. [1-29-4b, 5]"
1-29-5,"That great mighty chief of demons Bali then conducted a very grand Vedic ritual. But when Bali is conducting that ritual remaining as its officiator all the gods personally approached Vishnu, keeping Fire-god ahead of them, just here in this hermitage and they spoke to him. [1-29-6]"
1-29-6," &#39;Oh, all-pervading god Vishnu, Bali the son of Virochana is conducting an unsurpassed Vedic ritual, before the completion of which our own mission, say the task of gods, is to be achieved completely. [1-29-7]"
1-29-7," &#39;Whoever the supplicant might be and from wherever he might be coming, but if one approaches and supplicates to him he is donating that in as is where is condition, whatever is supplicated and wherever it might be. [1-29-8]"
1-29-8," &#39;As such, oh, Vishnu, you may effectuate the most suitable merited deed for the welfare of gods on resorting to your illusory power, Vishnu Maya, and on assuming the form of a dwarf to deal with Emperor Bali.&#39; Thus gods appealed to Vishnu. [1-29-9]"
1-29-9,"In the meanwhile, oh Rama, he whose brilliance is similar to ritual fire, who will be with his wife Lady Aditi, who is resplendent with his own vitality, that godly sage Kaashyapa on completing his asceticism along with Lady Aditi started to eulogise the boon giver and the eliminator of demon Madhu, namely Vishnu. Thus Vishvamitra is narrating to Rama. [1-29-10, 11]"
1-29-10," &#39;Oh, Supreme Person, you are abounding with asceticism, aggregate of asceticism, the aspect of asceticism, and the very soul of asceticism, such as you are, I am able to see you with the well practised asceticism of mine. [1-29-12]"
1-29-11," &#39;In your physique I am seeing this entire universe, oh, god, and you are without a beginning and indefinable, and in you I am taking shelter.&#39; Sage Kaashyapa praised Vishnu in this way. [1-29-13]"
1-29-12,"Vishnu is gladdened for the devotion of sage Kaashyapa who is absolved of any blemish in his ascesis, and then Vishnu said this to, You may seek a boon as you are boon-worthy, I opine that you are a preferred one to me, let safety be with you. Thus Vishnu said to Kaashyapa. [1-29-14]"
1-29-13,"On hearing the word of Vishnu sage Kaashyapa, the son of Sage Mariicha said, oh, god the accorder of boons, as you are pleased with us it will be apt of you to bestow the boon besought by Lady Aditi and the gods, oh, lord with lofty vows, for which boon I am also supplicating to you, following them. [1-29-15, 16a]"
1-29-14," &#39;Oh, god, oh, sinless one, you may please attain the sonship of Lady Aditi and myself, oh, dispenser of demons, it will be apt of you to render help to gods who are agonised in the anguish owing to the predominance of Emperor Bali, by becoming the younger brother of Indra. [1-29-16b, 17]"
1-29-15," &#39;Oh, god of gods, as the works of my austerities are accomplished             here, by your grace this hermitage will be renowned by the name Siddhaashram,             Hermitage of Accomplishment, hence oh god, arise from here to become my son.&#39; So said sage Kaashyapa to Vishnu. [1-29-18]"
1-29-16,"That great resplendent Vishnu then adopting a semblance of a dwarf emerged from Aditi, and that dwarfish ascetic boy approached Emperor Bali, the son of Virochana. Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. [1-29-19]"
1-29-17,"That dwarf ascetic boy Vaamana begged and received a space that can be covered in three strides, but strode all the three worlds in those three steps for the purpose of saving worlds, as he is interested in the welfare of all the worlds. Vishnu gave the earth back to Indra restraining Emperor Bali with his vitality. Thus that great resplendent Vishnu made the three worlds to come under the control of Indra again. [1-29-20, 21]"
1-29-18,"This hermitage which at one time is presided by Vishnu, is an eradicator of stress, either the stress and strain caused by the evil on earth, or the stress of going through the cycle of birth and death, thus this hermitage is an accorded of salvation, and I am also beneficed with this hermitage owing to my devotion to Vaamana. [1-29-22]"
1-29-19,"Demons causing obstacles, oh, tigerly man Rama, will be arriving at that hermitage and there alone those demons with evil pursuit are to be eliminated. [1-29-23]"
1-29-20,"Rama, we now go to the unexcelled hermitage of Accomplishment, oh, dear one, as to how this hermitage belongs to me, this also belongs to you. Thus Vishvamitra said to Rama. [1-29-24]"
1-29-21,"So saying that great sage Vishvamitra is highly gladdened to lead Rama together with Lakshmana to the hermitage, and on his entering the hermitage with those two, that sage shone forth like moon with a two starred constellation called Punarvasu, the fifth or seventh lunar mansion, after dispersal of mist. [1-29-25]"
1-29-22,"On seeing the arrival of Vishvamitra all of the resident sages of Accomplished Hermitage have quickly approached him with hustle and bustle adoring him. [1-29-26]"
1-29-23,"Those sages reverenced Vishvamitra according to their deservedness, likewise they have offered hospitality to both of the princes, Rama and Lakshmana. [1-29-27]"
1-29-24,"Those two princes from Raghu&#39;s dynasty and the enemy-subjugators, namely Rama and Lakshmana, briefly took rest and adjoining palms they spoke to the sagely tiger Vishvamitra. [1-29-28]"
1-29-25,"Oh, the eminent sage, today itself you may undertake the ritual of solemnity that is undertaken prior to the main ritual, be safe, and let this Hermitage of Accomplishment become an accomplished one in eradiating vice true to its name, and let the word of yours given to my father in fetching me to this place come true. So said Rama to Vishvamitra, supported by Lakshmana. [1-29-29]"
1-29-26,"When he is said so, that great radiant and supreme sage Vishvamitra, thereupon scrupulously undertook the vow of ritual controlling his senses. [1-29-30]"
1-29-27,"Both the youngsters Rama and Lakshmana on spending that night vigilantly got up with the sunrise. On finishing morning time bathing they meditated upon the easterly aurora, and then on completing the supreme meditation on Gayatri in its regularity, they addressed themselves to sage Vishvamitra, who by now has enkindled ritual fire and sitting before the Altar of Fire. [1-29-31, 32]"
1-30-1,"The two enemy subjugators, Rama and Lakshmana, who are sensible of their conduct according to time and place, and who will be sensibly talking according to time and place, those princes then spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. [1-30-1]"
1-30-2,"Oh, god, we are interested to listen at which time those night-walkers come to disturb the ritual, and at which time we have to safeguard the ritual from them, that you tell us, let not that moment pass away. [1-30-2]"
1-30-3,"All the sages available there are delighted with the princes of Kakutstha dynasty who are speaking thus and making haste for a combat with demons and they praised them. [1-30-3]"
1-30-4,"Oh, Raghava-s, you have to safeguard this ritual for six nights and days from today, and this Sage Vishvamitra who is under the vow of ritual goes into muteness as required by the vow. Thus said the other sages near at ritual place. [1-30-4]"
1-30-5,"On hearing that sentence of the other sages those two glorious princes have wakefully safeguarded that woodland of the ritual for six nights and days. [1-30-5]"
1-30-6,"On alertly patrolling nearby the Altar of Fire those two enemy-destroyers who are the wielders of great bows and valiant ones have protected the best sage Vishvamitra. [1-30-6]"
1-30-7,"While that period of six days is elapsing and when the sixth day has come, then Rama said to Saumitri, you be prepared and be on alert. [1-30-7]"
1-30-8,"While Rama is saying thus himself quickening to combat then the fire in the Altar of Fire flared up suddenly and highly, brightening the chief officiator of the ritual, namely Vishvamitra, and other priests around it. [1-30-8]"
1-30-9,"The Altar of Fire around which sacred grass, drink-vessels, oblation spoons, firewood-sticks, and heaps of flowers are kept, and around which Vishvamitra and the conductors of ritual are sitting, that altar flared high. [1-30-9]"
1-30-10,"While the Vedic ritual is proceeding well towards its conclusion according to hymnal rendering and rules of conducting the ritual, a strident and frightening blare is generated in the sky. [1-30-10]"
1-30-11,"As to how massive clouds appear in torrential cloudburst, likewise two demons appeared enshrouding the sky, and performing wizardry they are about to swoop down towards the Altar of Fire. [1-30-11]"
1-30-12,"Maareecha and Subaahu are the monstrous demons that have come along with their followers and they have started to pour down spates of blood. [1-30-12]"
1-30-13,"On noticing the Altar of Fire swamped with streams of blood, then Rama swiftly ran towards that direction and saw the demons in the sky. [1-30-13]"
1-30-14,"Perceiving that the two demons are about to swoop down on Altar of Fire in haste, that lotus-eyed Rama however gave a quick checking look at Lakshmana saying this sentence. [1-30-14]"
1-30-15,"Lakshmana, I am reluctant to eliminate this kind of these ill-behaved and raw flesh eating demons, but no doubt, they will be puffed out with Manava missile like a gust puffing thick clouds, you may see. Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [1-30-15, 16a]"
1-30-16,"Saying so that agile Rama fitted the very benign and highly radiant arrow Maanava on his bow, and taking aim with it at Maareecha that highly furious Raghava darted it on the chest of Maareecha. [1-30-16b, 17]"
1-30-17,"Cleanly hit with that great missile Maanava, demon Maareecha is pitched for a hundred yojana lengths in full, and flung down into an ocean rocking with tidewaters. [1-30-18]"
1-30-18,"On seeing him highly whirling, rendered insensate and thrown out when rammed away with the strength of that Cold arrow Rama said this to Lakshmana. [1-30-19]"
1-30-19,"Lakshmana, see the Cold arrow belonging to Maanava missile expounded by Manu which is taking him away on baffling, but without taking away his life. [1-30-20]"
1-30-20,"But I wish to kill these demons for they are ruthless, iniquitous, flagitious, ritual-hinderers and blood-drinkers. So said Rama to Lakshmana. [1-30-21]"
1-30-21,"Thus saying to Lakshmana, as though to show his swift dexterity Rama, the descendent of Raghu dynasty, took up a very powerful missile called Aagneya astra, Fire-missile, and darted it on the chest of Subaahu, by which that demon Subaahu is struck and fell flat on ground. [1-30-22]"
1-30-22,"In order to bring felicity to the sages that great glorious and supremely generous Raghava took up the missile of Air-god and hit down the remaining demons. [1-30-23]"
1-30-23,"When Rama, the delight of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, has eliminated all of the demons that are the hinderers of Vedic rituals, the sages available there in that hermitage idealised him as Indra was idealised once, when he became victories on demons. [1-30-24]"
1-30-24,"On the completion of ritual beholding the precincts that are devoid of calamities the great sage Vishvamitra said this to Rama. [1-30-25]"
1-30-25,"My purpose in conducting the ritual is fully realised, oh, dextrous Rama, and you too, as a highly illustrious prince, have actualised the word of honour of your mentor, where one mentor is your father King Dasharatha and the other is myself, and likewise oh, valiant Rama the glory of this Accomplished hermitage is also actualised... thus when Vishvamitra is applauding Rama, they have come close to vesper-time for vespertine prayers on Sandhya, the goddess of gloaming. [1-30-26]"
1-31-1,"Rejoicing for achieving the result of their journey with Vishvamitra, the brave Rama and Lakshmana then resided in that hermitage for that night, gladdening in their heart of hearts. [1-31-1]"
1-31-2,"When that night turned into a new day, performing their morning chores both of the brother jointly approached Sage Vishvamitra, who is along with other sages by then. [1-31-2]"
1-31-3,"And those gentle-speakers on reverencing that eminent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance is akin to the ritual-fire, they two spoke this highly courteous sentence to him. [1-31-3]"
1-31-4,"Oh, tigerly-sage, here are your attendants sir, available in your attendance, what order is to be carried out further, oh, eminent saint, that you may order us. [1-31-4]"
1-31-5,"When they have said that way all those great sages spoke to Rama, keeping Vishvamitra at the helm of affairs. [1-31-5]"
1-31-6,"Oh, best one among men, a highly righteous Vedic ritual belonging to King Janaka of Mithila is going to take place, and we the sages are going over there. [1-31-6]"
1-31-7,"Oh, tigerly-man Rama, if you can come along with us, it will be expedient for you to see a monumental gem of bow there. [1-31-7]"
1-31-8,"Oh, best one among men, in early times indeed gods gave that awesome bow which has an unimaginable power and which is superbly incandescent in wars to an erstwhile king of Mithila in a congregation of a Vedic-ritual. [1-31-8]"
1-31-9,"Gods cannot capably lift it to string; gandharva-s, no; asura-s, no; demons, no; and for human beings, not in any way. [1-31-9]"
1-31-10,"Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great mighty princes are rendered incapable to string its bowstring. [1-31-10]"
1-31-11,"Oh, tigerly-man Rama, there in Mithila you can see that particular bow of the great-souled king of Mithila and his highly admirable Vedic ritual too, if you come with us. [1-31-11]"
1-31-12,"Once Devaraata, the grandparent of the present king Janaka of Mithila, conducted a Vedic-ritual and he indeed prayed only for this supreme bow with a best grip-handle as the fruit of that ritual from all of the gods and oh, tigerly man Rama, he got the same from them. [1-31-12]"
1-31-13,"That bow has got a regular worship and especially during the periods of<font color=""#B3003A"">dhanur utsava</font>-s, festivals of bows-and- arrows. Hence it is kept in the palace of King of Mithila, and oh, Raghava it is worshipped with a variety of sandalwood pastes, scents of aloe substance, and with incenses. [1-31-13]"
1-31-14,"Saying so that best saint Vishvamitra started to travel on along with the assemblages of sages, and even along with Rama and Lakshmana, whose tacit consent to follow the sage is obtained by now, and on bidding farewell to the deities of woodlands of that Accomplished Hermitage, where his ritual is accomplished with the help of Rama and Lakshmana. [1-31-14]"
1-31-15,"Adieu, georgic deities, everything bodes well to you all, on accomplishment of the ritual I have undertaken here, I wish to go from this Accomplished Hermitage towards the ranges of Himalayan Mountains that are on the northern bank of River Ganga. [1-31-15]"
1-31-16,"Thus saying farewell to woodland-deities that descendent of Kaushika, namely Vishvamitra, the saint whose wealth is his ascesis started to journey on aiming to reach the northern side of River Ganga. [1-31-16]"
1-31-17,"While that best saint set forth, the team of his close followers who are the advocators of Vedic canons have moved behind him, approximately with a hundred carts loaded with their ritual paraphernalia. [1-31-17]"
1-31-18,"Even the residents of that Hermitage of Accomplishment, namely animals and birds, closely followed that great-souled Vishvamitra, whose wealth is his ascesis, in herds and flocks. But that sage Vishvamitra made those flocks of birds and the herds of animals to return to their places, as they have shown enough courtesy. [1-31-18, 19a]"
1-31-19,"Those assemblages of sages on going far on their path made a camp on the bank of River Sona when the sun is dangling towards west. [1-31-19b, 20a]"
1-31-20,"When the sun went into dusk those sages with illimitable resplendence took their bath and on kindling the consumer of kindled oblations they completed their evening fire ritual, and then squatted before sage Vishvamitra. [1-31-20b, 21a]"
1-31-21,"And even Rama along with Lakshmana on worshipping those sages squatted before that intellectual Vishvamitra. [1-31-21b, 22a]"
1-31-22,"With growing inquisitiveness that resplendent Rama has asked the tigerly sage Vishvamitra whose wealth is his ascesis. [1-31-22b, 23a]"
1-31-23,"Oh, godly sage, this place is glistening with well-developed woodlands, really what is this place? You be blest! It will be apt of you tell about it, in essence. Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra.[1-31-23b, 24a]"
1-31-24,"Sage Vishvamitra whose vows are unselfish and whose ascesis is exalted is motivated with the words of Rama and staying amidst the sages he started to tell all about that place. [1-31-24b, c]"
1-32-1,"Once there was a highly righteous kingly sage who is the brainchild of Brahma, whose ascesis is of higher order, who has never flouted the rules of rituals or his vows, and who revered the knowers of virtue by name Kusha. Thus Sage Vishvamitra commenced narration. [1-32-1]"
1-32-2,"That great-souled Kusha begot four selfsame and mighty sons, namely Kushamba, Kushanaabha, Adhuurtarajasa also called as Asuurtarajasa,  and Vasu through the princess of Vidarbha, which princess is of noble birth and an eligible wife of Kusha. [1-32-2, 3a]"
1-32-3,"With an aspiration that his sons shall uphold the principles of Kshatriya-s, Kusha spoke to them who are brilliant, highly enthusiastic, virtue abiding, and the advocators of truth saying, &#39;establish your rulership, sons, and achieve righteousness abundantly.&#39; [1-32-3b, 4]"
1-32-4,"On hearing the words of Kusha those four sons that are the formidable ones in the world and the best men among people initiated to build four cities. [1-32-5]"
1-32-5,"Great-resplendent Kushamba built the city named Kaushambii for his part, and for his part the virtue-souled Kushanaabha built a city named Mahodaya. [1-32-6]"
1-32-6,"Oh, Rama, noble-minded Adhuurtarajasa built a city named Dharmaaranya, and king Vasu built a city in the name of Girivraja. [1-32-7]"
1-32-7,"This land on which we are presently staying is known as the land of virtue-souled Vasu, all around which these five best mountains are standing high. [1-32-8]"
1-32-8,"This charming river that enters and exits Magadha province is well known as the worthy River Maagadhi, and flowing amid the five of these elevated mountains it shines forth like a garland enwreathing them. [1-32-9]"
1-32-9,"""Though many kings were inquisitive about the power of that bow, all of those great mighty princes are rendered incapable to string its bowstring."
1-32-10,"This Maagadhi is that river which pertains to the developmental works of the great-souled king Vasu and oh, Rama, flowing towards east to its confluence in Ganga, this river garlands best farmlands and their crops on its way. [1-32-10]"
1-32-11,"The virtue-souled kingly saint Kushanaabha gave birth to a hundred daughters with unexcelled beauty through a celestial female called Ghritaachi. [1-32-11]"
1-32-12,"Those girls when attained youthfulness they are lovely and on an occasion they have gone to gardens and moved there about like one lightning with a hundred streaks during rainy season, and while those girls that are decorated with select ornaments are singing, dancing and playing musical instruments, they got into a fantastic felicity. [1-32-12, 13]"
1-32-13,"On their coming to parklands those girls whose all limbs are pretty and whose looks are unparalleled on earth, they looked like stars amid clouds within the cloudy thickets of garden bushes. [1-32-14]"
1-32-14,"On seeing them who are flourishing with all their aspects together with comeliness and ripeness, the all pervading Air-god, Vayu, spoke this word to them. [1-32-15]"
1-32-15," &#39;I have a desire for you all, hence leaving off the notions pertaining to human beings you all become my wives, thereby you too will acquire longevity like divinities. [1-32-16]"
1-32-16," &#39;Teenage is always transitory, expressly in humans, but on marrying me you will achieve undiminished youthfulness and forever you can be youthful like immortal females.&#39; Thus Air-god said to those girls. [1-32-17]"
1-32-17,"On hearing that proposal of Vayu, the Air-god whose strives are unimpeded, then those hundred girls spoke this sentence laughing off his proposal. [1-32-18]"
1-32-18," &#39;we are aware that you inspirit all the living beings from inside, oh, the ablest divinity, we are also aware of your uniqueness. But, what for you are dishonouring all of us. [1-32-19]"
1-32-19," &#39;We are the daughters of Kushanaabha, oh, best divinity, and we are all capable of displacing you from your realm, but oh, god, we are restraining ourselves in doing so only to conserve our ascetic values. [1-32-20]"
1-32-20," &#39;That time shall never come, oh, god with sordid thinking, when we, at our liberty, may look up for our grooms overlooking our veracious father.&#39; [1-32-21]"
1-32-21," &#39;Our father is indeed our lord and for us he is the ultimate god too. To whomever we are offered by our father in marriage he alone becomes our husband.&#39; So said hundred girls to Air-god. [1-32-22]"
1-32-22,"On hearing their sentence of rejection, Vayu, the Air-god whose impact is powerful, very angrily entered into all of the limbs of those girls only to disfigure them. [1-32-23]"
1-32-23,"Those girls whom Air-god disfigured in that way have entered palace-chambers of the king, but they have entered diffidently, embarrassedly, and tearfully. [1-32-24]"
1-32-24,"That king on seeing his dear and attractive daughters as disfigured and despondent girls he is highly perturbed and said this. [1-32-25]"
1-32-25," &#39;Oh, daughters, what all is this? Who disregarded probity? Who disfigured you all? Let it be said! Why you gesticulate saying nothing.&#39; asking thus that king sighed and quietened down waiting for a reply. Thus Sage Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-32-26]"
1-33-1,"On hearing that sentence of scholarly Kushanaabha those hundred girls touched his feet with their foreheads and spoke to him. [1-33-1]"
1-33-2," &#39;The all-pervasive Air-god desired to dishonour us, oh, king, resorting to improper approach and overlooking virtuous conduct. [1-33-2]"
1-33-3," &#39;Our father is there and we are not independent, you be safe, hence oh, Air-god, you may request our father to know whether he gives us to you or not.&#39; Thus we have told the Air-god, but... [1-33-3]"
1-33-4," &#39;Though we all have spoken to him thus, that Air-god who is bound by venality refused to take notice of our words and he has harmed us a lot.&#39; Thus those girls informed their father. [1-33-4]"
1-33-5,"On listening their words that highly virtuous and highly resplendent king spoke to the hundred girls with unsurpassed virtue. [1-33-5]"
1-33-6," &#39;Forgiving is the duty of imperturbable and you have done it. Excellent. Oh, daughters, coursing through your unity my family&#39;s prestige is also kept up. [1-33-6]"
1-33-7," &#39;Forgiveness is an adornment to women, as a matter of fact, even for men, and this matter called &#39;forgiving&#39; that which is there, it is an impracticable affair. That too, in respect of divinities. And the kind of forgiveness you all possess uniformly, that is further laudable. [1-33-7, 8a]"
1-33-8," &#39;Grace is altruism, grace is ritualism, oh, my daughters, grace is glory, grace is virtue, and this universe is verily abiding in graciousness alone for grace itself is the truth, isn&#39;t it!&#39; Thus king Kushanaabha said to his daughters and sent them away. [1-33-8b, 9a]"
1-33-9,"On leaving those girls, oh, Rama, that king whose valour matches that of gods and who is an expert in thinking strategies started to think with his ministers on the topics like, as to how his daughters are to be espoused to, to which country they are to be sent, at which time marriage shall happen, and to which matching bridegroom the marriage is to be proposed, and so on. Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-33-9b, 10]"
1-33-10,"During that time a great-resplendent sage named Cuulii is there, who is propitious in his demeanour and who holds his semen upward, and who has achieved high ascetic practise strictly according to Vedic canons. [1-33-11]"
1-33-11,"While that sage is in the practise of asceticism a celestial female served him at the place of his ascesis, safety be with you oh, Rama, she is Somada by her name, the daughter of Urmila. [1-33-12]"
1-33-12,"Even she is obedient in his respect, and dedicating herself in ministering to him she stayed there righteously. After some time that sage Cuulii has become satisfied with her service. [1-33-13]"
1-33-13,"When her service is fructified, oh, Rama, that sage benevolently spoke to her saying, &#39;I am perfectly pleased with your service, let good betide you, what cherish of yours I have to fulfil.&#39; [1-33-14]"
1-33-14,"Perceiving that the sage is contented that female celestial Somada who is aware of making good sentences is highly delighted and spoke with her melodious voice to that pedantic sage. [1-33-15]"
1-33-15," &#39;Vedic splendour is flourishing in you when you have become one with Brahma, oh, supreme ascetic, I may please be endowed with a righteous son whose ascetic spirituality may embody the spirituality enunciated in Veda-s. [1-33-16]"
1-33-16," &#39;I am unmarried and nobody&#39;s wife, safe you be, and as I took shelter under your kindness it will be apt of you to endow me a son with your faculty of asceticism.&#39; So said Somada to sage Cuulii. [1-33-17]"
1-33-17,"That Brahma-sage Cuuli benignantly bestowed her with a unique and Brahma-like son who is renowned as Brahmadatta, as well as his own brainchild. [1-33-18]"
1-33-18,"King Brahmadatta endued with superb grandeur ruled from a city called Kaampilya as with Indra ruling the heaven. [1-33-19]"
1-33-19,"The most righteous king Kushanaabha then made up his mind, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, to espouse his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta. [1-33-20]"
1-33-20,"Inviting Brahmadatta that great-resplendent lord of the land, namely the king Kushanaabha, married his hundred daughters to him, pleasing highly in his heart of hearts. [1-33-21]"
1-33-21,"As with the tradition of marriage king Brahmadatta who vies with lord of gods, namely Indra, in succession took the palm of each of the hundred girls into his palm. [1-33-22]"
1-33-22,"By mere touch of hand of Brahmadatta alone, their misshape and desperation are evanished, and all of those hundred maidens beamed bright as they are retouched with utmost elegance. [1-33-23]"
1-33-23,"On seeing his daughters getting release from the effect of Air-god Kushanaabha became highly joyful, and he took great delight time and again as and when he looked at them. [1-33-24]"
1-33-24,"Later when the marriage is complete king Kushanaabha bade farewell to king Brahmadatta along with his wives, his own hundred daughters, and along with the groups of religious teachers. [1-33-25]"
1-33-25,"Somada, the celestial female and the mother of Brahmadatta, is gladdened to see her son Brahmadatta, for the worthwhile deed done by him in removing the blemish caused by the Air-god to the girls, or in bringing those worthwhile girls as her daughter-in-laws. She is further gladdened while her feet are traditionally and repeatedly touched by a hundred daughter-in-laws in succession, coupled with her own raising of each of the daughter-in-law to embrace for a hundred times. Thus Somada has gone on caressing each of her hundred daughter-in-laws, and in doing so she is gladdened to do so over and over again, she is gladdened. She thus praised Kushanaabha for giving his gemlike daughters as her daughter-in-laws and blessed the daughter-in-laws. [1-33-26]"
1-34-1,"When Brahmadatta has married and left, oh, Raghava, king Kushanaabha he embarked on Vedic-ritual called <font color="" #B3003A"">putrakaameSThi</font> in order to beget a son because is sonless. [1-34-1]"
1-34-2,"During the performance of the ritual, supremely generous Kusha, the brainchild of Brahma and the father of Kushanaabha, spoke to the king Kushanaabha. [1-34-2]"
1-34-3," &#39;Oh, son, there will be a highly virtuous and selfsame son of yours, known as Gaadhi, and through him you also will get everlasting renown in the world.&#39;  Thus Kusha said to Kushanaabha. [1-34-3]"
1-34-4,"Saying so, oh, Rama, Kushanaabha&#39;s father Kusha entered the sky and journeyed to the time-honoured abode of Brahma. [1-34-4]"
1-34-5,"Then after some time that highly intellectual Kushanaabha begot a supremely righteous son known by the name Gaadhi. [1-34-5]"
1-34-6,"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, that eminently righteous Gaadhi is my father, and since I am born in Kusha dynasty, oh, Raghu&#39;s legatee, I got the name Kaushika. Sage Vishvamitra thus narrating to Rama. [1-34-6]"
1-34-7,"Even my elder sister who undertook benevolent vows and who is renowned by her name Satyavathi is there, oh, Raghava, and she is given in marriage to sage Ruchika. [1-34-7]"
1-34-8,"She journeyed to heaven with her body while she followed her departed husband and being a very generous lady she coursed as a great river renowned as River Kaushiki. [1-34-8]"
1-34-9,"Desiring to yield benefit for the welfare of world, my sister has emerged with her divinely pious and delightful waters, taking recourse to Himalayan Mountains. [1-34-9]"
1-34-10,"Thereby, oh, Rama, I am delightfully and abidingly residing on the mountainsides of Himalayas, in adjacency of my sister Kausiki in all my affection for her. [1-34-10]"
1-34-11,"She that Satyavathi for her part is a pious one, steadfast in truthfulness and righteousness, a husband devote, and such a highly fortunate one has emerged as a best river among rivers, namely River Kaushiki. [1-34-11]"
1-34-12,"Owing to my vow, oh, Rama, I left her for a while and came to the Accomplished Hermitage and owing to your magnificence I have become accomplished in that vow of mine. [1-34-12]"
1-34-13,"Oh, dextrous Rama, this is all about my dynasty, my province on which we are presently camping namely the riverbanks of Sona, and about my birth, and thus everything is narrated as you have asked me. [1-34-13]"
1-34-14,"By telling these legends it is past midnight, oh, Kakutstha, you get some sleep. Safe you be! Let no hindrance occur for us halfway on our pathway. [1-34-14]"
1-34-15,"Oh, Raghu&#39;s delight, trees are standstill... animals and birds have slouched... nightly sombre has pervaded all the confines. [1-34-15]"
1-34-16,"Eventide lapsed slowly and the vault of heaven filled with stars and starlets is splendorous as though orbs of heaven are overspread on its vault. [1-34-16]"
1-34-17,"Also, dissipating the darkness of the world with his brilliance, the moon with coolant moonbeams is rising up, gladdening the hearts of worldly beings. [1-34-17]"
1-34-18,"Now, the bands of yaksha-s, demons, even the ferocious ogres that feed on raw flesh, why them, all the beings that take pleasure in nights are astir, far and wide. So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-34-18]"
1-34-19,"Saying so that greatly resplendent and eminent saint Vishvamitra paused, and then all the other sages have revered him saying, well-said, well-said. [1-34-19]"
1-34-20,"Sublime is this lineage of Kusha dynasty which always dedicated itself to righteousness, and the dynasty of Kusha are the best ones among mankind, and they symbolise with god Brahma himself, thus they are highly reverential. Thus the other sages have applauded Vishvamitra and his dynasty. [1-34-20]"
1-34-21,"You alone are exemplarily selfsame to Brahma, oh, Vishvamitra of great-renown, and among rivers that prominent River Kaushiki is your sister, thus she is glorifying your ancestry. Thus the sages lauded Vishvamitra. [1-34-21]"
1-34-22,"Sage Vishvamitra is pleased when those tigerly sages have laude him, and then that magnificent sage Vishvamitra lapsed into the lap of sleep, as the sun lapses into lap of dusk for that day. [1-34-22]"
1-34-23,"Even Rama with a little astonishment coming upon him, applauding that tigerly-sage, and glided into the lap of sleep along with Soumitri. [1-34-23]"
1-35-1,"On sojourning the remaining night on the bank of river Sona along with great-sages, Viswamitra spoke when that night is elapsing into a sunny daybreak. [1-35-1]"
1-35-2,"Oh, Rama, night fared into a sunny morning, eastern day-spring is set in, hence awake and arise, you be safe, ready yourself for further travel. [1-35-2]"
1-35-3,"On hearing the words of Sage Vishvamitra, Rama woke up and on completion of morning time religious activities he readied himself for further journey and indeed spoke this sentence to the sage. [1-35-3]"
1-35-4,"This River Sona is with auspicious waters and even adorned with dunes, where it is so deep. Oh, Brahman, in which of the two ways, namely by fordless waters or by fordable water with dunes, we have to cross this river? [1-35-4]"
1-35-5,"When Rama spoke to him thus sage Vishvamitra replied, I propose the same route by which these great sages are going. [1-35-5]"
1-35-6,"Thus spoken by that astute Sage Vishvamitra, the other great sages travelled on, indeed beholding diverse forests and their environs. [1-35-6]"
1-35-7,"On going a distance on their way, and after a lapse of half a day, then they perceived the prominent one among rivers and the one adored by sages, namely River Ganga. [1-35-7]"
1-35-8,"On seeing River Ganga with her pious waters and adored by swans and saarasa waterfowls, all the sages felt delighted together with both of the Raghava-s, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [1-35-8]"
1-35-9,"Then they sojourned on the riverbank of Ganga, and next on taking bath in Ganga they have customarily offered that river&#39;s water as oblations to their manes. After that, on enkindling the ritual-fire they have also offered fire-oblations into it for gods. Later, dining on their part of those ambrosian oblations with which they have oblated the fire, those sages perched on the propitious banks of Ganga, surrounding the great-souled Vishvamitra from all sides, to the contentment of their heart in having performed religious chores on the riverbank of Ganga. [1-35-9, 10, 11a]"
1-35-10,"When sages are sitting at ease then even Rama and Lakshmana sat down according to their admissibility and custom of sitting before their teachers, and then Rama highly gladdened at heart has spoken to Vishvamitra. [1-35-11]"
1-35-11,"Oh, godly sage, I wish to listen about Ganga, the river that has a trinal course, and as to how she is reaching the husband of rivulets and rivers, namely the ocean, on pervading all the three worlds. Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-35-12]"
1-35-12,"Motivated by Rama&#39;s words the eminent-sage Vishvamitra commenced to narrate about the emergence and that way even about the progression of River Ganga. [1-35-13]"
1-35-13,"The lordly mountain Himavan who is the greatest treasure trove of minerals, Rama, also treasures up a pair of daughters who by their comeliness are unequalled on earth. [1-35-14]"
1-35-14,"The slender-waisted and fascinating daughter of Mt. Meru, oh, Rama, renowned by her name Mena, is the dear wife of Himavan and the mother of those two daughters, indeed. [1-35-15]"
1-35-15,"This Ganga has emerged as an elder daughter to Himavan through Mena, oh, Raghava, and that way a girl renowned by the name Uma has become a second daughter to him. [1-35-16]"
1-35-16,"Later, all of the divinities intending to fulfil a divine purpose have sought the lordly mountain Himavan to spare Ganga, who is scheduled to become a tri-way-cruising river. [1-35-17]"
1-35-17,"With a righteous thinking and hopeful of the welfare in triadic world, Himavan then spared his daughter Ganga whose flow is at her own volition. [1-35-18]"
1-35-18,"Those divinities who are the well-wishers of the well-being of tri-world welcomed Ganga, who is incidentally intended for the purpose of the tri-world, and they came back to heaven fetching Ganga with them, with a heartfelt joy for their purpose is fulfilled. [1-35-19]"
1-35-19,"The other daughter of Himavanta, oh, Raghu&#39;s descendent, that unmarried girl namely Uma, she performed a rigorous sacrament taking hold of a supreme devoutness as her ascesis itself is her wealth. [1-35-20]"
1-35-20,"As for Uma who is unified with her rigorous sacrament and who is adored by all the world, that best one among mountains Himavanta gave such a daughter to the unique god Rudra. [1-35-21]"
1-35-21,"Oh, Raghava, the prominent one among rivers namely Ganga and Uma Devi as well, these are the two daughters of the king of mountains that are highly revered by the world. [1-35-22]"
1-35-22,"Dear boy Rama with beautiful gait, as to how the triply coursing Ganga has cruised to heaven in the first phase, I have related all about that cruise to you. [1-35-23]"
1-35-23,"As such, that marvellous and sinless daughter of the lordly mountain Himavanta, ever-flowing in the form of water, ascended to the abode of divinities and became <font color=""#B3003A"">devaganga</font> , Divine River. [1-35-24]"
1-36-1,"When that sage Vishvamitra has finished narration of the legend of the daughters of Himavanta, both the brave ones, namely Raghava and Lakshmana in their turn have extolled that legend and spoke to that eminent-sage. [1-36-1]"
1-36-2,"This admirable discourse given by you about Ganga is exhaustive in righteousness, oh, Brahman, and it will be apt of you to tell emphatically about the divine and earthly legend of the elder daughter of Himavanta, namely Ganga, for you are aware to expatiate upon it. [1-36-2]"
1-36-3,"By which reason that world purifier Ganga influxes into three paths? Oh, virtue-knower, and connected with which deeds of merit this triple-courser Ganga is renowned as the best one among all the rivers in three worlds? Thus Rama and Lakshmana have asked the sage Vishvamitra. [1-36-3, 4a]"
1-36-4,"When Kakutstha-s have enquired that way, the ascetically-wealthy sage Vishvamitra has narrated all the legend of Ganga in its entirety, staying among the sages. [1-36-4b, 5a]"
1-36-5,"On his getting married to Uma, oh, Rama, the sublime-ascetic and bluish throated god Shiva, as his throat became blue when he consumed poison during the churning of Milky Ocean, at one time with a predilection towards her he has started lovemaking with her. [1-36-5b, 6a]"
1-36-6,"While that sublime, sagacious and blue-throated God Shiva is in lovemaking, oh, enemy-scorcher Rama, a hundred divine years have elapsed, even then he had no son in her, namely Goddess Uma. [1-36-6b, c, 7]"
1-36-7,"All the gods headed by Brahma have then started to ponder, &#39;is there anybody who can inevitably sustain that being which emerges from this goddess Uma after this prolonged yogic act of copulation with Shiva?&#39; This being the worry of all gods they have prepared for action. [1-36-7b, 8a]"
1-36-8,"All of the gods on approaching and paying their deference to Shiva spoke this to him, &#39;oh, God of Gods, oh, one who is interested in the welfare of these worlds, oh, Great-God, considering the supplication of all gods it will be apt of you to bestow grace.&#39; [1-36-8b, 9]"
1-36-9," &#39;Worlds cannot capably bear your offspring born out of your effulgence, oh, Supreme-God, hence you may practice yogic asceticism along with your consort Goddess Uma in unison with Vedic postulates of Yoga, rather than progeniture, and desiring the welfare of the three worlds you may please retain your refulgent seed within your own radiance, thus protect this universe, since it will not be apt of you to render it devoid of worlds with the efflux of the unmanageable potence of yours .&#39; So said gods to Shiva. [1-36-10, 11]"
1-36-10,"On listening the words of gods that Rarefied-God of Universe, namely Shiva said, &#39;so be it,&#39; and further spoke this to all of the gods, indeed. [1-36-12]"
1-36-11," &#39;I wish to bear my sperm in my virility and Uma in hers, let the immortals and mortals as well, derive a perfect bliss. [1-36-13]"
1-36-12," &#39;But that part which has already stirred up from its place is irrestrainable, as such, oh gods of eminence, you tell me who can contain that part of the unexcelled potence.&#39; So said Shiva to gods. [1-36-14]"
1-36-13,"Thus spoken by Shiva, then the gods in reply spoke to him whose banner is Divine-Bull, namely Shiva, &#39;that part of the potence which has already stirred up, the earth indeed endures that now. [1-3-15]"
1-36-14,"Thus said by the gods that Yogi of par excellence and the God of Gods, Shiva, discharged his refulgent semen with which the earth together with its mountains and forests is overspread. [1-36-16]"
1-36-15,"Thereby the gods in their turn said even to Fire-god, &#39;you enter the great-potence of Rudra along with Wind-god, lest that potence may annihilate the earth and earthlings, because you can consume anything that comes in touch with you. [1-36-17]"
1-36-16,"And when Fire-god invaded that great-potence of Shiva it has emerged as White-mountain, also thus it has become as a divine forest of reeds equalling the Sun and Fire in its resplendence, wherefrom the highly brilliant Kumara has emerged. [1-36-18, 19a]"
1-36-17,"Later on, the gods together with the assemblages of sages are well pleased at heart as it has happened according to their prayer, thereby they fulsomely adored Shiva and even Uma. [1-36-19b, 20a]"
1-36-18,"Oh, Rama, but the daughter of Himalayan Mountain, namely Uma, while irefully saying this to the divinities she cursed them all with her eyes reddened in anger. [1-36-20b, 21a]"
1-36-19," &#39;Wherefore, I who am desirous of a son had been prevented from the intimacy with my husband, therefore you shall be infecund to beget progeny through your own wives. [1-36-21b, 22a]"
1-36-20," &#39;And from now onwards you wives shall remain infertile...&#39; and on saying this way to all of the gods she also gave a curse to the earth. [1-36-22, 23a]"
1-36-21," &#39;Oh, Earth, your appearance shall be bizarre and you will be a wife to many. And oh, verily base-minded earth, rendered sully by my anger you shall have no gratification caused by the children as you are bigoted against my son. [1-36-23b, 24]"
1-36-22,"That God of Gods Shiva becoming ill at ease to look at all of the distressed gods, equally feeling small to convince his consort Uma, he has started to journey towards the western quarter which is ruled by Rain-god. [1-36-25]"
1-36-23,"On going to the northern side of Himalayan Mountains, that God of Gods, Shiva settled down in ascesis along with his consort Uma on the peak of a mountain emerged from Himalayas. [1-36-26]"
1-36-24,"This is the legend of mountain&#39;s daughter, namely Goddess Uma vividly narrated to you, oh, Rama, and now listen from me along with Lakshmana about the emergence of Ganga. [1-36-27]"
1-37-1,"While god Shiva is undertaking ascesis thus, then the gods desiring an Army Chief for celestial forces have arrived in the audience of Forefather Brahma, along with Indra and keeping Fire-god at their fore. Sage Vishvamitra continued his narration to Rama. [1-37-1]"
1-37-2,"On approaching the Forefather Brahma, oh, Rama, all of the celestials headed by Fire-god and along with Indra have venerated and then spoke this to him. [1-37-2]"
1-37-3," &#39;Oh, god Brahma, he who has hypothetically given a Chief of Celestial Army in the form of his potence that god Shiva is undertaking a supreme ascesis, indeed along with Goddess Uma. [1-37-3]"
1-37-4," &#39;Looking forward for the welfare of the worlds, oh, knower of the procedures, Brahma, you may order us clearly what is to be done next, as you alone are our ultimate recourse. [1-37-4]"
1-37-5,"On listening the words of gods, Brahma, the Forefather of all the worlds, soothingly spoke this to the celestials with sweet words. [1-37-5]"
1-37-6," &#39;What the Daughter of Mountain, namely Goddess Uma, has said that &#39;you shall have no posterity in your own wives&#39; is true and it cannot be decried, and it is unambiguous too. [1-37-6]"
1-37-7," &#39;In whom the Fire-god can procreate an enemy-destroying Chief of Celestial Armies, such an empyreal Ganga is there. [1-37-7]"
1-37-8," &#39;The elder daughter King of Mountains, namely Ganga, will graciously welcome the offspring from Fire-god, and that act of Ganga in welcoming the offspring through Fire-god will also be pleasurable in many ways to the younger daughter of King of Mountains, namely Uma, no doubt about it.&#39; So said Brahma to all the gods. [1-37-8]"
1-37-9,"On hearing those words of Brahma, oh, Rama, the delight of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, all the gods have praisefully worshipped him, as their ends are achieved at the bidding fair of Brahma. [1-37-9]"
1-37-10,"On going to that supreme Mt. Kailash, oh, Rama, which is heaped up with many ores, all of those gods have assigned the Fire-god to father a son. [1-37-10]"
1-37-11," &#39;Oh, Fire-god, you please coordinate the mission of gods, oh, great-resplendent god of Fire, you may release the potence of Shiva, which you have contained so far, in the daughter of King of Mountains, namely River Ganga.&#39; Thus, all gods have requested the Fire-god. [1-37-11]"
1-37-12,"On assuring the gods that he will do his best, the Fire-god approached Ganga entreating, &#39;Oh, Goddess Ganga, you verily bear pregnancy with the potence of Shiva, since this is the select process of all the gods.&#39; So said Fire-god to River Ganga. [1-37-12]"
1-37-13,"On listening that sentence of Fire-god, River Ganga adopted a celestial form readying herself, and on seeing her glorious mien the Fire-god seeped throughout her. [1-37-13]"
1-37-14,"The Fire-god then drenched River Ganga from all over with the potence of Shiva which he contained so far, oh, Raghu&#39;s delight Rama, and every rill and channel of Ganga is replete with it. [1-37-14]"
1-37-15,"River Ganga then spoke this to the Fire-god who is in the lead of all gods, &#39;oh, god, I am incapable to bear up the rampant fervour of yours, and while being burnt with the fire of god Shiva compounded with that of yours my life-force is very highly tortured.&#39; [1-37-15, 16a]"
1-37-16,"He who consumes fire-oblations on behalf of all the gods, that Fire-god seeing the miserable condition of River Ganga then spoke this to her, &#39;&#39;you may lay away that embryo here at the side of Himalayan Mountains.&#39; So said Fire-god to River Ganga. [1-37-16b, 17a]"
1-37-17,"Oh, great-resplendent Rama, on hearing the words of Fire-god, oh, charming prince Rama, River Ganga indeed ejected that great-radiant embryo of Shiva from all her rills and channels. [1-37-17b, 18a]"
1-37-18,"Which refulgent embryo with the glitter of molten gold has emerged from River Ganga is there that has reached earth, and from that the silver, and even the gold with its matchless dazzle have emerged. [1-37-18]"
1-37-19,"In that process, copper and iron are also generated from that combustion of fires of Shiva and Fire-god, and the residua have become tin and lead, and thus that embryo on reaching the earth has evolved itself into various other elements also. [1-37-19b, 20]"
1-37-20,"But, just when that embryo is laid down on Himalayan mountains, entire reed-garden sprouted on that mountain is made brilliant by that glittering embryo and the reed-garden itself has become golden. [1-37-21]"
1-37-21,"Oh, tigerly-man, from then onwards the gold with its brilliance equalling that of the Fire-god is renowned by the name of <font color=""#B3003A"">jaataruupa</font> , one that retains its birth-time form, and oh, Raghava, everything on the mountain, say grass, trees, climbers, and shrubs, all have become golden. [1-37-22]"
1-37-22,"Then for the boy who took birth from the embryo deposited in Himalayas, the Wind-gods along with Indra have arranged Krittika stars to simultaneously suckle him. [1-37-23]"
1-37-23,"Those Krittika stars have decided among themselves that &#39;this boy shall be the son for all of us,&#39; and on making such a best resolve they suckled the just born boy. [1-37-24]"
1-37-24,"All the gods have then said, &#39;this boy will be renowned in all the three world as Kaarthikeya, as Krittika-stars have suckled him, with any doubt.&#39; [1-37-25]"
1-37-25,"On hearing that blessing of gods Krittika stars gave a wash to that excellently auspicious boy who is radiant like fire, and who slid down from the secretion of the womb of Ganga. [1-37-26]"
1-37-26,"And gods called that boy, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, whose glow is like that of flaring fire and who is ambidextrous as &#39;Skanda&#39; for he slid down from the secretions of a womb. [1-37-27]"
1-37-27,"Then an unexcelled milk instantly came forth from the breasts of the six Krittika-stars, and becoming a six-faced one that boy too sucked that milk from the six Krittika-stars at the same time. [1-37-28]"
1-37-28,"On sipping the milk just for one day he became an adolescent boy on that day itself, and even though he is of delicate constitution as a boy, that taskmaster triumphed over the army troops of demons by his own vigour. [1-37-29]"
1-37-29,"All of the celestial have then come together under the leadership of Fire-god and they anointed that highly resplendent boy, Skanda, or Kaarthikeya, as the Chief of Celestial Army troops. [1-37-30]"
1-37-30,"This way, I have vividly narrated the legend of Ganga to you, oh, Rama, like that the Divine and Meritorious legend of the emergence of Kumara, namely Skanda is also narrated. [1-37-31]"
1-37-31,"He who is a devotee of Kartikeyaa, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, he thrives with longevity, also with sons, grandsons on this humanly earth in his mortal life, and on its conclusion he becomes one with Skanda on journeying to Skanda&#39;s abode. [1-37-32]"
1-38-1,"Describing that legend of Kaartikeya to Rama, the descendent of Kaushi, namely sage Vishvamitra has further spoken this best sentence worded melodiously to Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha. [1-38-1]"
1-38-2,"Once there was a valiant and virtue-souled king of Ayodhya named Sagara, who is without offspring, as such he was longing for offspring. [1-38-2]"
1-38-3,"The daughter of King of Vidarbha, renowned by name Keshini, is the eldest wife of Sagara, and she was virtue-minded, and an advocate of truth. [1-38-3]"
1-38-4,"The daughter of Arishtanemi, namely sage Kashyapa, and who is also the sister of Garuda, the Divine-Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu, is the second wife of Sagara, who is known by the name Sumati. [1-38-4]"
1-38-5,"<em>Reaching the Himalayan Mountains along with his two wives that great King Sagara practised asceticism on a mountain called Brugu-prsravana for progeny. [1-38-5]</em>"
1-38-6,"On completion of a hundred years of ascesis, and when the Sage Bhrugu is worshipped with asceticism, that sage who is a prominent one among the patrons of truth bestowed a boon to Sagara. [1-38-6]"
1-38-7,"<em> &#39;Oh, merited one, you will achieve very admirable progeny, and oh, best one among men, you will also acquire an unparalleled renown in the world. [1-38-7]</em>"
1-38-8," &#39;One of your wives will mother a son who enriches your dynasty, oh, dear sire, and the other mothers sixty thousand sons.&#39; Said Sage Bhrigu to Sagara. [1-38-8]"
1-38-9,"Highly gladdened are the daughters of kings of Vidarbha and Aristanemi, i.e., the queens of Sagara, and on making palm-fold in supplication at the sage who is speaking that way, and on gaining the grace of that sage they spoke to him. [1-38-9]"
1-38-10," &#39;Which of us will carry one son, oh, Brahma-sage, and which of us begets numerous sons, we two wish to listen about that, oh, Brahman, let your word betide truth.&#39; Thus, the queens of Sagara spoke to the sage. [1-38-10]"
1-38-11,"On listening their words the Sage Bhrigu spoke in a glorious tone, &#39;let your freewill be brought to bear this issue&#39;. [1-38-11]"
1-38-12," &#39;Whether one wants one son who enriches dynasty, or whether numerous sons who will be highly energetic, highly renowned, and highly enthusiastic. Who wants which boon from either of them?&#39; Thus, the Sage gave them the option. [1-38-12]"
1-38-13,"On listening the words of the sage, oh, Rama, oh, delighter of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, the first queen Keshini has chosen one son who enriches the dynasty in the presence of King Sagara. [1-38-13]]"
1-38-14,"Sumati, the sister of mighty-winged Garuda and the second queen of Sagara has then chosen sixty thousand sons with great enthusiasm and high reputation. [1-38-14]"
1-38-15,"On performing circumambulations to the Sage Bhrigu along with wives, oh, Raghu&#39;s scion, also on reverencing him head-bent, the king Sagara proceeded to his own city. [1-38-15]"
1-38-16,"When the time rolled by then the elder wife Keshini gave birth to the son of Sagara who is reputed by the name Asamanja. [1-38-16]"
1-38-17,"But the second queen Sumati on part, oh, tigerly-man Rama, verily delivered a round and long egg which is like a single gourd, and on breaking it up sixty thousand sons are issued forth from that cucumber like egg. [1-38-17]"
1-38-18,"The childminders brought up those siblings in vessels filled with ghee, the clarified butter, and after a protracted time all of the children have attained youthfulness. [1-38-18]"
1-38-19,"After a long time the sixty thousand sons of king Sagara have become youthful, and handsome in their aspects. [1-38-19]"
1-38-20,"But, oh, best one among men, oh, Rama, the elder son of the king Sagara, namely Asamanja, always used to grab and hurl children into the waters of River Sarayu, and on seeing the drowning children he used to enjoy with laughter. [1-38-20, 21a]"
1-38-21,"This way, when that son Asamanja is with sinister activity, a torturer of goodmen, and delighter in the undesirable activities towards citizens, his father king Sagara expatriated him from the city. [1-38-21b, 22a]"
1-38-22,"But Asamanja&#39;s son is a valorous one, who by name is Anshuman, and who is an acceptable one for all people and who fondly converses with all. [1-38 -22b, 23a]"
1-38-23,"Oh, best one among men, Rama, then after along time a decided thought has occurred to king Sagara that, &#39;I shall perform a Vedic-ritual.&#39;[1-38-23b, 24a]"
1-38-24,"That king Sagara who is an expert in Vedic-procedures has then taken a decision along with the assemblages of his religious-teachers insofar as the procedures of the ritual are concerned, and he commenced to perform the Vedic-ritual. [1-38-24b, c]"
1-39-1,"On listening the narration of Vishvamitra, Rama, the delighter of Raghu&#39;s dynasty is highly rejoiced, and at the end of the episode he spoke to sage whose glow is fire like. [1-39-1]"
1-39-2,"I am interested to listen this episode exhaustively, oh, Brahman, let good betide you, how my ancestor Sagara had completed the Vedic-ritual, really. [1-39-2]"
1-39-3,"On listening the words of Rama that are inclusive of his inquisitiveness, Sage Vishvamitra smilingly spoke to that descendent of Kakutstha, oh, Rama, let the episode of the great-souled Sagara be listened vividly. Vishvamitra thus commenced to narrate that episode. [1-39-3, 4a]"
1-39-4,"The father-in-law of god Shankara who is well-known by the name of Himavan sets eyes on Mt. Vindhya, which stands as loftily as Himalayas, and those two mountains peer at each other. [1-39-4b, 5a]"
1-39-5,"Oh, best one among men, Rama, that Vedic-ritual of Sagara started in between those two mountains, namely Himalayas and Vindhya ranges, and oh, tigerly-man Rama, that area is renowned for Vedic-rituals, isn&#39;t it! [1-39-5b, 6a]"
1-39-6,"Oh, dear sire Rama, the grandson of Sagara and the son of exiled Asamanja is Amshuman, oh, descendant of Kakutstha, which Anshuman&#39;s bow will be unfaltering and who is a top-speeded chariot-rider, and he has escorted ritual-horse released. [1-39-6b, 7a]"
1-39-7,"And on the day of a sacred function called <font color=""#B3003A"">ukthyam</font> , Indra assumed the form of a demon and stole the ritual horse of the chief of the ritual, namely Sagara. [1-39-7b, 8a]"
1-39-8,"While that ritual-horse of the great-souled Sagara is stolen, all the congregations of the Ritviks, the religious-teachers, then spoke to the chief propitiator, namely Sagara. [1-39-8b, 9a]"
1-39-9,"&#39;Oh, Sagara,the descendent of Kakutstha, at this auspicious time the ritual horse is hastily diverted, you kill him who stole the horse, and let that horse be fetched&#39;. [1-39-9b, 10a]"
1-39-10,"&#39;This hindrance in Vedic-ritual will become inauspicious for all of us, thereby, oh, king, action may be taken as to how there can be no fault in proceedings of the ritual.&#39; The religious-teachers of Sagara have advised him in this way. [1-39-10b, 11a]"
1-39-11,"On hearing the words of religious-teachers that king Sagara indeed spoke this much to his sixty thousand sons in that religious-council. [1-39-11b, 12a]"
1-39-12,"&#39;Oh, sons, I do not envisage any way in for demons into this ritual, since oh, best ones among men, holy-sanctifiers who themselves are sanctified by the Vedic-hymns are conducting this glorious Vedic-ritual, isn&#39;t it. [1-39-12b, 13a]"
1-39-13,"&#39;Oh, sons, you may therefore proceed to search for the horse and its thief on entire earth as far as it is garlanded by the ocean, and safety betides you all. [1-39-13]"
1-39-14,"&#39;Oh, sons, let each prince advance searching one square yojana of earth, by my order you dig up the earth until the appearance of the horse, while searching for the stealer of that horse. [1-39-14b, 15]"
1-39-15,"&#39;As for myself, I will stay here only along with my grandson, namely Amshuman, and with the congregation of religious-teachers till the horse appears, as I am under vow of the ritual.&#39; Thus Sagara instructed to his sixty thousand sons and stayed back at the ritual place. [1-39-16]"
1-39-16,"Animated by their father&#39;s words those great-mighty princes enthusiastically proceeded onto earth&#39;s surface in the preliminary round of search. [1-39-1]"
1-39-17,"But, oh, tigerly-man Rama, on going round the earth in its entirety those great-mighty princes did not find that horse, then as said by their father they mapped the earth to a unit of one square yojana for each of them, and each of them hollowed out each and every area on the surface of earth with their arms that have the touch of the diamonds. [1-39-18]"
1-39-18,"Mother Earth bewailed while she is ruptured with spears also that are similar to thunderbolts, besides with very gruelling ploughs. [1-39-19]"
1-39-19,"Oh, Raghava, there emerged an unbearable rumpus from the serpents, asura-s, demons, and other beings living underneath the surface of earth, while they are killed during hollowing the earth. [1-39-20]"
1-39-20,"Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, thus sixty thousand square yojana-s of the earth is dug over, so as to make the earth&#39;s outermost plane as the unsurpassed <font color=""#B3003A"">rasaatala</font>, the sixth subterranean and the nethermost plane. [1-39-21]"
1-39-21,"Oh, the tigerly king Rama, the sons of Sagara have endeavoured everywhere digging over the Jambu Island which is verily congested with mountains in this way. [1-39-22]"
1-39-22,"All the gods along with gandharva-s, asura-s, and reptiles who are distraught at heart for the plight of earth have approached the Forefather, Brahma. [1-39-23]"
1-39-23,"They the gods who are very highly scared, and who are chap-fallen, then spoke this sentence to the great-souled Forefather Brahma on gaining his grace. [1-39-24]"
1-39-24,"&#39;Oh, god Brahma, the sons of Sagara are digging entire earth, thus aquatic beings and many great-souls are being destroyed. [1-39-25]"
1-39-25,"             &#39;This one is the destroyer of our ritual... this one has carried off our ritual horse...&#39; thinking thus and suspecting everyone those sons of Sagara are torturing all the living beings.&#39; Thus all the gods have appealed to Brahma. So said Sage Vishvamitra to Rama and others. [1-39-26]"
1-40-1,"On hearing the words of gods, the esteemed Forefather Brahma spoke to them, who are very highly scared, and bewildered by the might of Sagara&#39;s sons for they are effectuating the end of all beings. Vishvamitra thus continued his narration. [1-40-1]"
1-40-2,"To whom this Mother Earth belongs in all her entirety, he is that prescient Vasudeva, and she is also the consort of that Maadhava, and that Vishnu eternally props up Mother Earth. Hence, that reverential Vishnu donning the semblance of Sage Kapila will burn down the sons of emperor Sagara to ashes in a fire of fury. [1-40-2, 3]"
1-40-3,"&#39;Even the complete cleavage of the earth, and the complete ruination of Sagara&#39;s sons as well, are envisaged by the providentially farsighted ancients. So said Brahma to gods. [1-40-4]"
1-40-4,"On hearing the words of the Forefather Brahma all the thirty three gods went away with utmost satisfaction, as they have came. [1-40-5]"
1-40-5,"When the sons of Sagara are digging the earth then there emerged an unbearable noise similar to the crashing of a thunder. [1-40-6]"
1-40-6,"Then on hollowing the entire earth, and on making trips around her without finding the horse, all of the sons of Sagara have come together and on going to their father they spoke these words to him. [1-40-7]"
1-40-7,"&#39;Entire earth is trekked and mighty beings like gods, demons, monsters, evil-spirits, fiends, serpents, naga-s are also eliminated, but we have not seen the ritual-horse or its stealer. What we have to do next. Let a thought be given in this matter. Let safeness betide you.&#39; So said those princes to their father Sagara. [1-40-8, 9]"
1-40-8,"On hearing that sentence of his sons, oh, Rama, descendent of Raghu, that exalted king Sagara infuriately spoke these words. [1-40-10]"
1-40-9,"&#39;Let the earth be dug further, may safety be with you, and verily splitting open the surface of the earth you catch hold of the thief of the horse, and on achieving your purpose you may return to me.&#39; In this way Sagara ordered his sons. [1-40-11]"
1-40-10,"On catching up the words of their father, the great-souled Sagara,             his sixty thousand sons rushed towards the surface of the <strong>rasaatala</strong>,             the netherworld. [1-40-12]"
1-40-11,"While digging the earth there they beheld a mountain similar easterly elephant named Viruupaaksha, which is bearing the eastern side of earth&#39;s surface on its head. [1-40-13]"
1-40-12,"Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that great easterly elephant Viruupaaksha is bearing the entire eastern earth along with its mountains and forests on its head. [1-40-14]"
1-40-13,"On certain occasions, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, when that great-elephant moves its head desiring respite in tiresomeness then earthquakes will occur on earth. [1-40-15]"
1-40-14,"They circumambulated the great elephant in supplication, oh Rama, and on worshipping that elephant which is the protector of easterly direction they proceeded to netherworld duly splitting the earth. [1-40-16]"
1-40-15,"After splitting the eastern direction then they split opened the southern direction, and even in southern direction they beheld an elephant that is similar to a very great mountain, and that is sustaining southerly side of earth on its head, and on seeing that mammoth elephant of venerable character, namely Mahapadma, they went into an inordinate astonishment. [1-40-17, 18]"
1-40-16,"On circumabulating that elephant Mahaapada in supplication, they the sixty thousand sons of great-souled Sagara scooped out the westerly direction. [1-40-19]"
1-40-17,"Even in the westerly direction those great mighty sons of Sagara beheld an infinite and mountain similar elephant of western direction, called Sumanasa. [1-40-20]"
1-40-18,"Circumambulating that elephant namely Sumanasa in western side, and even on asking about its well-being, then they reached the northern direction duly digging the earth. [1-40-21]"
1-40-19,"In the northern direction, oh, Rama, they beheld Bhadra, a snow-white elephant with an auspicious body bearing northern side of this earth. [1-40-22]"
1-40-20,"On touching that elephant reverently and also circumambulating it, those sixty thousands sons of Sagara further burrowed to the surface of the earth. [1-40-23]"
1-40-21,"The sons of Sagara have then gone to the auspicious northeast direction,<font color=""#B3003A"">iishaana-digbhaaga, Shiva-sthaana</font>, and all those sons of Sagara have tunnelled the earth rancorously. [1-40-24]"
1-40-22,"But all those great-souled and great-mighty ones with terrible dash have seen the Infinite Vasudeva in the form of sage Kapila there in the northeast, and oh, descendant of Raghu, they have also seen the ritual-horse moving nearby that sage Kapila, thus all of the sons of Sagara obtained a matchless delight. [1-40-25, 26]"
1-40-23,"The eyes of the princes are agitated in fury in construing the sage Kapila as the stealer of ritual-horse, and they furiously dashed towards him wielding crowbars, ploughs, and various trees and boulders, and shouting at him, &#39;stay, stay.&#39; [1-40-27, 28a]"
1-40-24,"You the malicious one, you have indeed stolen our ritual-horse, and in fact, you should know that we who arrived here are the sons of Sagara.&#39; Thus Sagara&#39;s sons shouted at sage Kapila. [1-40-28b, 29a]"
1-40-25,"On hearing their words, oh, Rama, the descendant of Raghu, then sage Kapila is beset with high wrath, and he boomed a &#39;hum&#39; sound at them. [1-40-29b, 30a]"
1-40-26,"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, then that great-souled sage Kapila, rather Vishnu with unimaginable power, has rendered all of those sons of Sagara as heaps of ashes by virtue of his &#39;hum&#39; sound. Thus Sage Vishvamitra is narrating the legend of Sagara to Rama and others. [1-40-30b, c]"
1-41-1,"On observing that his sons have gone long time back in search of ritual-horse, oh, Rama, king Sagara spoke this to his grandson, Amshuman, who is radiant with his own self-resplendence. Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about Sagara. [1-41-1]"
1-41-2,"&#39;You are brave one and completed your education in warfare, such as you are, you are a coequal to your paternal-uncles in magnificence, thus you search the course of your paternal uncles, also him by whom the horse is stolen.&#39; Thus King Sagara started speaking to his grandson Amshuman. [1-41-2]"
1-41-3,"The living beings in netherworlds of earth are intrepid and they are extraordinary also, hence you take your bow along with your sword to retaliate them in the event of their attacking you. [1-41-3]"
1-41-4,"&#39;On saluting them that are worthy for salutations, and on eliminating them that are the causer of obstructions, you shall achieve your purpose of tracking the ritual-horse, and thus you comeback safely and let my Vedic-ritual be crossed over to the other shore of mortality by you.&#39; Thus king Sagara told his grandson Amshuman. [1-41-4]"
1-41-5,"When the great-souled king Sagara has thoroughly said in this way, that adroitly agile Amshuman proceeded wielding a bow and a sword. [1-41-5]"
1-41-6,"Motivated by the King Sagara, oh, Rama, the best one among men, Amshuman progressed on the walkway that was hollowed out by his great-souled paternal-uncles inside the earth. [1-41-6]"
1-41-7,"And he that resplendent Amshuman beheld one of the four directional elephant of the earth which is being venerated by gods, monsters, demons, imps, vultures and serpents. [1-41-7]"
1-41-8,"On circumambulating that elephant in supplication, and even on enquiring after its well-being, he that Amshuman has enquired in detail with it for his paternal-uncles and even about the robber of the ritual-horse. [1-41-8]"
1-41-9,"On hearing that enquiry of Amshuman that directional elephant with great perception replied on its part saying, &#39;oh Amshuman, son of Asamanja, on achieving your mission you will return expeditiously along with the horse&#39;. [1-41-9]"
1-41-10,"On hearing that word of that directional elephant he departed from there, and on sequentially reaching other directional elephants that are abiding in other directions of earth, he commenced to ask the same enquiry which he made with the first, according to the positioning of elephants in directions, and according to the established procedures of their venerability. [1-41-10]"
1-41-11,"All the elephants that safeguard the directions of earth which have the faculties of articulation and eloquence have adored Amshuman and motivated him by saying, &#39;you will be going from here taking the horse.&#39; [1-41-11]"
1-41-12,"On hearing that common blessing of all the directional-elephants, he that nimble-footed Amshuman has gone to the place where his paternal-uncles, sons of Sagara, were rendered as mounds of ashes. [1-41-12]"
1-41-13,"But he on whom the control of anguish has chanced for not physically seeing his paternal-uncles, that son of Asamanja then wept, as he is highly agonised and extremely anguished at their destruction. [1-41-13]"
1-41-14,"That tigerly-man Amshuman who is overwhelmed by agony and anguish, also beheld there the horse of Vedic-ritual that is grazing nearby. [1-41-14]"
1-41-15,"When he that great resplendent Amshuman wanted to offer obsequial waters to the departed sons of Sagara and searched for water he has not found any fount of water. [1-41-15]"
1-41-16,"Spanning his expert glances, oh, Rama, he then saw the rapid-winged king of birds, namely Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu, who is the maternal uncle of his father and other paternal-uncles, and whose flight will be similar to that of the Wind-god. [1-41-16]"
1-41-17,"That great-mighty son of Lady Vinata, namely Garuda, also spoke this word to Amshuman, &#39;do not bemoan, oh, tigerly-man, this eradication of your paternal-uncles is worthwhile to the worlds&#39;. [1-41-17]"
1-41-18,"In fact, Kapila, the Imponderable Sage, has burnt down those great-mighty paternal-uncles of yours, oh, observant Amshuman, as such it will not be apt of you to offer the mundane obsequial water-oblations to them, indeed. [1-41-18]"
1-41-19,"&#39;Oh, best one among men, River Ganga is the elder daughter of Himavanta, and oh, dextrous one, you have to offer water-oblation to the departed paternal-uncles of yours in her waters, namely the holy waters of River Ganga&#39;. [1-41-19]"
1-41-20,"World purifier River Ganga will drift them who are rendered as mounds of ashes to heaven, and when she who is much adored by all worlds drenches this ash, that River Ganga herself will lead the sixty-thousand sons of Sagara to heaven. [1-41-20]"
1-41-21,"&#39;Oh, great fortunate one, oh, best one among men, you may proceed from here with the horse, oh, brave one, it will be apt of you to carry out the Vedic-ritual of your grandfather.&#39; Thus Garuda said to Amshuman. [1-41-21]"
1-41-22,"On hearing the words of that great-winged eagle, Garuda, he that highly brave and well-renowned Amshuman swiftly took the horse, and returned to the ritual place of his grandfather, king Sagara. [1-41-22]"
1-41-23,"Then on reaching the King Sagara, who is under the vow of the ritual, oh, Rama, Amshuman described what all has happened and even the words of Garuda. [1-41-23]"
1-41-24,"On hearing those unendurable words from Amshuman, the king Sagara firstly completed the Vedic-ritual scripturally and procedurally. [1-41-24]"
1-41-25,"On completing the Vedic-ritual King Sagara arrived at his capital, but that king could not arrive at a decision about the arrival of Ganga to the earth. [1-41-25]"
1-41-26,"That great king Sagara could not get at any resolve in getting Ganga to earth even after a long time, and on ruling kingdom for thirty-thousand years he went to heaven. Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about the ancestors of Rama. [1-41-26]"
1-42-1,"When King Sagara passed away owing to the irrefutable virtue of Time, the ministers and subjects of that kingdom are predisposed towards the highly honourable Amshuman to become their king and they enthroned him accordingly. Thus Vishvamitra continued narration about the predecessors of Rama. [1-42-1]"
1-42-2,"He that Amshuman turned out to be a very great king, and oh, Rama of Raghu&#39;s delight, he begot a marvellous son who is renowned as Dileepa. [1-42-2]"
1-42-3,"Assigning the kingdom to Dileepa, oh, Rama of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, Amshuman undertook very stern ascesis on a pleasant peak of Himalayas desiring the descent of River Ganga to earth. [1-42-3]"
1-42-4,"On practising ascesis in ascetic-woods for thirty-two thousand years that highly renowned king Amshuman achieved heaven as he acquired only the wealth of practising the ascesis. [1-42-4]"
1-42-5,"The great resplendent Dileepa on hearing the elimination of his grandfathers, the sixty thousand sons of Sagara at the hand of sage Kapila, and with a mind that is marred by the plight of his father Amshuman in absolving the souls of Sagara&#39;s sons, he that Dileepa could not arrive at any decision concerning the descent of Ganga. [1-42-5]"
1-42-6,"Dileepa became worried as to how River Ganga is to be alighted onto earth from heaven, how water-oblations are to be offered for the souls of Sagara&#39;s sons, and how to cross them, the souls, over this mortal world. [1-42-6]"
1-42-7,"To him who is self-mortified and who is always thinking righteously about the alight of Ganga onto earth, to such a Dileepa a most-virtuous son is born who is renowned by his name Bhageeratha. [1-42-7]"
1-42-8,"That great-resplendent king Dileepa on his part performed numerous Vedic-rituals, and he ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years - to the delight of each of his subjects, but could not find a way to fetch Ganga. [1-42-8]"
1-42-9,"Oh, tigerly-man Rama, that king Dileepa by not attaining any choice towards the uplifting the souls of his grandparents to heaven by bringing Ganga to earth, he took to illness, and he attained the ultimate virtue of Time, namely the demise. [1-42-9]"
1-42-10,"That best one among men, namely king Dileepa, on anointing his son Bhageeratha in the kingdom went to the abode of Indra, namely the heaven, only by his self-acquired merits of deeds. [1-42-10]"
1-42-11,"Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, but on his part that self-righteous and kingly-sage Bhageeratha is childless, and that great king longed-for offspring. [1-42-11]"
1-42-12,"Interested in the alighting of River Ganga on earth, oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, king Bhageeratha delegated his kingdom to the custody of his ministers and people and firmed up himself in sustained asceticism on Mt. Gokarna in Himalayas, and he practise ascesis standing amid five-fires, upraising his hands, with a monthly sustenance and with his sense conquered. [1-42-12, 13a]"
1-42-13,"Thousands of years have rolled by while Bhageeratha stood practising his severe ascesis, oh, dextrous Rama, and then the lord and master of all beings, namely god Brahma, is well pleased with that great-souled king&#39;s ascesis. [1-42-13b, 14]"
1-42-14,"Forefather Brahma then arrived along with assemblages of gods, and spoke this way to the great-souled Bhageeratha who is deep in the practise of ascesis. [1-42-15]"
1-42-15,"  Oh, great king Bhageeratha, oh, lord of the people, I am delighted with the perfectly conducted ascesis of yours, hence oh, truly committed one, you may beseech for a boon. [1-42-16]"
1-42-16,"That great resplendent and highly fortunate king Bhageeratha then remaining with suppliantly adjoined palm fold spoke to him who is the Forefather of all worlds, namely Brahma. [1-42-17]"
1-42-17,"Oh, god, if you are satisfied with my ascesis, and if there is any fruition to the ascesis of mine, let all the sons of Sagara get water oblations through me. [1-42-18]"
1-42-18,"While the ashes of these great souls are drenched with the waters of Ganga, let all of those great-grandfathers of mine depart to heaven, eternally. [1-42-19]"
1-42-19,"Oh, god, I indeed pray for offspring in our Ikshvaku dynasty, let not our dynasty dwindle as I am issueless, and oh, god, let this be the other boon to me. [1-42-20]"
1-42-20,"The Forefather of all the worlds, Brahma, then replied the king who has spoken in that way, in an auspicious tongue that is sweet-sounding and sweetly worded, as well. [1-42-21]"
1-42-21,"Oh, top-speeded chariot-rider Bhageeratha, this aspiration of yours is sublime, and oh, the furtherer of Ikshvaku dynasty, so be it, let safeness betide you. [1-42-22]"
1-42-22,"This Ganga is the one with snow-broth, the elder daughter of Himavanta, and oh, king Bhageeratha, god Shiva alone is capable to sustain her force in the course of her alighting onto earth, and in fact, he is to be commissioned for that purpose. [1-42-23]"
1-42-23,"&#39;Oh, king Bhageeratha, the earth cannot endure the downfall of Ganga and to sustain Ganga, oh, king, indeed I do not behold none other than the Trident-wielder, god Shiva.&#39; Thus Brahma spoke to Bhageeratha. [1-42-24]"
1-42-24,"Speaking this way to the king Bhageeratha and informally greeting Ganga also, that Creator of Worlds, Brahma, left for heaven along with all the groups of gods and Wind-gods. Thus Vishvamitra continued narration about the arrival of River Ganga to earth. [1-42-25]"
1-43-1,"When the god of gods Brahma left from there Bhageeratha stood on the tip of his big-toe praying for the mercy of Lord Shiva for one year, while that tip of his big-toe pressurised the earth. Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about Bhageeratha&#39;s effort to bring Ganga to earth. [1-43-1]"
1-43-2,"On completion of one year, he who is venerated by all worlds, the consort of Uma and the god of animals from insects to humans, that god Shiva revealed himself and spoke this to the king. [1-43-2]"
1-43-3,"Oh, best one among humans, I am delighted with your unwavering effort, and I will fulfil your cherish. I will therefore sustain Ganga, the daughter of king of mountains by my head. [1-43-3]"
1-43-4,"Afterwards, she who is reverenced by all the worlds and who is the elder daughter of Himavanta, that Ganga assuming an unendurable form and an insupportable rapidity, they say, then plunged from the sky onto the auspicious head of Shiva. [1-43-4, 5a]"
1-43-5,"She who is an extremely unendurable river that goddess Ganga even speculated saying to herself, &#39;let me enter netherworld, indeed whisking Shiva with my streams.&#39; [1-43-5b, 6a]"
1-43-6,"Discerning her egotism god Shiva is infuriated, and then on his part that Three-eyed god Shiva thought to pent her up in the tufts of his head-hair. [1-43-6b, 7a]"
1-43-7,"And oh, Rama, she that holy River Ganga swooped down into the cavernous curls of matted hair-tufts on the holy head of God Shiva, and she became a detainee in them. [1-43-7b, 8a]"
1-43-8,"Though she strove hard in one way or another to reach the earth that Ganga is rendered incapable, as she could not gain access for an outlet from any edge of the coils of matted hair-tufts of Shiva, hence she is held there in durance vile. [1-43-8b, 9a]"
1-43-9,"Goddess Ganga whirled round and round in the coils of tufts alone for many number of years, and when Ganga&#39;s emanation from those coils is intangible Bhageeratha again firmed up in a marvellous penance in the matter of her descent to earth. [1-43-9b, 10a]"
1-43-10,"Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, with that ascesis of Bhageeratha god Shiva is very much delighted, and thereupon he has also released Ganga aiming at Bindu Lake in Himalayas. [1-43-10b, 11a]"
1-43-11,"While god Shiva released Ganga into Bindu Lake seven streams have emerged out of it, and thus three auspicious Ganga-s with holy waters have cruised eastward which are known as Hlaadini, Paavani, and Nalini. [1-43-11b, 12]"
1-43-12,"Also thus Sucakshu, Seetha, and the excellent river Sindhu are the other three rivers which streamed to the westward direction with their holy waters. [1-43-13]"
1-43-13,"Of them the seventh Ganga flowed towards the path of Bhageeratha&#39; chariot, and that great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting in a divine chariot moved ahead and even Ganga followed him. [1-43-14, 15a]"
1-43-14,"Thus Ganga came from heavens onto Shankara&#39;s head and from there onto the earth, and there on earth her waters advanced with a tumultuous sound advancing them. [1-43-15b, 16a]"
1-43-15,"The earth then verily shone forth with the shoals of fish, schools of tortoises, and scores of porpoises and other aquatic beings that have already fallen and that are still falling in step with the spates of Ganga. [1-43-16b, 17a]"
1-43-16,"Later, they the gods, sages, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, and the assemblages of siddha-s have then seen there the swoop of Ganga in that way from heaven to earth, with curiosity. [1-43-17b, 18a]"
1-43-17,"Some of the gods with aircrafts that are like cities in their shape and size, and some with horses that are prancing, and some with best elephants that are staggering, at the very sight of plunging Ganga, have entered the firmament at that place. [1-43-18b, 19a]"
1-43-18,"The gods whose animation is unlimited, and who are anxious to see the plunge of Ganga, have come together in assemblages, which plunge is a highest marvel in the universe by a better degree of her illimitable animation than that of gods who came to see, and even benignant to the world in according water and salving souls, which those gods cannot do. [1-43-19b, 20a]"
1-43-19,"The glitter of the ornaments of hosts of gods who are in stampede, made the cloudless sky to shine as if it is with a hundred of suns. [1-43-20b, 21a]"
1-43-20,"At that time, with the falling and rising of scores of porpoises and reptiles, even with the wriggling fishes, the sky became flashy as if flashes of lightning are strewn over it. [1-43-21b, 22a]"
1-43-21,"Spattered innumerably with the whitish froth from the splashes of Ganga, and stippled with the flights of swans, the sky is as though overspread with silver-clouds of autumn. [1-43-22b, 23a]"
1-43-22,"Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately, elsewhere sinuously, somewhere else straightly, elsewhere sloppily, somewhere gushingly, and somewhere else her cruise is leisurely and tardily. [1-43-23b, 24a]"
1-43-23,"Somewhere Ganga is coursing precipitately in declivities, elsewhere sinuously on zigzag lands, somewhere else straightly on uniform lands, elsewhere sloppily in canting lands, somewhere gushingly in craggy lands, and somewhere else her cruise is leisurely in flatlands and tardily in uplands."
1-43-24,"Somewhere her water repeatedly knocking against her own water is recurrently billowing upwards only to make nosedive onto earth. [1-43-24b, 25a]"
1-43-25,"That impeccable and immaculate water of Ganga then became outstanding as it has flounced down from heaven primarily onto the head of Shankara, and therefrom it has coasted down onto the earth. [1-43-25b, 26a]"
1-43-26,"And asserting that the water as holy, because it descended touching the body of Shiva, viz., the head of Shiva, the assemblages of sages, gandharva-s, and those that are residents on the plane of earth have sipped that water at that place. [1-43-26b, 27a]"
1-43-27,"Also those that have fallen from heaven onto the surface of earth by some curse or the other, they too became blemishless on taking head-bath in the water of Ganga. [1-43-27b, 28a]"
1-43-28,"When sins are washed away with the hallowing water of Ganga, they again transited skyward and then obtained their own empyrean worlds once again. [1-43-28b, 29a]"
1-43-29,"With her splendorous water people are blissful, and on taking dip-baths in Ganga they are totally removed of the strains of their sins, and they lived blissfully ever after. [1-43-29b, 30a]"
1-43-30,"In this way, the great-resplendent and kingly sage Bhageeratha sitting in a divine chariot continuously moved ahead and Ganga continually followed him at his behind. [1-43-30b, 31a]"
1-43-31,"Oh, Rama, all of the gods along with the assemblages of sages, ogres, monsters, demons, and even great reptiles with kinnara-s, and gandharva-s with best yaksha-s, and even serpents and apsara-s, have delightfully moved after Ganga who is following the chariot of Bhageeratha, and why they, in fact, all of the aquatic beings have followed Ganga. [31b, 32, 33a]"
1-43-32,"In whichever direction king Bhageeratha has advanced, that glorious River Ganga, who is the prominent river among all the rivers and the complete obliterator of sins, has also moved at his behind in that direction. [1-43-33b, 34a]"
1-43-33,"While in flow she started to completely inundate the field of Vedic-ritual belonging to the great-souled sage Jahnu, who is of marvellous deeds and who is presently an officiator of an ongoing Vedic-ritual. [1-43-34b, 35a]"
1-43-34,"But on knowing her hubris, oh, Raghava, that sage Jahnu has become irritated and causing an extreme marvel he drank off all the water of Ganga. [1-43-35b, 36a]"
1-43-35,"Thereupon, the gods along with gandharva-s and sages at that extremely marvellous feat of Sage Jahnu are highly astounded, and they then started to worship that ablest human and great-souled sage Jahnu, and even deigned for the daughterhood of Ganga to that high-souled sage Jahnu. [1-43-36b, 37]"
1-43-36,"That greatly radiant and godly sage Jahnu is then delighted and released Ganga from both of his ears. Therefore Ganga became the daughter of sage Jahnu, and she is also renowned as Jahnavi, after the name of that sage. [1-43-38]"
1-43-37,"Even though Ganga again proceeded moving behind the chariot of Bhageeratha and reached the ocean, therefrom she had to wend her way to netherworld, once dug by the sons of Sagara, only to accomplish the mission of Bhageeratha, namely drenching the ashes of Sagara&#39;s sons. [1-43-39, 40a]"
1-43-38,"Even kingly-sage Bhageeratha making every effort ushered Ganga to netherworld, but on seeing his grandparents rendered to ashes he has became doleful. [1-43-40b, 41a]"
1-43-39,"Oh, Rama, the best of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, then Ganga inundated that mound of ashes of Sagara&#39;s six-thousand sons, by which those souls obtained heaven, while the sins of souls are cleansed with the water of Ganga. Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-43-41b, c]"
1-44-1,"            King Bhageeratha followed by Ganga has gone to the ocean-like ditch which is dredged up by the sons of Sagara, and entered the subterranean of earth where the sons of Sagara are rendered to ashes. Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about the Descent of Ganga. [1-44-1]"
1-44-2,"While the waters of Ganga are inundating those ashes, oh, Rama, then Brahma, the lord of all worlds, indeed spoke this to the king Bhageeratha. [1-44-2]"
1-44-3,"Oh, tigerly-man Bhageeratha, the sixty thousands sons of great souled Sagara have crossed over the sea of mortality, and on a par with the gods they have also transited to heaven. [1-44-3]"
1-44-4,"As long as the water of the ocean abides in the world, oh, king, so long the sons of Sagara will abide in heaven like gods. [1-44-4]"
1-44-5,"This Ganga will become your eldest daughter and hereafter she will remain renowned in the world with the name associated with your deed of bringing her onto earth. [1-44-5]"
1-44-6,"Henceforth heavenly Ganga will be renowned as &#39;Triple-path-cruiser&#39; and &#39;Bhaageerathi,&#39; as well, and as this river is sanctifying three worlds, namely, <font color=""#B3003A"">svarga, bhuu, paataala loka</font>-s, &#39;heaven, earth and netherworld&#39; she will be remembered as the traveller on triple path. [1-44-6]"
1-44-7,"You may now offer water-oblations to all of your forefathers in the waters of Ganga, oh, king, the lord of people, thus you may fulfil and do away with the pledge of your requiescat. [1-44-7]"
1-44-8,"    Your ancestor Sagara is a highly glorious one and a best one among righteous persons, oh, king, even then he has not achieved this aspiration of alighting Ganga in his lifetime, but you have achieved it. [1-44-8]"
1-44-9,"Like that, your grandfather Amshuman, who is unequalled in his resplendence in this world and who had been praying for the descent of Ganga, he also could not dispense with this vow on fulfilling it. [1-44-9]"
1-44-10,"Oh, impeccable Bhageeratha, even by the kingly-sage Dileepa whose resplendence is kindred to great sages, who is equal to me in his ascesis, who is abided by the observances of ruling Kshatriya class, even by such a highly fortunate and highly resplendent father of yours it was impossible to bring Ganga in his turn, even though he had been supplicating for the descent of Ganga throughout his lifetime. [1-44-10, 11]"
1-44-11,"But, you have accomplished that pledge, oh, the best one among men, and in the world you have achieved highest renown which is highly adorable by all. [1-44-12]"
1-44-12,"That &#39;Descent of Ganga&#39; is perfected by you, oh, enemy-represser, and by this you have acquired a genuine basis for righteousness in this world, and thereby a base for yourself in my world, namely Abode of Brahma. [1-44-13]"
1-44-13,"Oh, phenomenal one, you may always take dip-baths in the holy water of Ganga and oh, persona grata, thereby get purified of sins and thus let your merit be fructified. [1-44-14]"
1-44-14,"&#39;You may now perform water-oblations to your forefathers with the water of Ganga, let there be wellbeing to you, and oh, king, here I go to my abode and you too may depart to yours.&#39; Thus Brahma said to Bhageeratha. [1-44-15]"
1-44-15,"On saying in this way, the forefather of all the worlds, and the great glorious lord of all gods, namely Brahma, went away to his empyrean world as he has came. [1-44-16]"
1-44-16,"On according those best water-oblations that endow superior realms to the souls of sons of Sagara, according to precedency and the rationale of scriptures, and even on offering water-oblations to other manes that kingly-sage and greatly renowned Bhageeratha is sanctified, and then only that king re-entered his own city, indeed when his purpose is completely achieved, and oh, outstanding man Rama, thus that king Bhageeratha ruled his kingdom well. [1-44-17, 18]"
1-44-17,"On regaining him as their king the subjects of the kingdom are overjoyed, and oh, Raghava, that king Bhageeratha too is relieved of his febrility as his purpose is achieved and he is happy when devoid of haunting grief of getting Ganga to earth. [1-44-19]"
1-44-18,"Oh, Rama, this way I described to you about &#39;The Decent of Ganga&#39; in detail, thus you be blest and prosperous, and as the visceral time is elapsing no more questions from you for now, and let us meditate on Gayatri. But listen to the fruits of listening the legend of <em>ganga avataraNa,</em> &#39;The Descent of Ganga&#39; [1-44-20]"
1-44-19,"This legend is conducive to achieve prosperity, fame, longevity, progeny and even heaven, and he who narrates this legend to others, whether he is from Brahmans or from Kshatriya-s, or for that matter of fact from any other class, his manes will be satisfied, and gods too will be gladdened. [1-44-21, 22a]"
1-44-20,"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha-s, he who listens to this auspicious legend named &#39;The Descent of Gang,&#39; which is an endower of longevity, all his wishes are achieved, all his sins are obliterated, and his reputation and longevity are also enhanced. Thus Vishvamitra concluded the episode of &#39;The Descent of Ganga.&#39; [1-44-22b, 23]"
1-45-1,"On listening the narration of Sage Vishwamitra about Ganga&#39;s descent along with Lakshmana, Rama went into a great astonishment, and then addressed Vishvamitra. [1-45-1]"
1-45-2,"The blessed legend you have narrated about the digging of an ocean at the behest of Sagara, Ganga&#39;s alighting, and Bhageeratha filling it with the water of Ganga is sacrosanct and even highly amazing. [1-45-2]"
1-45-3,"Oh, enemy-inflamer, for two of us entire night rolled by as if it is a single moment while we were thinking about the episode you have narrated in its entirety. [1-45-3]"
1-45-4,"While thinking about the auspicious legend of Ganga along with Lakshmana, oh, friend of the universe, Vishvamitra, whole night rolled by. Thus Rama is addressing Vishvamitra. [1-45-4]"
1-45-5,"Thereafter on the next fresh dawn the enemy-oppressor Raghava spoke these words to sage Vishvamitra, whose affluence is nothing but asceticism, and who by now has performed his daily chores of rituals. [1-45-5]"
1-45-6,"We have listened the praiseworthy legend of River Ganga, and the deific night has also passed by while listening such a legend, we may now cross over the very same prominent and merited River Ganga, the tri-path-cruiser. [1-45-6]"
1-45-7,"This boat which is suitable for the embarkation of the sages whose deeds are pious, and which is comfortably blanketed with mats in its deck has come here, and indeed on knowing about the visit of your holiness to this place the sages have fetched it. Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-45-7]"
1-45-8,"Hearing the words of great-souled Raghava, Vishvamitra of Kusha dynasty, started to cross over the River Ganga along with the assemblage of sages, and with both the Raghava-s. [1-45-8]"
1-45-9,"Arriving at the northern bank of River Ganga they have honoured the group of sages who ferried them up to here and sent them off. Then sojourning on the riverbank of Ganga they have seen the city called Vishaala. [1-45-9]"
1-45-10,"The great sage Vishvamitra then quickly started along with Rama and Lakshmana to the charming and admirable city Vishaala, which in comparison is like heaven. [1-45-10]"
1-45-11,"Then Rama, whose flair for knowing everything is high, became suppliant duly adjoining his palms, and enquired about the prominent city Vishala with the great Sage Vishvamitra. [1-45-11]"
1-45-12,"Oh, great sage, which dynasty of kings is ruling from this city of Vishaala? Let safeness betide you, I am interested to hear of it and indeed I am highly inquisitive about it. Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1- 45-12]"
1-45-13,"Hearing that sentence of Rama then the eminent sage Vishvamitra has commenced to narrate the legend of ancient Vishaala. [1-45-13]"
1-45-14,"Oh, Rama, I will tell you about the auspicious legend of Indra as I was told, and you listen to it as I tell. Oh, Raghava, indeed you may now listen to the quintessence of what has happened in this country. [1-45-14]"
1-45-15,"Once in Krita era, oh, Rama, the sons of Lady Diti were extremely energetic, whereas the sons of her younger sister Lady Aditi were vigorous and highly righteous. [1-45-15]"
1-45-16,"Oh, tigerly-man, Rama, then those great-souls speculated as to &#39;how we can thrive without ageing, illness, and likewise without death.&#39; [1-45-16]"
1-45-17,"A thought occurred to those masterminds who were thinking on that matter clueing them up, &#39;we indeed can get elixir of life by churning the Milky Ocean.&#39; [1-45-17]"
1-45-18,"Deciding upon to churn the Milky Ocean then made Vasuki, Thousand-headed King of Snakes, as the churning rope and Mt. Mandara as stirrer, and those brothers whose energy is unlimited have started churning the Milky Ocean thoroughly. [1-45-18]"
1-45-19,"After a thousand years, the Thousand-headed serpent Vaasuki, which is being used as churning rope, is incapacitated to bear the friction of churning and fanged the cliffs of Mt. Mandara. Thereby a great lot of venom is disgorged from the heads of that serpent Vaasuki, which venom on melting the rocks of Mt. Mandara became the holocaustic poison called <em>haalaahala</em>. [1-45-19]"
1-45-20,"A lethal poison similar to inferno known as <em>haalaahala</em> has started to fulminate therefrom, by which whole universe of gods, non-gods and humans is burnt down. [1-45-20]"
1-45-21,"The gods seeking shelter then approached Rudra, the Cardinal God, Endower of Solace, and who husbands all the created animals inclusive of human-animals, namely Shiva, and they prayed to him saying &#39;save, save us.&#39; [1-45-21]"
1-45-22,"This way while the gods are praying the Lord and God of Gods, namely Shiva, then handling his disc and conch-shell Vishnu has also revealed himself at that place. [1-45-22]"
1-45-23,"And Vishnu smilingly spoke to wielder of trident Rudra, &#39;oh, god the best, whatever element that has emerged from the churning of Milk Ocean by gods, that shall belong to you, isn&#39;t it. By virtue of your position as the foremost god among gods, oh, omnicompetent god Shiva, you please accept this poison applying yourself to that position of foremost god, and deeming this poison, haalahala, as a foremost oblation to your godhood&#39;. [1-45-23, 24]"
1-45-24,"Saying so Vishnu, the best one among gods, has disappeared then and there only. And on observing the scare of gods and also on paying heed to the words of the Wielder of Bow called <em>shaar"
1-45-25,"The god of gods Hara then left for his abode Kailash parting with other gods, and oh, Rama, the joy of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, the gods and non-gods have continued to churn the Milky Ocean. [1-45-26b, 27a]"
1-45-26,"Now the loftiest mountain that is being used as stirrer, namely Mt. Mandara, has caved into the netherworld, thereby the gods along with gandharva-s have prayed to Madhusuudana, the other name of Vishnu. [1-45-27b, 28a]"
1-45-27," &#39;You alone are the recourse to all beings, especially to the dwellers in heavens, oh ambidextrous god Vishnu, you safeguard us, it will be apt of you elevate the mountain.&#39; So prayed gods to Vishnu. [1-45-28b, 29a]"
1-45-28,"Hearing the prayer of gods Vishnu, Hrisheekesha, the controller of senses, adopting the form of a tortoise and positioning the stirring Mt. Mandara on that tortoiseshell, he lay recumbent at the bottom of Milky Ocean as a base to the stirrer. [1-45-29b, 30a]"
1-45-29,"Keshava then reached out his hand and grasped the mountaintop as he is the Cosmic-Soul, and thus staying amid gods that Supreme Person Vishnu participated in churning the ocean by holding the stirring mountain upright. [1-45-30b, 31a]"
1-45-30,"After a thousand years of churning, then a male personality, an epitome of Life Sciences, namely <strong>aayurveda</strong> , a highly righteous soul, named Dhanvantari, has firstly surfaced with his arm-rest-stick and with his handy water-vessel, and then the remarkably elegant Apsara-s, angelic damsels, have emerged next to him from the Milky Ocean. [1-45-31b, 32]"
1-45-31,"Choicest females have come out an elixir obtained on absolute churning of the waters of Milk Ocean, oh, best one among men, Rama, thereby that genera of females became Apsara-s. [1-45-33]"
1-45-32,"Six hundred millions of such Apsara-s with amazing dazzle have emerged from the churning of Milky Ocean, oh, descendent of Kakutstha, and their maidservants who emerged along with them are innumerable. [1-45-34]"
1-45-33,"Anybody either from gods or demons espoused them, and when none espoused them they are virtually reckoned as &#39;general-purpose&#39; Apsara-females. [1-45-35]"
1-45-34,"Oh, descendent of Raghu, then the heaven-sent damsel Vaaruni came up from Milky Ocean searching for her espousal, who is the daughter of Varuna, the Rain-god, and who incidentally is the presiding deity of hard liquors and also called as <em>sura</em>. [1-45-36]"
1-45-35,"Oh, Rama, the sons of Diti, namely asuraa-s, have not espoused that daughter of Rain-god, but oh, brave Rama, the sons of Aditi on their part, namely sura-s, have espoused that impeccable Vaaruni. [1-45-37]"
1-45-36,"Thereby the sons of Diti are called <em>asuraa</em>-s, and the sons of Aditi are called <em>suraa</em>-s, and gods are delighted and rejoiced on espousing Vaaruni. [1-45-38]"
1-45-37,"Then a best horse called Ucchaishravaa has emerged, oh, Rama, the best among men, and then a gem of a jewel, called Kaustubha, and like that <em>amrita</em>, the Supreme ambrosial elixir of gods, have also emerged. [1-45-39]"
1-45-38,"Owing to the dispute regarding the possession of that ambrosia, oh, Rama, then there chanced a rampant ethnic havoc, and then the sons of Aditi have havocked the sons of Diti. [1-45-40]"
1-45-39,"All the asura-s and demons have come to one side against sura-s, and there occurred a very gruesome war which was perplexing to all the triad of universe viz., ethereal, real and surreal spheres. [1-45-41]"
1-45-40,"When everything is wading into annihilation then that omnicompetent Vishnu swiftly impounded Amrita, the Divine Elixir, by assuming his illusory power of Mohini. [1-45-42]"
1-45-41,"Whoever confronted that Eternal and Supreme Person, namely Vishnu, in that war, then Vishnu whose blaze is threefold as manifest in the sun, fire and lightning, has pulverised him. [1-45-43]"
1-45-42,"In this horrendous war between the progeny of Diti, namely demons, and the progeny of Aditi, namely gods, the sons of Aditi being gods, have altogether massacred the demonic sons of Diti. [1-45-44]"
1-45-43,"On eliminating the demonic sons of Diti and on acquiring kingdom of heaven, that eliminator of enemy cities, namely Indra, happily ruled the worlds that are inclusive of sages and caarana-s. Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about Vishaala city and its emergence. [1-45-45]"
1-46-1,"Oh, Rama, Lady Diti was highly anguished for those sons that are killed and said this to her husband, Sage Kashyapa, the son of Sage Maareechi. Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. [1-46-1]"
1-46-2,"Oh, god, I am bereaved of my sons who are killed by your great mighty sons, the sons of your second wife Aditi, as such I wish to bear a son, who is achievable by sustained penance, for he shall be the exterminator of Indra. [1-46-2]"
1-46-3,"&#39;Such a bereaved mother as I am, I wish to undertake asceticism for a son who shall become an exterminator of Indra, and who shall be the ruler of worlds. As such, it will be apt of you to permit me for asceticism, and further it will be apt of you to accord me pregnancy with such a son.&#39; Thus Diti spoke to her husband Kaashyapa. [1-46-3]"
1-46-4,"On hearing her request the great resplendent sage Kaashyapa, the son of Sage Mareechi, replied Diti, who is deeply mournful. [1-46-4]"
1-46-5," &#39;So be it... oh, ascetically wealthy lady, you be blest, if you abide by the propriety of the practises of asceticism, then you will be delivering a son who can become an exterminator of Indra in war. [1-46-5]"
1-46-6,"&#39;If you can complete a thousand years of asceticism punctiliously, by my grace you can deliver a son who can be a husbander of three worlds.&#39; Thus Sage Kaashyapa advised his wife Diti. [1-46-6]"
1-46-7,"Saying thus that great resplendent sage patted her, and then on his touching her she is consecrated, and then that sage Kaashyapa departed for his ascetic practises, saying &#39;be blest.&#39; [1-46-7]"
1-46-8,"On the exit of Sage Kaashyapa, oh, best one among men Rama, highly elated Diti reached the sacred place called Kushaplava, on which the present City of Vishala is now standing, and practised a highly rigorous asceticism. [1-46-8]"
1-46-9,"While she is truly practising asceticism, oh, the best among men Rama, that Thousand-eyed god Indra has indeed rendered services with his abundant and surpassing veracities to her, who is none other than his maternal-aunt. [1-46-9]"
1-46-10,"The Thousand-eyed god Indra made available fire, firewood, water, the sacred Kusha grass, fruits and like that tubers also, and whatever other items she required in her ascetic practise. [1-46-10]"
1-46-11,"All the time Indra indeed served Diti by massaging her body, and other means of removing her bodily strain resulting from her arduous practises. [1-46-11]"
1-46-12,"Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, when ten years are less to complete the thousand years span of her ascetics, Diti is highly rejoiced as her ambition is going to fructify in just ten more years, and then she spoke to the Thousand-eyed god, Indra. [1-46-12]"
1-46-13,"Oh, best one among the valiant ones, Indra, to me who am practising asceticism ten years are remaining to complete, then you can see your brother, you be safe. [1-46-13]"
1-46-14,"Oh, son Indra, whom I am bringing up for your reason, I will bring him up as a victory-enthusiast, and oh, son, Indra, along with him conquering the three worlds you can enjoy them, without febrility from your enemies."
1-46-15,"Oh, son Indra, whom I am now bringing up, will be enthusiastic in conquering you, but somehow I will manage him by telling that you are after all his brother, and no harm shall be done to you, and oh, son Indra, if you join him you will get rid of your febrility, caused by his emergence, and then you two can conquer all the three worlds. [1-46-14]"
1-46-16,"Oh, best one among gods, Indra, on my prayer your high-souled father Sage Kaashyapa bestowed this boon on me for a son, which materialises at the end of thousand years, and only ten more years are to slip by. [1-46-15]"
1-46-17,"When Diti was saying thus, the noontime sun was reigning high that lady is stolen over by sleep keeping her feet headward. [1-46-16]"
1-46-18,"On observing her who has become impious by placing her head at feet-side and braid falling on feet, Indra is gladdened and laughed at her failed asceticism. [1-46-17]"
1-46-19,"Oh, Rama, being a highly courageous one, Indra the destroyer of enemy fastnesses, entered the body of Diti through her vaginal aperture and rent her foetus asunder into seven fragments. [1-46-18]"
1-46-20,"Oh, Rama, then that foetus wailed clamorously while being sliced with Thunderbolt that has hundred cutting edges, and then Diti woke up. [1-46-19]"
1-46-21,"&#39;Do not scream, do not scream...&#39; thus Indra was coaxing the foetus, and even though that foetus is screaming piteously the great resplendent Indra has gone on fragmenting it. [1-46-20]"
1-46-22,"&#39;Unkillable, unkillable is my foetus...&#39; thus Diti raved in that way, and then Indra fell out of the womb honouring his stepmother&#39;s entreaty. [1-46-21]"
1-46-23,"Indra humbly folding his palms that are still handling his bloody Thunderbolt spoke to Diti, &#39;oh, lady, you have become impious when your braid touched your feet and when you have gone to sleep in midday, and you vow is thwarted.&#39; [1-46-22]"
1-46-24,"Thereby I gained a chance to eliminate him who can eliminate Indra in a battle. Hence I fragmented your foetus into seven fragments, and it will be apt of you to pardon me for that act of mine. So said Indra to lady Diti. Thus, Sage Vishvamitra continued narration about City of Vishaala. [1-46-23]"
1-47-1,"Diti was highly anguished when her foetus is rendered into sevenfold, and spoke these appeasing words to the indomitable Thousand-eyed Indra. Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration about City Vishala. [1-47-1]"
1-47-2," &#39;Oh, Indra, the eliminator of demon Bala, this foetus of mine is sliced into seven segments owing to my own misdeed, oh, ruler of gods, Indra, indeed there is no iniquity of yours in this matter.&#39; Thus Diti started speaking to Indra. [1-47-2]"
1-47-3,"Though a reversal has happened against my thinking in the matter of my pregnancy, let these seven segments become your seven Wind-gods, the rulers of seven ethereal-places, under your ruler-ship. [1-47-3]"
1-47-4,"Oh, son Indra, let these seven sons of mine become the seven presiding deities of Cosmic Air Divisions and let them move in heaven with heavenly forms. [1-47-4]"
1-47-5,"One from the seven may permeate Brahma&#39;s abode, likewise another may permeate the heaven of Indra, and even the third one, let him become a greatly celebrated and reputed as Divine Wind, and he may circulate in entire universe. [1-47-5]"
1-47-6,"&#39;Oh, chief of gods, Indra, let four of my sons permeate four directions according to time and at your command, let safety betide you, and let them be renowned verily by the name given by you as &#39;Marut,&#39; because you have coaxed the crying fragments of foetus saying, &#39;maa ruda, maa ruda, &#39;do not cry, do not cry...&#39; Thus Diti said to Indra. [1-47-6, 7a]"
1-47-7,"On hearing her words, the Thousand-eyed destroyer of enemy&#39;s citadels and a demon named Bala, namely Indra, spoke this word to Diti, humbly adjoining his palms. [1-47-7b, 8a]"
1-47-8," &#39;All this will happen as you have said, undoubtedly, and your offspring, the Maaruta-s, would be pervading in the forms of gods, you be safe.&#39; Thus Indra assured Diti. Those two, the stepmother Diti and the stepson Indra, on arriving at a decision in that ascetic forest, departed to heaven fulfilling their purposes. Thus we heard the legend. Thus Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-47-8b, 9, 10a]"
1-47-9,"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, this province is that one which was once presided over by Indra, and where he rendered services to that accomplished one in her asceticism, namely lady Diti. [1-47-10b, 11a]"
1-47-10,"To king Ikshvaku of Vishaala, oh, tigerly-man Rama, a highly righteous son was born through queen Alambusa, and he was renowned as Vishaala. There is a city in this place constructed by him and known by his own name, Vishaala. [1-47-11b, 12]"
1-47-11,"Oh, Rama, Vishaala&#39;s son is the great-mighty Hemachandra, and Hemachandra&#39;s son is highly renowned as Suchandra.. [1-47-13]"
1-47-12,"The son of Suchandra became famous as Dhuumraashva, and oh, Rama, Dhuumraashva derived his son named Srinjaya. [1-47-14]"
1-47-13,"The fortunate and valorous son of Srinjaya is Sahadeva, and the son of Sahadeva is the most righteous Kushaashva. [1-47-15]"
1-47-14,"The highly resplendent and dauntless Somadatta is the son of Kushaashva and Somadatta&#39;s son is highly reputed as Kakutstha. [1-47-16]"
1-47-15,"Presently that Kakutstha&#39;s son named Sumati, who is a great-resplendent one, an unconquerable one, and a highly celebrated one is dwelling in this city. [1-47-17]"
1-47-16,"By the grace of Ikshvaku, the successive kings of Vishaala have longevity, intrepidity, well-off in generosity, and they were great-souled ones. [1-47-18]"
1-47-17,"Today we may gladly go to sleep here for a night, and oh, best one among men, and it will be apt of you to see Janaka, the King of Mithila tomorrow morning. Thus Sage Vishvamitra spoke to Rama and Lakshmana. [1-47-19]"
1-47-18,"The best one among best men, a widely reputed and the highly resplendent king of Vishaala, namely Sumati, having heard that Vishvamitra has arrived at the precincts of the city, came to him for a warm welcome. [1-47-20]"
1-47-19,"King Sumati arrived along with his mentors and family members, offered an excellent veneration to Vishvamitra, and then spoke to the sage with adjoined palms enquiring about his well being. [1-47-21]"
1-47-20,"To which province you have visited that happens to be mine, thereby I could get an audience of yours without stirring myself from my country, hence none will be more fortunate than me. So said king Sumati to Vishvamitra. [1-47-22]"
1-48-1,"When those two, Vishvamitra and Sumati, have met one another there at that place, king Sumati raised the topic of Rama and Lakshmana, after exchanging greetings and enquiring about the well-being of the great-saint Vishvamitra. [1-48-1]"
1-48-2,"  These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious elephants and arrogant lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, and bows, are valorous with their valour matching that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals and with youthfulness in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals have chanced on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have come here, and whose scions are they? [1-48-2, 3, 4]"
1-48-3,"These two best ones among men are identical to one another by their bodily proportion, facial-language, and by bodily gestures, and with their presence they refurbish this province like the Moon and Sun brightening the firmament. In truth, I would like to know for what reason these valiant ones who are wielding best weapons have arrived here travelling on an arduous path. Thus, king Sumati asked Vishvamitra. [1-48-5, 6]"
1-48-4,"On hearing those words of King Sumati, Vishvamitra informed him about the visit of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, also about the elimination of demons, as it has happened. [1-48-7a, 7b]"
1-48-5,"King Sumati is highly astonished to hear the words of Vishvamitra about the visit of Rama and Lakshmana, and treating them to have come as the most prominent and honour-worthy guests that king started to honour those two great-mighty sons of Dasharatha customarily. [1-48-7c, 8]"
1-48-6,"On getting high honours from King Sumati, Raghava-s stayed there along with Vishvamitra and with the community of sages for one night, and then they all have moved on to Mithila. [1-48-9]"
1-48-7,"On seeing Janaka&#39;s auspicious city Mithila, all of the saints who are accompanying Vishvamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana, extolled it saying, Splendid! Splendid! and admired it highly. [1-48-10]"
1-48-8,"On seeing a hermitage in the fringes of Mithila, that appeared to be age-old, but now uninhabited, yet pleasing, Rama asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-48-11]"
1-48-9,"This is semblable to a hermitage but sages seem to have discarded it. Oh, venerable sage, whose is this hermitage previously, I wish to listen of it. Thus, Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-48-12]"
1-48-10,"On hearing that sentence spoken by Raghava, the expert in sententiousness, a great resplendent sage and eminent-saint Vishvamitra replied him in this way. [1-48-13]"
1-48-11,"What a pleasure! You may listen as I narrate, Raghava, whose hermitage is this factually, and which great soul has resentfully cursed this. [1-48-14]"
1-48-12,"Oh, the best one among men Rama, this hermitage with a heavenly glisten, and highly hallowed even by gods, once belonged to the great-souled sage Gautama. [1-48-15]"
1-48-13,"In this hermitage, oh, prince Rama, once that highly renowned Sage Gautama sat tight in asceticism for numerous cycle of years along with his wife Ahalya. [1-48-16]"
1-48-14,"On knowing the meantime of Gautama&#39;s availability at hermitage, Indra, the husband of Shaci Devi and the Thousand-eyed god wearing the guise of sage Gautama and becoming such a sage, approached Ahalya and said this to her. [1-48-17]"
1-48-15,"Oh, finely limbed lady, indulgers do not watch out for the time to conceive, as such oh, slender-waisted one, I desire copulation with you. [1-48-18]"
1-48-16,"Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, though knowing him as the Thousand-eyed Indra in the guise of her husband Gautama, she is inclined to have intercourse ill-advisedly, only to satisfy the impassion of the King of Gods. [1-48-19]"
1-48-17,"She felt fulfilled in her heart of hearts and then she said this to that best god Indra, &#39;I am gratified in complying with your wish, oh, best of gods, get going oh, lord, from here quickly, oh, ruler of gods, always safeguard yourself and me from Sage Gautama.&#39; Thus, Ahalya said to Indra. [1-48-20, 21a]"
1-48-18,"Indra on his part smilingly said this word to Ahalya, &#39;oh, well-hipped lady, I am quite delighted, here I go as I have came.&#39; [1-48-21b, 22a]"
1-48-19,"Oh, Rama, Indra then came out of the cottage flustering hurriedly after copulating with her with an uncertainty about the arrival of Sage Gautama. [1-48-22b, 23a]"
1-48-20,"Indra looked at Gautama..the one who is great saint, inaccessible to gods and demons, full of ascetic power,purified with holy water, bright like fire, holding Samidha-s and kusha grass in hands,and eminent Sage entering into the hermitage. [1-48-23b, 24, 25a]"
1-48-21,"On seeing the sage the lord of gods Indra is scared and became dreary-faced. Then the well-behaved Gautama furiously spoke these words on seeing the ill-behaved Thousand-eyed Indra who is donning the guise of a saint. [1-48-25b, 26]"
1-48-22,"&#39;Oh, dirty-minded Indra, taking hold of my form you have effectuated this unacceptable deed, whereby you shall become infecund.&#39; Thus, Gautama cursed Indra. [1-48-27]"
1-48-23,"When that great-souled sage Gautama spoke that way with rancour, the testicles of the cursed Thousand-eyed Indra fell down onto ground at that very moment. [1-48-28]"
1-48-24,"On cursing Indra thus the sage cursed even his wife saying, &#39;you shall tarry here for many thousands of years to come without food and consuming air alone, and unseen by all beings you shall live on in this hermitage while contritely recumbent in dust.&#39; [1-48-29, 30]"
1-48-25,"When that unassailable son of Dasharatha, namely Rama, arrives at this squalid forest, for it will be henceforth rendered so along with you, then you will be purified. [1-48-31]"
1-48-26,"&#39;On your welcoming Rama, oh, ill-behaved woman, you will be divested of your greed and craze in which you lingered so far, and then you will assume your own body and then you can be in my proximity, rejoicingly.&#39; Thus, Sage Gautama cursed his wife Ahalya. [1-48-32]"
1-48-27,"On cursing immodest Ahalya thus, that great-resplendent Sage Gautama shed this hermitage which was once adored by celestials like siddha-sand caarana-s, and that great-ascetic Gautama practised his asceticism on the pleasant peaks of Himalayas. Thus, Vishvamitra continued his narration about the legend of Ahalya. [1-48-33]"
1-49-1,"The emasculated Indra then with panicked eyes spoke to gods, siddha-s, gandharva-s, and carana-s, keeping Fire-god as their helms-god. [1-49-1]"
1-49-2,"I have Indeed incited fury in that noble-souled Sage Gautama by effectuating hindrance in his asceticism, but I have accomplished a task of gods. [1-49-2]"
1-49-3,"By Gautama&#39;s anger I am rendered testicle-less and his wife Ahalya is also rejected by the sage, and thus by his releasing a severe curse his propriety for ascesis is dwindled, therefore his ascesis is pre-empted by me. [1-49-3]"
1-49-4,"&#39;Therefore, oh, all gods with the assemblages of sages and caarana-s, it will be apt of you to make me virile again, as I have acted for the benefit of gods.&#39; Thus Indra spoke to all gods. [1-49-4]"
1-49-5,"On hearing the words of the officiator for Hundred-Vedic-rituals, namely Indra, all of the gods and other assemblages of celestials, together with the groups of Marut-gods came to the godly manes keeping the Fire-god in van, and appealed. [1-49-5]"
1-49-6,"&#39;This ram is with testicles and Indra is indeed rendered testicle-less. Taking the testicles of this ram they may be given to Indra quickly.&#39; Thus Fire-god started his appeal to manes. [1-49-6]"
1-49-7,"&#39;This ram that is being offered to you shall now be gelded to give its testes to Indra, and though this ram is deprived of its organ it will be complete and it endows complete satisfaction to you. To those humans who hereafter offer testes-less rams in sacrifices for the purpose of your gratification, you shall truly offer them plentiful and unmitigated benefits.&#39; Thus Agni, the Fire-god spoke to manes. [1-49-7]"
1-49-8,"On hearing the words of Agni, the Fire-god, the manes-gods who gathered to collect their share of offering have extricated that ram&#39;s testes, which is not yet sacrificed but tethered to a sacrificial post, and offered them to the Thousand-eyed Indra. [1-49-8]"
1-49-9,"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, from then onwards the manes-gods who come to collect their share are enjoying even the goats, even if they do not have testes, to endow benefits thereof to those that offer those goats, and to join the testes of goats to Indra. [1-49-9]"
1-49-10,"Oh, Raghava, owing to the efficacy of the great-souled Gautama and his ascesis, from then onwards Indra has became one with the testes of a goat. [1-49-10]"
1-49-11,"Therefore, oh, great-resplendent Rama, enter the hermitage of Gautama whose deeds are pietistic, and atone Ahalya who is highly fortunate and who is in the compose of a divinity. Thus Vishvamitra spoke to Rama. [1-49-11]"
1-49-12,"On hearing Vishvamitra&#39;s words Rama entered the hermitage along with Lakshmana and keeping Vishvamitra afore. [1-49-12]"
1-49-13,"She whose splendour is brightened by her ascesis, at whom it is impossible to raise an eye for a stare either for gods, or for demons, or for the worldly beings on coming close to her, whom the Creator has contrived with careful contemplation as an angelic and a completely phantasmal entity, who is like the befogged and beclouded moonshine of a full moon as she is hitherto enshrouded by the dried up leaves and dust, who is like an unwatchable sunshine mirrored in and glowing from the midst of water, for she is hitherto in the midst of denounce, and whose limbs are like the tongues of a flaring fire around which fumes are cloaking, as she is hitherto practising an utmost ascesis subsisting on air alone, which ascesis alone made her like a flaring Ritual Fir, and Rama has seen such a highly glorious Ahalya. [1-49-13, 14, 15]"
1-49-14,"Ahalya is indeed indiscernible to all the three worlds by the very word of Gautama until the manifestation of Rama. [1-49-16a, b]"
1-49-15,"On reaching the end of curse she came into the view of Raghava-s, and they too gladly touched her feet in reverence. [1-49-16c, 17a]"
1-49-16,"Reminiscing Gautama&#39;s words Ahalya received those two, and self-consciously offered water for feet and hand washing, and like that she also offered guestship customarily and dutifully, and Rama of Kakutstha on his part acquiesced her hospitality. [1-49-18]"
1-49-17,"There chanced an abundant floral fall form firmament to the drumbeats of god&#39;s drums, and the celestials like gandharva-s, apsara-s revelled in a splendid festivity that is superb. [1-49-19]"
1-49-18,"Gods have collectively reverenced her, whose limbs are depurated by the asset of her ascesis which is performed as a devotee of Gautama remaining in his directives, saying &#39;Gracious! Goodness!&#39; [1-49-20]"
1-49-19,"Even that great-resplendent Gautama is heartened when he reunited with Ahalya after a long, long a time, and that sage customarily reverenced Rama for actualising his solemn utterance, and that great-ascetic Gautama continued his ascesis together with Ahalya. [1-49-21]"
1-49-20,"Even Rama on receiving a conventionally high veneration in the manifestness of that great-saint Gautama himself, then moved ahead to Mithila. [1-49-22]"
1-50-1,"Rama then travelled along with Lakshmana towards northeast direction keeping Vishvamitra afore and neared the hall of Vedic ritual of Janaka in Mithila kingdom. [1-50-1]"
1-50-2,"Rama who is with Lakshmana spoke to the tigerly saint Vishvamitra,  the Vedic-ritual of noble-souled Janaka is excellent, indeed with bountifully garnered paraphernalia of the ritual. [1-50-2]"
1-50-3,"Oh, highly fortunate sage, this place abounds with many thousands of Brahmans who are experts in Vedic practises and who seem to be the dwellers of numerous provinces, and also discernable are the cottages of sages rife with hundreds of carts full with their ceremonial chattels, as such oh, Brahman, a campsite may be decided for us too, as I discern every inch is inhabited. Thus Rama spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-50-3, 4]"
1-50-4,"On hearing the words of Rama that great-saint Vishvamitra arranged a camp at an unfrequented place that has refreshing water. [1-50-5]"
1-50-5,"On hearing that Vishvamitra has arrived in Mithila, then the best king Janaka instantly forged ahead towards Vishvamitra, keeping his unreprovable priest Shataananda afore of the team, in deference to Vishvamitra. [1-50-6, 7a]"
1-50-6,"Even the Ritvik-s, the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, of the great souled king Janaka arrived with post-haste taking holy waters, and they have ritualistically offered that sanctified water to Vishvamitra. [1-50-7b, 8a]"
1-50-7,"On receiving that veneration from the great souled Janaka, Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of the king Janaka, as well about the unhindered proceedings of that Vedic-ritual. [1-50-8b, 9a]"
1-50-8,"Then Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of saints, mentors, clerics, as befitting to their order, and joined the company of all of the sages as a happy-souled sage. [1-50-9b, 10a]"
1-50-9,"The king Janaka adjoining his palms then spoke to that eminent-sage Vishvamitra, oh, reverend sage, please be seated on this high seat, along with these eminent saints in their respective seats. Thus Janaka spoke to Vishvamitra [1-50-10b, 11a]"
1-50-10,"On hearing the words of Janaka that great-sage Vishvamitra took his seat, and king Janaka also took seat along with his royal priest Shataananda, and the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, namely Ritvik-s, and along with his ministers. [1-50-11b, 12a]"
1-50-11,"On beholding all of them seated all about in their respective seats as demanded by procedure king Janaka then spoke to Vishvamitra. [1-50-12b, 13a]"
1-50-12,"Today my Vedic ritual is enriched with your advent, whereby I deem that gods have fructified the ritual. Let the ritual be like that. I deem that I have obtained the fruit of the ritual just on seeing godlike you here today. [1-50-13b, 14a]"
1-50-13,"Oh, Brahman, at which Vedic-ritual hall you have arrived along with so many sages that happens to be mine, whereby, oh, eminent saint, I feel that I am honoured and hallowed. [1-50-14b, 15a]"
1-50-14,"Oh, Brahma-sage, the scholarly Ritvik-s conducting my Vedic-ritual are saying that only twelve more days are remaining to complete the observation of ritual-pledge, and then oh, Kaushika, it will be apt of you to see the gods who arrive at the conclusion of this Vedic-ritual expecting their due in the ritual. So said king Janaka to Vishvamitra. [1-50-15b, 16a]"
1-50-15,"On speaking to that tigerly sage Vishvamitra in this way, the king again asked the sage pointedly and inquisitively with adjoined palms and with a gladdened face. [1-50-16b, 17a]"
1-50-16,"These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious elephants and arrogant lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine bulls, and wielding quivers, swords, and bows, are valorous with their valour matching that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals and with youthfulness in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals have chanced on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have come here, and whose scions are they? [1-50-17b, 18, 19]"
1-50-17,"Oh, great-saint, whose sons are these two valiant youngsters who are brandishing best weapons? They are embellishing this province as the Sun and Moon doeth the sky. Each to each they are clonal by postural-language, by facial-language and by body language. They appear valorous but boyish in their appearance, as their curls are still jet-black like crow-wings. Thus, whether they are immature by age though mature by their valour or so, I wish to listen about them in actuality. [1-50-20, 21]"
1-50-18,"On hearing the words of great-souled Janaka, Vishvamitra whose anima is immeasurable, has announced that those two as the sons of king Dasharatha. [1-50-22]"
1-50-19,"The highly resplendent great-saint Vishvamitra has informed the high souled Janaka about the coming of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of Accomplishment, their stopping over there and elimination of demons at that place, their indefatigable travel along with him, beholding City of Vishaala, seeing Ahalya, her reuniting with Sage Gautama, likewise their coming hitherward to gain a grasp of great bow of Shiva. On informing all these incidents to Janaka as well as to Shataananda, who incidentally is the son of Ahalya, sage Vishvamitra paused. [1-50-23, 24, 25]"
1-51-1,"On hearing that sentence of that intellectual sage Vishvamitra, the highly refulgent and the great ascetic Shataananda is overjoyed, and Sage Shataananda, the eldest son of Sage Gautama, and whose radiance is brightened by his own ascesis is highly amazed just on seeing Rama. [1-51-1, 2]"
1-51-2,"On raptly observing those two princes who are sitting comfortably with their heads bending down submissively, then Shataananda spoke to the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-51-3]"
1-51-3,"Oh, tigerly saint Vishvamitra, you have revealed my glorious mother Ahalya who meted out a marathon ascesis to the princes - Really! [1-51-4]"
1-51-4,"And the highly resplendent and celebrated mother of mine worshipped Rama, who is worthy of worship by every corporeal being, with forest produce, is it so! [1-51-5]"
1-51-5,"Oh, great-resplendent Vishvamitra, you have narrated to Rama about the maltreatment of my mother by the Providence as has happened anciently, isn&#39;t it![1-51-6]"
1-51-6,"Oh, the best sage Kaushika, you be safe, my mother is reunited with my father on beholding and giving hospitality to Rama - Really! [1-51-7]"
1-51-7,"Oh, Kaushika, my father came to my mother&#39;s place from Himalayas! Has the great resplendent father of mine worshipped Rama because the redemption of my mother is per the kindness of Rama! Has this great-souled Rama reverenced that great resplendent father of mine by according a redemption, <font color=""#B3003A"">ahalyaa-daana</font>, the endowment of Ahalya to her husband. [1-51-8]"
1-51-8,"Oh, Kaushika, on his arrival at my mother&#39;s place whether this reverential Rama reverenced my father with a pacified heart without becoming contumelious! Thus sage Shataananda exclaimed at the marvel occurred through Rama. [1-51-9]"
1-51-9,"On hearing that sentence of his, that great-saint and sentence-precisian Sage Vishvamitra, replied the sentence-precisionist Sage Shataananda. [1-51-10]"
1-51-10,"I have done whatever good is to be done and nothing is left undone, and the wife of the sage, namely Ahalya, is reunited with her husband sage Gautama, as with Renuka who was reunited with sage Jamadagni, the descendent of Bhrigu. So said Vishvamitra. [1-51-11]"
1-51-11,"On hearing those words of that highly intellectual Vishvamitra, high refulgent sage Shataananda spoke these words to Rama. [1-51-12]"
1-51-12,"Hail to thee! Oh, best one among men Rama, your arrival is a godsend, not only to Mithila but to entire humanity, and oh, Raghava, as an undefeatable great-sage Vishvamitra spearheads you, so shall your mission be undefeatable, thus hail to thee! [1-51-13]"
1-51-13,"This highly resplendent Vishvamitra&#39;s exploits are unimaginable. He attained the highest order of Brahma-sage by his ascesis, thus illimitable is his ascetic resplendence, and you have to know him as an ultimate course, not only to you alone, but also to one and all. [1-51-14]"
1-51-14,"None other than you is fortunate enough on earth, oh, Rama, as you are in the custodial care of Vishvamitra, the scion of Kushika, who has practised supreme ascesis. [1-51-15]"
1-51-15,"What is the prowess of the great-souled Vishvamitra, and what the quintessence of his legend may be heard from me while I narrate it. [1-51-16]"
1-51-16,"This probity-souled Vishvamitra, being a proficient in rectitude, a perfectionist in kingcraft, a proponent of people&#39;s welfare, more so a persecutor of enemies, was there as a king for a long time. [1-51-17]"
1-51-17,"There was a king named Kusha, a brainchild of Prjaapati, and Kusha&#39;s son was the powerful and verily righteous Kushanaabha. [1-51-18]"
1-51-18,"One who is highly renowned by the name Gaadhi was the son of Kushanaabha, and Gaadhi&#39;s son is this great-saint of great resplendence, Vishvamitra. [1-51-19]"
1-51-19,"Vishvamitra ruled the earth, and this great-resplendent king ruled the kingdom for many thousands of years. [1-51-20]"
1-51-20,"At one time the great-resplendent king Vishvamitra went round the earth marshalling a unit of <font color=""#B3003A"">akshauhini</font> army. [1-51-21]"
1-51-21,"Moving sequentially about the provinces, cities, rivers likewise mountains, king Vishvamitra arrived at the threshold of a hermitage which is with numerous flowered trees and climbers, overspread with very many herds of animals, adored by the celestials like siddha-s and caarana-s, frequented and embellished with gods, demons, gandharva-s, and kinnara-s, spread out with equable deer, adored by flights of birds, compacted with the assemblages of Brahma-sages, and also with the assemblages of godly-sages who are fully accomplished in their ascesis, where the personal resplendence of each of the great-souled sage is similar to each of the Ritual-fire available in each of the Ritual Fire Altar before which he is sitting, and which hermitage is bustling with the activity of great-souled sages who are comparable to Brahma, among whom some subsist on water alone, and some on air alone, likewise some more on dry leaves, while some on fruits, tubers, and with such of those sages and also with particular sages like Vaalakhilyaa-s, also with others like Vaikhaanasa-s, who are all self-controlled, who have overcame their peccabilites, who have overpowered their senses that hermitage is occupied, and while everyone of the inmates is engaged in meditations and oblations into Ritual-fire, and with such sages and their activity whole of the perimeter of that hermitage is brightened and rendered splendent, and king Vishvamitra arrived at such a magnificent hermitage of Sage Vashishta. [1-51-22, 23, 24, 2125, 26, 27, 28a]"
1-51-22,"And this best one among vanquishers and the great-stalwart Vishvamitra has then seen the hermitage of Vashishta which is like the worldly Universe of Brahma. Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-51-28]"
1-52-1,"On seeing at that best sage among best meditators Sage Vashishta, the great-mighty and valorous Vishvamitra is highly rejoiced and obediently made an obeisance to the sage. [1-52-1]"
1-52-2,"The great-souled Vashishta spoke, you are welcome, and that godly sage has indeed shown a high seat to Vishvamitra. [1-52-2]"
1-52-3,"The eminent saint Vashishta then customarily offered fruits and tuber to the courageous Vishvamitra who by now has assumed a seat. [1-52-3]"
1-52-4,"On receiving that deference from Vashishta, then that unsurpassed king Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of the ascesis, Fire-rituals and disciples and their progress in that hermitage, and that great-resplendent Vishvamitra has also asked after the well being of flora and fauna of the hermitage, and Vashishta reported to the matchless king about the all round well-being of every activity. [1-52-4, 5]"
1-52-5,"Vashishta the supreme one among meditators, a great-ascetic, and the brainchild of Brahma has then asked Vishvamitra who is sitting at ease. [1-52-6]"
1-52-6,"I hope that you are fine! And oh, righteous king, hope that you are ruling people righteously with kingly righteousness to their contentment. [1-52-7]"
1-52-7,"I hope your servants are looked after well, hope all of them are abiding by the rulership, oh, vanquisher of adversaries, I hope that you have surely vanquished all of your adversaries. [1-52-8]"
1-52-8,"For you are an impeccable one and an emery-inflamer, oh, tigerly-man, I hope that your forces, exchequer and confederates are fine, and all is well with your sons and grandsons. Thus Vashishta asked the well-being of Vishvamitra. [1-52-9]"
1-52-9,"The great-resplendent king Vishvamitra respectfully replied Sage Vashishta saying, &#39;everything is fine.&#39; [1-52-10]"
1-52-10,"Both of those celebrities of conscientious then exchanged pleasantries for a long time with their rejoice heightening and gladdening one another. [1-52-11]"
1-52-11,"Then at the end of discussions, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, that godly Sage Vashishta smilingly spoke this sentence to Vishvamitra. [1-52-12]"
1-52-12,"I wish to offer guestship befitting to your status, oh, great-forceful king Vishvamitra, to a matchless one like you and to this military force of yours, kindly accept it from me. [1-52-13]"
1-52-13,"&#39;You may kindly accept all these hospitalities offered by me, oh king, for you are an important guest you ought to be reverenced effortfully.&#39; So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-52-14]"
1-52-14,"When sage Vashishta said in this way, that highly-intellectual king Vishvamitra said to him, &#39;hospitality is deemed to have been offered to me with your reverential words, it is enough and nothing more is necessary.&#39; [1-52-15]"
1-52-15,"I am entertained with whatever item that obtains in your hermitage, say fruits, tubers and water for feet-wash and to wet mouth. Why those petty items, I regaled just by seeing you, a godly sage like. Oh, highly noetic sage, by yourself you are a sage worthy to be reverenced by one and all, such as you are you alone have reverenced me. Now I wish to take leave, please accept my obeisance to you, and please look upon us with a friendlily regard. [1-52-16, 17]"
1-52-16,"Even if the king was speaking in this way obliquely to him, that virtue-souled and magnanimous sage Vashishta entreated the king repeatedly. [1-52-18]"
1-52-17,"Gaadhi&#39;s son Vishvamitra then replied the eminent saint Vashishta, Agreed! As it pleases the godly sage. So be it! [1-52-19]"
1-52-18,"When Vishvamitra said that way then Vashishta, the best one among meditators, and one whose blemishes are laved is gladdened, and started calling his speckled cow, namely Shabala, yclept Kaamadhenu. [1-52-20]"
1-52-19,"Come on, oh, Shabala! Come quickly and listen to my words. I prepared to accord hospitality with a highly delectable royal banquet to this kingly sage together with all his forces. You arrange it for me. [1-52-21]"
1-52-20,"Oh, Kaamadhenu, the Divine Cow, the Milker of All-Desires, for my sake you shower whatsoever foodstuff is savoured by whosoever according to one&#39;s own piquancy from each of the six savour, that too plentifully. [1-52-22]"
1-52-21," &#39;Oh, Shabala, you create heaps of savourily foodstuffs comprised of masticable items like crunchy foods, drinkable items like soft-drinks, tasteable items like honey-like viscous dishes, squeezable items like pulpy fruits, and be quick.&#39;  So said Sage Vashishta to that Sacred Cow, Kaamadhenu, and Vishvamitra continued his narration. [1-52-23]"
1-52-22,"Thus, this is the 52nd chapter in Bala Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India."
1-53-1,"Oh, enemy-chastener Rama, when the Divine Cow Shabala is spoken in this way by Sage Vashishta, then that milker bestowed each and every fancy, fancied by each and every fancier, according to one&#39;s own fancy. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shabala or Kaamadhenu, as a part of the legend of Vishvamitra to Rama and others. [1-53-1]"
1-53-2,"Shabala bestowed dishes of sugar cane and honey, and flakes of all sorts, like cornflakes, rice-flakes, also best arracks and liquors in best wineglasses, further, the drinks and foodstuffs that are very diverse and verily apposite to royalties and army-men. [1-53-2]"
1-53-3,"There emerged mountainous stacks of steamy foodstuffs, palatable side-dishes and desserts of rice etc., also the dumplings of cooked pulses, like that the cascades of curds and the other milk products like butter, ghee, cheese etc. Thousands of silver dishes and hollowware fully replete with daintily soft drinks, like that full with sugar-candy preparations, and with preparations that comprise all the six tastes have come up together with delectable foodstuffs made out of treacly dumplings of cane sugar. [1-53-3, 4]"
1-53-4,"Oh, Rama, all of the men in the forces of Vishvamitra, who are already rejoiced and regaled by the regular feasts accorded by their king Vishvamitra, are now comparatively well gladdened when feasted by Sage Vashishta, in which they rejoiced and regaled, for a good measure. [1-53-5]"
1-53-5,"Partaking that feast together with the best royal ladies of palace chambers, and with the court-scholars and the court-priests even the king Vishvamitra, who by his nature is a kingly sage, became exultant and energetic. [1-53-6]"
1-53-6,"When honoured along with his advisers, ministers and attendants by way of receiving a royal banquet, king Vishvamitra then in high admiration spoke this to Vashishta. [1-53-7]"
1-53-7,"You showed me a generous hospitality whereby I am esteemed by an estimable sage like you, oh, expert in sententiousness, now I wish to say for myself to which you may please listen. [1-53-8]"
1-53-8,"&#39;Oh, godly sage, this Shabala may be given to me for a barter of a lakh, a hundred thousand, cows. Indeed this do-all cow is a treasure, and the kings are the gatherers of treasures. Therefore bestow this cow to me. As rule this cow also belongs to me.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra said to Vashishta. [1-53-9, 10a]"
1-53-9,"When Vishvamitra addressed him in that way, the reverential sage Vashishta, who is a virtue-souled eminent saint, on his part replied the king in this way. [1-53-10b, 11a]"
1-53-10,"I cannot afford Shabala, neither by the barter of a hundred thousand cows, nor by hundreds of millions of cows, nor by lots and lots of silver, either. [1-53-11b, 12a]"
1-53-11,"Abandoning her from my proximity is unmeet for her, oh, enemy-subjugator, you cannot even subjugate me terroristically and try to wean this cow away from me, as Shabala is everlastingly and inseparably mine, as with the everlasting and inseparable respectability of a self-respectful person. [1-53-12b, 13a]"
1-53-12,"This cow makes the journey of my life possible. Oblations to gods or manes, enkindling of Ritual-fire, religious sacrifices, <font color=""#B3003A"">homa</font>-s, the sacred rituals conducted as<font color=""#B3003A"">darshapaurNamaasi</font>, all are dependent on her. [1-53-13b, 14a]"
1-53-13,"This cow is the bedrock for everything in its entirety, and regarding diverse and numerous indoctrinations, and even for add-on syllabics like <font color=""#B3003A"">svaahaa, vaSaT</font>, they are all dependent on this cow, there is no doubt about it. [1-53-14b 15a]"
1-53-14,"In truth, this cow is everything to me and ever-gratifier, that way by so many reasons, oh, king, I cannot afford Shabala to you or to anyone. So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-53-15b, 16a]"
1-53-15,"Though Vashishta spoke thus Vishvamitra being an expert in sententiousness then spoke this sentence compellingly and argumentatively. [1-53-16b, 17a]"
1-53-16,"I bestow upon you fourteen thousand elephants adorned with golden girdles, golden necklets and golden goads. [1-53-17b, 18a]"
1-53-17,"I will grant you eight hundred golden chariots whichever can be yoked on with four whitely-white horses trimmed up with the sets of tintinnabulating bells. [1-53-18b, 19a]"
1-53-18,"I grant you, oh, superbly vowed sage, eleven thousand fleetly galloping horses of high pedigree born in best countries of best horse breeding. [1-53-19b, c]"
1-53-19,"I award ten million diversely coloured and differently divisionalized cows, whichever of them will be came of age as milker, thereby, let this do-all cow Shabala be given to me. [1-53-20]"
1-53-20,"Or, oh, eminent Brahman, if you yearn either for gems or gold, I gift that much of everything as much as you can yearn, let Shabala be given to me. Thus Vishvamitra entreated again. [1-53-21]"
1-53-21,"When the shrewd king Vishvamitra spoke to the reverential sage Vashishta, that sage has clearly said, &#39;whatever it is oh, king, I do not surrender Shabala, the cow.&#39; [1-53-22]"
1-53-22,"Really this alone is my gemmy cow, thus I do not require your jewels or gems... truly, this alone is my treasure, thus I do not require your gilded chariots, horses or elephants... really, this alone is my everything, thus I need nothing from you... and actually, this alone is my alter-ego, thus you cannot separate me from myself. [1-53-23]"
1-53-23,"This alone is my <font color=""#B3003A"">darsha-puurNamaasa</font> rituals, and like that this alone is all my Vedic-rituals with worthwhile donations and oh, king, this essentially is of service in diverse activities of mine. [1-53-24]"
1-53-24," Oh, king, all of my activities are instated in this cow, then wherefore a lot of palavering a bargain or barter? I do not give away this milker any wish. So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra, and thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of the legend of Sacred Cow. [1-53-25]"
1-54-1,"When Sage Vashishta did not yield Kaamadhenu, the milker of any desire, oh, Rama, then Vishvamitra started to seize it. Sage Shataananda continued the narration of the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-54-1]"
1-54-2,"While the determined king Vishvamitra dragged her away from Vashishta, oh, Rama, Shabala is saddened and tearfully mulled over stung by the anguish of her secession from the sage. [1-54-2]"
1-54-3,"A pitiable and highly anguished one, such as I am. I am being dragged away by the servants of the king. Has this great souled Sage Vashishta abandoned me, or what? [1-54-3]"
1-54-4,"&#39;Or, did I do any misdeed towards that great sage of sacred soul whereby he is leaving me off. I have always been reverent and a cherished cow to that priest and am I no errant.&#39; That cow eulogised in this manner. [1-54-4]"
1-54-5,"On thinking thus and suspiring repeatedly, oh, enemy-subjugator, Rama, then she that Sacred Cow hastily rushed with the speed a gust and went to that highly energetic Vashishta on utterly shoving off hundreds of attendants of the king who are roping her, and then she straight went to the base of the feet of the great-souled Vashishta. [1-54-5, 6]"
1-54-6,"She that moaning and groaning Shabala staying before the Sage Vashishta spoke this bellowing like a thunderous cloud. [1-54-7]"
1-54-7,"&#39;Oh, Son of Brahma, why I am discarded by you, whereby oh, god, the king&#39;s attendants are weaning me away from your proximity.&#39; So Shabala urged Vashishta. [1-54-8]"
1-54-8,"When he is spoken thus, then that Brahma-sage spoke this sentence to worrisome Shabala, whose heart is worrying with worry, as he would speak with his own sister in her worriment. [1-54-9]"
1-54-9,"Neither I forswear you nor you fouled me, oh, Shabala, this king is forcibly weaning you away from me as he is beside himself with kingly arrogance. [1-54-10]"
1-54-10,"&#39;My ability is not balanceable with his, isn&#39;t it. Above all, on his part he is a king now, and a king will be mighty, he is the lord of the land and a Kshatriya, and thus we have to be subservient to a Kshatriya, isn&#39;t it. [1-54-11]"
1-54-11,"&#39;This <font color=""#B3003A"">akShauhiNi</font> unit of army is plethoric, overcrowded with elephants, horses, and chariots, and overspread with flags and elephants, thereby he is mightier than me.&#39; Thus Vashishta tried to pacify that Sacred-Cow. [1-54-12]"
1-54-12,"She who is spoken that way by Vashishta, that sententious Sacred Cow, Shabala, in her turn obediently spoke this sentence to that Brahma-sage of un-balanceable resplendence. [1-54-13]"
1-54-13,"&#39;Oh, Brahman, unstated is that the might of sovereignty as mightier than the might of sagacity. A sage is mightier than a sovereign. A sage&#39;s might is mightiest than the mightier sovereign, for a sage&#39;s might is angelic.&#39; So Shabala started talking to the sage. [1-54-14]"
1-54-14,"Immutable is your power as you are mightier than great-mighty Vishvamitra and invincible is your dynamism. [1-54-15]"
1-54-15,"&#39;Ordain me, oh, highly resplendent sage, who am replete with the power of your sagacity, and I will disprove the vanity, valour, and venture of that injudicious king for this injudicious seizure.&#39; Thus Shabala implored the sage Vashishta. [1-54-16]"
1-54-16,"Oh, Rama, when spoken by her thus, that highly glorious Vashishta said to Shabala, the do-all cow, &#39;create a power that can overpower the power of opponent.&#39; Vashishta said so to Shabala.[1-54-17]"
1-54-17,"On hearing his sentence, oh, Rama, that Sacred Cow Shabala then created Pahlava kings, sprang forth from her mooing &#39;hums&#39;, and hundreds of them annihilated the army of Vishvamitra in its entirety just while Vishvamitra is witnessing it. [1-54-18, 19a]"
1-54-18,"King Vishvamitra was utterly infuriated and with wide-eyed anger he started to destroy those Pahlava-s with many a kind of his weaponry. [1-54-19b, 20a]"
1-54-19,"On seeing the subdual of hundreds of Pahlava-s by Vishvamitra, then the Sacred Cow again generated deadly Shaka-s hobnobbed with Yavana-s through her mooing &#39;hums&#39;. [1-54-20b, 21a]"
1-54-20,"Then the earth was pervaded with the Shaka-s associated with Yavana-s, who have effectuation and bravery in overcoming their enemy forces, and who are golden in bodily colour similar to the golden pistils of flowers which complexion is outlandish. [1-54- 21b, 22a]"
1-54-21,"Yavana-s and Shaka-s, who are wielding bowie knives and broad lances and who are clad in golden coloured dresses, and who looked like glowing fires have completely burnt down entire force of Vishvamitra. [1-54-22, 23a]"
1-54-22,"Then that great-resplendent Vishvamitra indeed released his missiles, by which Yavana-s, Kaambhoja-s, and the Barbara-s, are rendered helter-skelter. Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra. [1-54-23b,c.]"
1-55-1,"Then on seeing the flurrying warriors earlier created by the Sacred Cow, Shabala, who are perplexed by the missiles of Vishvamitra, Vashishta started to motivate her, &#39;oh, wish-milker, generate more forces by your yogic capacity.&#39; Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration about the legend of Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-55-1]"
1-55-2,"From the &#39;hums&#39; of her mooing Kaamboja-s similar to sunshine are born, from her udder Pahlava-s wielding weaponry are born, from the area of her privates Yavana-s, likewise from her rectal area Shaka-s, and from her hair-roots Mleccha-s, Haariitaa-s along with Kirataka-s are issued forth. [1-55-2, 3]"
1-55-3,"At that very moment, oh, Rama the legatee of Raghu, Vishvamitra&#39;s army comprising foot-soldiers, elephants, chariots and horses is utterly slaughtered by the Yavana, Mleccha etc., forces generated by the Sacred Cow. [1-55-4]"
1-55-4,"On seeing their army utterly slaughtered by the vital spirit of Vashishta, a band of hundred sons of Vishvamitra wielding divers weapons exasperatedly sprinted forth towards that supreme meditator among all meditators. But that great sage Vashishta completely burnt all of them down just by blasting &#39;hum&#39; sounds. [1-55-5, 6]"
1-55-5,"That sage with vital spirit, Vashishta, then in a wink rendered those sons of Vishvamitra, along with their horses, chariots, and foot-soldiers to ashes. [1-55-7]"
1-55-6,"On seeing his sons and his forces are utterly ruined, that very highly glorious Vishvamitra was disgraced and beset by distress. [1-55-8]"
1-55-7,"Like a tideless ocean his warfare did not tide him over, like a fangless serpent his hiss of warring could not fang any, like a wingless bird pitiable is his flightless plight of fightback, like a shineless sun in an eclipse, Vishvamitra plunged into a lustreless state of his own illustriousness, when his forces are ruined along with his sons. [1-55-9, 10a]"
1-55-8,"When all his intrepidity and impetuosity are ruined an indolence bechanced upon him, and then on bidding one son for the kingdom, &#39;you rule the earth with the duties of kingcraft...&#39; thus saying Vishvamitra took recourse to forests. [1-55-10b, 11]"
1-55-9,"On going to the mountainsides of Himalayas, whereat it is adored by kinnaraa-s and uragaa-s, the nymphs and nymphean serpents, he that great practiser of ascesis, Vishvamitra, undertook an austere ascesis for the sake of beneficence of the Great God, Shiva. [1-55-12]"
1-55-10,"After a long lost time, Shiva, the God of Gods whose flag bears the sign of Holy Bull, has shown himself to that great-saint Vishvamitra, for He is a ready boon-giver. [1-55-13]"
1-55-11,"&#39;Oh, king, for which purpose you undertook this ascesis that you may tell me. What is it really intended by you and what boon you seek that be made known to me for I am the boon-giver.&#39; Shiva said so to Vishvamitra. [1-55-14]"
1-55-12,"Thus said by God Shiva to Vishvamitra of great ascesis, Vishvamitra on reverencing that Great God Shiva said this way. [1-55-15]"
1-55-13,"Oh! Mahadeva, the Impeccable Great God... providing that you are gladdened by my ascetic devotion,<font color=""#B3003A"">dhanurveda</font>, the Holy Writ of Archery, with its complemental and supplemental Writs, and along with its summational <font color="" #B3003A"">Upanishad-s</font>, together with its preternatural doctrines... they may kindly be bestowed upon me... [1-55-16]"
1-55-14,"&#39; Oh, Exquisite God, whichever missile is there either with gods, or fiends, gandharva-s, yaksha-s, and demons, let it dawn upon me. For you alone are the God of Gods your blessings alone can fulfil my aspiration.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra entreated God Shiva. [1-55-17, 18a]"
1-55-15,"&#39;So be it!&#39; On sanctifying Vishvamitra and his aspiration thus, the God of Gods, Shiva disappeared. [1-55-18b]"
1-55-16,"Vishvamitra who is already a mightier Kshatriya, now on acquiring missiles from the God of Gods, Shiva, will he not come forth paired up with mightiest conceit, and then will not his conceitedness be plethoric like a plethoric ocean? [1-55-19]"
1-55-17,"By vitality Vishvamitra is like an ocean with rough riptide on a Full Moon day, and oh, Rama, he deemed that sagaciously mighty sage Vashishta is now &#39;dead.&#39; [1-55-20]"
1-55-18,"Then on going to the threshold of Vashishta &#39;s hermitage that king propelled his missiles, by the holocaust of which missiles that ascetic woodland is completely burnt down in its entirety. [1-55-21]"
1-55-19,"On seeing the turbo-jetting missiles of Vishvamitra jetted by his sparkling intellect, hundreds of saints were frightened and they very speedily fled in hundreds of ways. [1-55-22]"
1-55-20,"Whoever is the disciple of Vashishta and whichever is either animal or a bird, all are utterly frightened and thousands of them have hastily fled to numerous directions. [1-55-23]"
1-55-21,"The threshold of that broad-minded Vashishta&#39;s hermitage fell void, and in a wink it has become silent like a burial ground as every shrub, herb and tree is cindery, and every bird, animal and stock is an evacuee. [1-55-24]"
1-55-22,"Although Vashishta shouted at them saying time and again, &#39;do not fear, do not fear... now I will dissipate that son of Gaadhi, Vishvamitra, like Sun demisting the mist,&#39; all the inmates of hermitage have hastily fled. [1-55-25]"
1-55-23,"On saying that way to the evacuees, Vashishta, the great-resplendent sage and a best one among best meditators rancorously said this word to Vishvamitra. [1-55-26]"
1-55-24,"You senseless king, by which reason you have havocked this hermitage that is well nourished for a long time by me, for that reason you have become a reprehensible one, and thereby you will not survive any longer. [1-55-27]"
1-55-25,"On saying thus that extremely infuriated Sage Vashishta post-hastily up-heaved his baton, which is alike the fumeless Ultimate Fire of End Time, and the other baton of Yama, the Terminator, and affronted Vishvamitra. Thus, Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend. [1-55-28]"
1-56-1,"When Vashishta spoke in this way, the great-mighty Vishvamitra brandishing Fiery-missile challenged Vashishta saying, withstand this, withstand this... Thus, sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend. [1-56-1]"
1-56-2,"That reverential sage Vashishta then upraising his Brahma-baton, which is like the other baton of the Terminator, spoke this sentence furiously. [1-56-2]"
1-56-3,"I am staying here only, you meritless Kshatriya, you may clearly display whatever prowess you have, oh, Gaadhi&#39;s son Vishvamitra, I will now ruin whatever vanity you or your missiles have. [1-56-3]"
1-56-4,"Where stands the force of belligerence when compared to the supreme force of sagacity, you abased Kshatriya, watch out for my strength of seraphic sagacity. So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra. [1-56-4]"
1-56-5,"With his baton of Brahma Vashishta silenced that matchless and deadly Fiery-missile of Gaadhi&#39;s son, namely Vishvamitra, as a deluge of water silencing a rage of fire. [1-56-5]"
1-56-6,"Vishvamitra, the son of Gaadhi then rancorously fusilladed the missiles regulated by gods like Varuna, Rudra, Indra, Paashupata, and even a missile which is projectile through grass blade called Ishiika. [1-56-6]"
1-56-7,"Vishvamitra also launched missiles named Humane, Rager, Stupefier, Hypnotiser, Yawner, Intoxicator, also thus Humidifier, Weep-inducer. [1-56-7]"
1-56-8,"He also launched the missiles called Drainer and Ripper, and the highly unconquerable Thunderbolt, even the lassos of Brahma, Time and Rain-gods. [1-56-8]"
1-56-9,"Also missiles called Shiva, Monster, Punisher, Wrester and like that the Baffler, Bolter, Drier, Drencher are launched. [1-56-9]"
1-56-10,"And he launched discs called the Discs of Virtue, Time and Vishnu and he also launched other missiles like the Blower, Stirrer and like that the missile with Horse-head. [1-56-10]"
1-56-11,"A pair of powers are launched, namely Power of Vishnu and the Power of Rudra, like that the Impeller, Crowbar, and a great missile called Staggerer, and then he launched the lethal missile of the Time. [1-56-11]"
1-56-12,"Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, Vishvamitra on triggering off all these missiles then he launched the deadly Trident, Skull and Torque missiles on Vashishta, and whole thing has became a spectacular display of Vishvamitra&#39;s arsenal. [1-56-12, 13a]"
1-56-13,"Brahma&#39;s son Vashishta defused all of those missiles just with his baton and when all of them are thus silenced, Gaadhi&#39;s son Vishvamitra touched off Brahma&#39;s missile. [1-56-13b, 14a]"
1-56-14,"When Vishvamitra brandished and set up Brahma missile for launching, seeing it all the gods keeping the Fire-god at their vanguard, godly sages, reptiles along with gandharva-s are perplexed, and the triad of worlds itself is perturbed. [1-56-14b, 15]"
1-56-15,"Even that deleteriously destructive Brahma&#39;s missile is completely consumed with the seraphic resplendence of Brahma-baton of Sage Vashishta. [1-56-16]"
1-56-16,"The appearance of that great-souled Vashishta became appallingly perplexing when he is finishing off that Brahma missile as if to surely petrify the Tri-world. [1-56-17]"
1-56-17,"From all of the pits of hair of that great-souled Vashishta ramified are the raditional beams and those radiated shafts are rolling up with the fumes of radiation, so to speak. [1-56-18]"
1-56-18,"The baton of Brahma gripped in his hand and upraised by Vashishta is highly glowing as if it is the fumeless inferno of Time, and as if it is the earthly baton of Yama, the Terminator. [1-56-19]"
1-56-19,"&#39;The assemblages of saints then extolled the best meditator Vashishta saying, &#39;oh, Brahman, infallible is your prowess, but bear this combustion of missile by your own combustive power. Though Vishvamitra is a supreme ascetic he is forestalled by you and your seraphic power, but this power of yours is equally anguishing all the worlds. Hence, let the worlds survive shooing away their anguish caused by your prowess. Oh, Brahman, be gracious, for you are the best among the best meditators...&#39; So said saints to Vashishta. [1-56-20, 21]"
1-56-20,"When that great-resplendent Vashishta is spoken thus by saints and gods he composed himself, and then that estranged Vishvamitra spoke this to himself with heavy suspiration. [1-56-22]"
1-56-21,"Fie upon the might of Kshatriya, mightier is the might of Brahman&#39;s resplendence, only with one baton of Brahma all of my missiles are defused. [1-56-23]"
1-56-22," &#39;Therefore on analysing this matter, I with my heart and senses quietened will embark on a sublime ascesis which really will be the causative factor for according Brahma-Sage-hood.&#39; So thought Vishvamitra... Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend. [1-56-24]"
1-57-1,"Oh, Raghava, on making that great-souled Vashishta an enemy, whenever Vishvamitra reminisced over his subdual by Vashishta, he is seethed at heart and heaved sighs repeatedly. Then on going to southern quarter with his prime queen, that great-ascetic Vishvamitra self-collectedly conducted a highly astounding ascesis subsisting only on fruits and tubers. Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend. [1-57-1, 2, 3a]"
1-57-2,"Then Vishvamitra begot sons named Havispanda, Madhuspnada, Dhridhanetra and Mahaaratha, who conduct themselves in candour and chivalry. [1-57-3]"
1-57-3,"At the close of one thousand years of ascesis Brahma, the Grandparent of all worlds, revealed Himself to Vishvamitra and spoke these words mellowly to ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra, &#39;oh, son of Kushika, Vishvamitra, you have won the worlds of kingly-sages by your ascesis.&#39; [1-57-4b, 5]"
1-57-4,"&#39;We indeed acquiesce you as a kingly-sage by your ascesis.&#39; saying so that great resplendent Brahma, the Supreme Ruler of the Worlds, went away to his Abode of Brahma, while the gods in Brahma&#39;s convoy went to Indra&#39;s Heaven. [1-57-6, 7a]"
1-57-5,"On hearing that Vishvamitra is down-faced with disgrace, and while high anguish prevailed over him, he rancorously soliloquised this. [1-57-7b, 8a]"
1-57-6,"&#39;Even though I have practised a very high ascesis, the gods together with the observances of hermits are recognising me just as a &#39;kingly-sage.&#39; Thereby I deem that there is no fruition to my ascesis.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra thought. [8b, 9a]"
1-57-7,"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, deciding in this way in his heart of hearts that self-willed Vishvamitra again undertook a supreme ascesis as he is a great-ascetic. [1-57-9]"
1-57-8,"In this meantime there is a veracious king named Trishanku, an enhancer of Ikshvaku dynasty, and one renowned for his self-conquest. [1-57-10b, 11a]"
1-57-9,"Oh, Raghava, an idea sprang up in the mind of Trishanku to perform a ritual by which he will go to heaven with his own body. Then he sincerely invited Vashishta and told him what his thinking is. [1-57-11b, 12]"
1-57-10,"But the great-souled Vashishta said it as impossible. Thus repudiated Trishanku went to southerly direction in search of orchestrators for the purpose of realising that task, such a phantasmal ritual that enables him to go to heaven with his body, and that king has gone to the sons of Vashishta. [1-57-13, 14a]"
1-57-11,"Trishanku has indeed gone to the place where the sons of Vashishta are protractedly expiating, and there he visited the hundred noble-souled sons of Vashishta, who are supremely self-luminescent and superbly self-refulgent by their ascesis. [1-57-14b, 15]"
1-57-12,"On reaching nigh of those noble-souled sons of the indoctrinator, namely Vashishta, Trishanku reverenced all of them sequentially according to their age, but with a little down- faced owing to abashment, and spoke to all of those great-souled ones making palm-fold in supplication. [1-57-16]"
1-57-13,"I have come as a shelter-seeker seeking the shelter of yours as you are the shelterers of the needy, you all be safe, as the great-souled Vashishta has repudiated me. [1-57-17b, 18a]"
1-57-14,"I am longing to perform an unusual ritual and it will be apt of you to give assent to it. Reverencing all of the sons of my mentor Vashishta I am proposing this to you. [1-57-18b, 19]"
1-57-15,"With reverence I truckle before you all Brahmans who are abiding in ascesis. Such as you are I beg you to assiduously get a ritual performed through me, as to how I can get to heaven with my body. [1-57-19b, 20]"
1-57-16,"Oh, ascetically wealthy Brahmans, as I am repudiated by Vashishta, I do not perceive another recourse excepting you, who are all the sons of mentor Vashishta. [1-57-21]"
1-57-17," &#39;The Priest is the ultimate recourse for all of the kings in Ikshvaku dynasty, isn&#39;t it. Therefore, next to Vashishta you are all the next-best gods to me.&#39; Thus Trishanku entreated the hundred sons of Sage Vashishta. Sage Shataananda thus continued narration. [1-57-22]"
1-58-1,"On hearing the sentence of Trishanku, oh, Rama, the hundred sons of sage Vashishta infuriately said this to that king. Thus, sage Shataananda continued his narration to Rama and others. [1-58-1]"
1-58-2,"&#39;You slow-witted king, your veracious mentor has denounced you. But transgressing him how do you approach another branch of the same tree of wisdom, when that very tree rejected you?&#39; So the sons of Vashishta have started to denounce Trishanku. [1-58-2]"
1-58-3,"&#39;The Royal Priest is the ultimate course for all of Ikshvaku-s, isn&#39;t it. It is impossible to transgress the word of advise of such a veracious Priest. [1-58-3]"
1-58-4,"Vashishta is the most reverential sage and such a sage has already said it is impossible to conduct such a Vedic-ritual. Then, in which way we are capable to conduct such a Vedic-ritual? [1-58-4]"
1-58-5,"&#39;Oh king of subjects, better get back to your own city again for you are childish. That godlike Vashishta alone is capable to orchestrate any ritual by any king in all the three worlds. Oh, king, how then we are capable to cause a disrepute to his reputation.&#39; Thus, the sons of Vashishta refuted Trishanku. [1-58-5, 6a]"
1-58-6,"On hearing that sentence of theirs which is highly faltering with words of fury that king further spoke this sentence to all of them. So Shataananda continued. [1-58-6b, 7a]"
1-58-7,"&#39;I am indeed rejected by the godlike Vashishta, likewise even by you, the sons of the same mentor, as such oh, ascetically wealthy scholars, in this state obloquy I will resort to another recourse, let safety betide you.&#39; So Trishanku bade farewell to the sons of Vashishta, but... [1-58-7b, 8a]"
1-58-8,"But the sons of the sage Vashishta, on hearing that sentence of the king, that is inclusive of and leading to a calamitous situation, have become very highly infuriated and cursed saying, &#39;you shall get into a state of basely profaner.&#39; That is the curse issued by the sons of Vashishta to Trishanku. [1-58-8b, 9a]"
1-58-9,"On saying thus those great-souled sons of Vashishta withdrew to one&#39;s own hermitage and when that night elapsed into day then the king lapsed into a state of basely profaner. [1-58-9b, 10a]"
1-58-10,"He is now wearing blackish cloths which on yestereve were ochry silks, he is now a blackamoor who on yestereve was a gilt-royalty, his head-hair is shaggy which earlier was silkily soft, and his royal garlands which were richly fragrant are now funeral wreaths, and he is besmeared with crematory ashes which were regal emollients, and his royal jewellery is now rendered into iron adornments. [1-58-10b, 11a]"
1-58-11,"On seeing him in the mien of a profaner, oh, Rama, all of his ministers and the subjects and his own retinue have deserted him and took to flight in masses. [1-58-11b, 12a]"
1-58-12,"Though that resolutely self-assured king seethed for one night and day for this mishap, then went to the ascetically prosperous Vishvamitra. [1-58-12b, 13a]"
1-58-13,"But on seeing at that mien of the king which is rendered to that of a precluded profaner from kingship and for officiating rituals etc., oh, Rama, sage Vishvamitra because sympathetic. [1-58-13b, 14a]"
1-58-14,"The great-resplendent sage and highly generous Vishvamitra firstly said to that king who is in a terrible aspect &#39;let safety betide you,&#39; and then spoke on this sentence to him. [1-58-14b, 15a]"
1-58-15,"&#39;What is the purpose of your visit, oh, great-mighty prince Trishanku, oh, brave lord of Ayodhya, you are accurst to the state of profaner.&#39; [1-58-15b, 16a]"
1-58-16,"Then that king who is accurst to a state of profaner on listening that sentence, as a diligent sentence maker spoke this sentence with his palms adjoined to the sententious sage Vishvamitra. [1-58-16b, 17a]"
1-58-17,"I am spurned off by my mentor Vashishta and also like that by his sons. My aspiration remained unachievable, besides, this discrepancy has bechanced upon me. [1-58-17b, 18a]"
1-58-18,"&#39;Oh, gentle Vishvamitra, my aspiration is nothing but to go to heaven with my body. I have performed hundred rituals but I have not achieved the fruit.&#39; Thus Trishanku started tell his sad tale."
1-58-19,"And now if you doubt me to be a liar, I am no liar either. I spoke no lie heretofore, and even if I were to land into any predicament I do not speak lies anytime hereinafter. Oh, gentle sage, this I pledge you upon my virtue of Kshatriya-hood. [1-58-19, 20a]"
1-58-20,"I have propitiated gods with many kinds of Vedic-rituals. I have reigned over people conscientiously. And with my conduct and comport the high-souled savants are also pleased. [1-58-20b, 21a]"
1-58-21,"While I am a pursuant in probity I expect to avail myself of the fruition of this kind of Vedic-ritual. Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, but my mentors are not deriving complete contentment by my pursuit. Hence, they shove me off. [1-58-21b, 22a]"
1-58-22,"I deem destiny is the only ultimate, and manly efforts are meaningless, for destiny surmounts everything. Destiny is the ultimate course, isn&#39;t it? [1-58-22b, 23a]"
1-58-23,"A highly anguished endeavourer, marred by destiny, a sincere requester, such as I am, it will be apt of you to accord, you be safe, your favour upon me. [1-58-23b, c]"
1-58-24," &#39;In no alternate course I wish to course through and no alternative shelter is there for me. Hence, it will be apt of you, a god in man&#39;s mien, to countervail my destiny.&#39; Thus Trishanku prayed for the grace of Vishvamitra... So said Sage Shataananda to Rama and others continuing the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-58-24]"
1-59-1,"Vishvamitra, the son of Kushi, piteously spoke this mellowly sentence to king Trishanku who spoke thus, and who in reality attained a state of profaner. Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-59-1]"
1-59-2,"Oh, Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s, you are welcome. I am aware that you are a highly righteous king. Oh, the best king, you need not be dismayed, for I accord you haven. [1-59-2]"
1-59-3,"I will invite all the sages with pious activities who will render assistance in the ritual, oh, king, then you can perform the ritual self-composedly. [1-59-3]"
1-59-4,"You can go to heaven with this body of yours, as well as with the form which is deformed by the curse of mentor Vashishta through his sons. [1-59-4]"
1-59-5,"&#39;I deem that heaven is handy to you, oh, king of subjects, as you have approached the all-sheltering Vishvamitra and sought shelter.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra solaced Trishanku. [1-59-5]"
1-59-6,"On saying thus to Trishanku that great-resplendent Vishvamitra ordered his highly righteous and astutely brilliant sons to organise the arrangements for the ritual. [1-59-6]"
1-59-7,"Vishvamitra calling forth all of his disciples said this sentence, &#39;oh boys invite all the eminent sages who are well-read in many Veda-s, along with their disciples and friends, and their ritwiks, the conductors of rituals at my order.&#39; [1-59-7, 8a]"
1-59-8,"&#39;If someone speaks inconsiderately incited by the forcefulness of my word, whoever speaks it, whichever word it may be, all that is to be reported to me, whatever it is.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra ordered his disciples. [1-59-8]"
1-59-9,"On listening that word of Vishvamitra his disciples went to all directions inviting all by his order, and then the Vedic scholars started to arrive from all provinces. [1-59-9 b, 10a]"
1-59-10,"All of the disciples have returned to the fulgently resplendent sage Vishvamitra, and reported the words spoken by all the Vedic scholars. [1-59-10b, 11a]"
1-59-11,"&#39;On listening your word all the Brahmans from all provinces have started to come and some have already come, leaving alone Mahodaya, the son of Vashishta.&#39; Thus, the disciples have started to inform Vishvamitra. [1-59-11b, 12a]"
1-59-12,"What all said by those hundred sons of Vashishta is explosively worded in their fury, oh, eminent sage, and what all they have said that you may please listen. [1-59-12b, 13a]"
1-59-13,"&#39;A Kshatriya is the officiator, and a profaner is the performer. How then the gods or sages can partake of the remnants of oblations in that ritual-assembly, especially that of a profaner?&#39; Thus, the sons of Vashishta exclaimed. [1-59-13b, 14a]"
1-59-14,"Though the Brahmans or the high-souled sages are now embarrassed by Vishvamitra, how can they go to heaven even after their demise, partaking of the food of a profaner? [1-59-14b, 15a]"
1-59-15,"&#39;Oh, tigerly sage Vishvamitra, all the sons of Vashishta including Mahodaya spoke these derisive sentences with their eyes reddening in anger.&#39; Thus, the disciples reported to Vishvamitra. [1-59-15b, 16a]"
1-59-16,"The eminent sage Vishvamitra having heard those words of the sons of Vashishta from all of his disciples, said this rancorously with bloodshot eyes. [1-59-16b, 17a]"
1-59-17,"He who reproves me, who am abiding in rigorous ascesis, and who am an unreprovable one by my ascetic merit, that irreverent person will be reduced to ashes, and there is no doubt about it. [1-59-17b, 18a]"
1-59-18,"Now they will be dragged by the lasso of Time to the House of Yama, the Terminator, and from now to seven hundred births to come they take birth as devourers of corpses, come what may. [1-59-18b, 19a]"
1-59-19,"Those who reprove me will be wandering about these mortal worlds on taking birth as disfigured and deformed beings in the ruthless sect of Mustika-s that always feed on dog&#39;s flesh. [1-59-19b, 20a]"
1-59-20,"That wrong-headed Mahodaya also reproached me, who am irreproachable on my part, hence he gets into tribal-hood and becomes a reproachable tribal for the entire world. [1-59-20b, 21a]"
1-59-21,"By my fury he obtains an utter barbarity and he will be occupied with a murderous bent, and he cycles through a worst possible living for a long time. [1-59-21b, 22a]"
1-59-22,"On saying this much sentence of curse among the sages who have already arrived, that great-resplendent, greatly ascetic, great sage Vishvamitra paused. [1-59-22]"
1-60-1,"The great-resplendent Vishvamitra on knowing through his ascetic power about the ruination of the sons of Vashishta, along with Mahodaya, proclaimed this amidst the observance of sages. Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Trishanku&#39;s legend. [1-60-1]"
1-60-2,"&#39;This legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty is well-know as Trishanku, a righteous and benevolent one. He came under my shelter as he wishes to win over the heaven of gods with his own mortal body.&#39; So Vishvamitra started to speak to sages. [1-60-2, 3b]"
1-60-3,"&#39;You all scholars have to conduct Vedic-ritual along with in such a way as to how Trishnaku reaches the heaven of gods.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra advised the conductors of the ritual. [1-60-3b, 4a]"
1-60-4,"On listening the words of Vishvamitra all those great-sages have come together and quickly discussed among themselves about what is agreeable to righteousness, as they are the knowers of scruples of conducting Vedic-rituals, but such a ritual is desultory. [1-60-4b, 5a]"
1-60-5,"Whatever Vishvamitra says let it be translated entirely and exhaustively into deeds called ritual. This Vishvamitra is the legatee of Sage Kushi, and indeed he is a saint similar to Ritual-fire besides being an extremely furious person. Otherwise this awesome sage gives curse, rancorously. [1-60-5b, 6]"
1-60-6,"&#39;As such, let the Vedic-ritual be conducted intending and enabling Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku, to go to heaven by the ritualist prowess of Vishvamitra, therefor you conduct yourselves and you all preside over it.&#39; Thus, the officiators conceded among themselves. [1-60-7, 8a]"
1-60-7,"Concluding thus those great-sages undertook concerned works of that Vedic-ritual and the great-resplendent Vishvamitra himself became its principal officiator. [1-60-8b, 9a]"
1-60-8,"Those hymnodists who are the experts in hymnodies have scripturally carried out all ceremonies in a methodical way with inviolable hymnal methods, and as per Kalpa treatise, that lays down the rules for conducting such rituals. [1-60-9b, 10a]"
1-60-9,"After a long time that highly ascetical Vishvamitra welcomed all the gods to receive their allotted oblations in that ritual. [1-60-10b, 11a]"
1-60-10,"Then all of the gods who are invited to partake of the oblation have not come forward to receive their allotments, and then the great-saint Vishvamitra, obsessive with fury, furiously lifted up a wooden-oblational-scoop, and said this to Trishanku. [1-60-11b, 12]"
1-60-11,"Oh, ruler of people, now you shall see the potency of my ascesis which I personally achieved. Such as I am I shall lead you forth to haven with your own body just by my personal capability. Oh, king of people, now you will go to heaven with your own mortal body, which is otherwise unattainable. [1-60-13, 14a]"
1-60-12,"&#39;May it be a little, but there is some fruit of my ascesis, isn&#39;t it! Oh, king, you will journey to heaven with your own body owing to that prowess of my ascesis.&#39; Vishvamitra said so to Trishanku. [1-60-14b, 15a]"
1-60-13,"Once the sage Vishvamitra said those words, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, that king Trishanku soared to heaven with his mortal body, before the very eyes of other sages. Sage Shataananda continued. [1-60-15b, 16a]"
1-60-14,"On seeing Trishanku&#39;s entry into the realm of heaven, Indra, the subjugator of demon Paaka, spoke this sentence together with all the multitudes of gods. [1-60-16b, 17a]"
1-60-15,"Oh, Trishanku, you have not yet made heaven as your haunt, hence retrace your steps. As you are thrashed by the damning of your mentor Vashishta, you inane human, again fall down on earth, but with your head inversed. [1-60-17b, 18a]"
1-60-16,"When Mahendra said so, Trishanku loudly exclaiming at the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra saying, &#39;save me, save me,&#39; and fell down from heaven. [1-60-18b, 19a]"
1-60-17,"On hearing the exclamatory sentence of Trishanku who is shouting it loudly, Vishvamitra assumed an abnormal anger and also said, &#39;wait... wait...&#39; [1-60-19b, 20a]"
1-60-18,"Like the other Creator that resplendent Vishvamitra, himself staying among sages, has replicated Southerly Ursa Major in southerly direction. And still remaining amidst of sages that highly reputed sage Vishvamitra further started to replicate the stereotyped stocks of stars sequentially, resorting to the southern hemisphere, as he is convulsed in anger at Indra. [1-60-20b, 21, 22a]"
1-60-19,"On replicating the stereotyped stocks of other galaxies and stars, and while fury continued to blemish him Vishvamitra said, &#39;I will now clone an alternative Indra, or let that realm created by me remain without any Indra,&#39; and when he is about to proceed to clone even gods in his wrath, the gods are startled. [1-60-22b, 23]"
1-60-20,"The gods are highly startled at Vishvamitra&#39;s creation, and they along with demons and with observances of hermits addressed the great-souled Vishvamitra with placatory words. [1-60-24]"
1-60-21,"&#39;Oh great-fortunate Vishvamitra, this king Trishnaku is damned by his mentor, hence oh, ascetically wealthy sage, he is not at all eligible to go to heaven with his mortal body.&#39; So said gods to Vishvamitra. [1-60-25]"
1-60-22,"On hearing that sentence of those gods, the eminent saint Kaushika spoke this highly laudable sentence to all of the gods. [1-60-26]"
1-60-23,"Let safety betide you all. I have promised to this king Trishanku that he will ascend to heaven with his mortal body, and I am not interested to make it untrue. [1-60-27]"
1-60-24,"&#39;Let there be eternal heaven to Trishanku with his mortal body. Next, as along as the worlds remain, let all of these stars and galaxies I have created also remain eternally in their places as my creation. It will be apt of you all gods to accede to this.&#39; So said Vishvamitra to gods. [1-60-28, 29]"
1-60-25,"When all the gods are addressed thus they replied the eminent saint Vishvamitra saying, &#39;so be it! Safe you be! Let all the created objects prevail in their respective places. Those amazing and numerous stars you have created will remain in firmament, but outside the path of stelliform of Cosmic Person. Trishanku will also remain in the circle of stars you created, but upside-down, for Indra&#39;s indict cannot be annulled, and he will be gleaming like a star and similar to any celestial. [1-60-30, 31, 32a]"
1-60-26,"&#39;According to their wont to circumambulate someone who has gone to heavenly worlds, all the stars will suppliantly circumambulate this best king Trishanku, who has achieved his ends and who has become an acclaimed one with your tour de force.&#39; So said gods to Vishvamitra in deterring his further cloning of a simulative Universe. [1-60-32b, 33a]"
1-60-27,"Even the benign-souled Vishvamitra, when reverenced by all gods, that great-resplendent sage without stirring himself from among the sages said to all gods, &#39;Agreed!&#39; [1-60-33]"
1-60-28,"Oh, best one among men Rama, later at the end of that ritual great-souled gods and ascetically wealthy sages went away as they have come. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the narration of the legend. [1-60-34]"
1-61-1,"Oh, tigerly man Rama, on giving farewell to those sages who came at his invitation and who have started to go back after the ritual of Trishanku is over, then that great-resplendent Vishvamitra spoke to all of the sages who are forest dwellers that remained with him. Thus Shatananda continued to narrate the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-61-1]"
1-61-2,"While depending on this southern quarter this gross hindrance has cropped up for my ascesis in the shape of Trishanku&#39;s ascent to heaven, hence we will go to another direction, and there we continue ascesis. [1-61-2]"
1-61-3,"&#39;Oh, great-souled sages, we can conveniently undertake our ascesis in the vast of westerly direction where holy lakesides are there. That would be an august ascetical forest, isn&#39;t it.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra said to fellow sages in his camp. [1-61-3]"
1-61-4,"On saying thus that most brilliant and great saint Vishvamitra performed an unhindered and rigorous ascesis subsisting only on fruits and tubers after reaching the lakeside of holy lakes. [1-61-4]"
1-61-5,"In the meanwhile the great king of Ayodhya, renowned as Ambariisha, embarked on to perform a Vedic-ritual. [1-61-5]"
1-61-6,"But Indra impounded the animal of the principal of that ritual, namely king Ambariisha, and when that animal is really vanished, the officiant Brahman of the ritual spoke this to that king. [1-61-6]"
1-61-7,"Oh, king, the animal you have fetched for the ritual has gone astray owing to your incautiousness. Oh, king, unguarded items of the ritual will themselves become destructive blemishes for that king who is performing the ritual. [1-61-7]"
1-61-8,"&#39;Oh, the best man among men, you have to make great amends for the loss of animal as that animal alone which was intended but now missing shall be used in ritual. Or, a man may be fetched as ritual-animal, and only after that the deeds of the ritual can be continued.&#39; Thus, the priests of the ritual said to king Ambariisha. [1-61-8]"
1-61-9,"On hearing the words of his teacher, oh, the best one among men, Rama, he that highly rule-obedient king tried for a human-ritual-animal for a barter of thousands of cows. [1-61-9]"
1-61-10,"While that king is searching those and those provinces, villages, forests, townships, and even the pious hermitages, oh, dear Rama, the legatee of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, that king has indeed seen Sage Riciika, who is well settled on Mt. Bhrigutunga along with his sons and wife. [1-61-10, 11]"
1-61-11,"On reverencing and on obtaining the grace of ascetically brilliant great Sage Riciika, and even on asking him about his wellbeing in every aspect, that kingly sage Ambariisha, who is with great resplendence and whose brilliance is illimitable, said this word to that sage. [1-61-12, 13a]"
1-61-12,"Oh, godlike sage, if you bargain your son with a hundred thousand cows for the purpose of a ritual-animal, oh, the successor Sage Bhrigu, I deem my ends are achieved. [1-61-13b, 14a]"
1-61-13,"&#39;All the provinces are went over but unobtainable is that animal of the ritual, hence it will be apt of you to give me one son from among your sons, for a value.&#39; Thus, king Ambariisha bargained with the sage. [1-61-14b, 15a]"
1-61-14,"When that great-resplendent Sage Riciika is addressed thus, he said this word, &#39;oh, best of men, I cannot possibly sell my eldest son, in anyway.&#39; [1-61-15b, 16a]"
1-61-15,"On hearing the words of Sage Riciika the mother of those great-souled sons spoke this word to the tigerly-man Ambariisha. [1-61-16b, 17a]"
1-61-16,"The most reverential sage and the one from Bhaargava dynasty, my husband, said that the eldest son is un-sellable. Thereof oh, lord, you must know that my youngest son, namely Shunaka, is a cherished one for me. Therefore oh, king, I will not give my youngest son to you, either. [1-61-17b, 18]"
1-61-17," &#39;Generally eldest sons are fathers&#39; favourites, oh, best king among men, and mothers&#39; favourites are the youngest, isn&#39;t it! Therefor, I have to tend my youngest son.&#39; Thus, wife Sage Ruciika said to Ambariisha. [1-61-19]"
1-61-18,"Oh, Rama, when that sage&#39;s sentence is so, and his wife&#39;s sentence is also in that way only, their intermediate son, namely Shunashepa, personally spoke this sentence. [1-61-20]"
1-61-19,"Father said that the eldest son is un-sellable, mother also said the same about youngest one. Then I deem that the intermediary son is sellable. Hence, oh, prince, you may lead me forth. [1-61-21]"
1-61-20,"Oh, dextrous Rama, when that advocate of Veda-s, namely Shunashepa finished his speech, then the king gave gold, silver, and gemstones, each in ten million heaps, and even a hundred thousand cows, and oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, that king Ambariisha went away highly gladdened to take Shunashepa with him. [1-61-22, 23]"
1-61-21,"That great resplendent and highly renowned king Ambariisha on his part proceeded hastily after ascending Shunashepa onto the chariot that hastily. Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-61-24]"
1-62-1,"Oh, Rama, the best one among men and the legatee of Raghu, on taking Shunashepa that highly renowned king Ambariisha took rest at noontime on the lakeside of Holy Lake. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shunashepa, as a part of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend. [1-62-1]"
1-62-2,"While the king Ambariisha is taking rest that highly brilliant Shunashepa came to the lakeside of main Holy Lake with high anxiety, and there he indeed saw his maternal uncle Sage Vishvamitra who is performing ascesis along with other sages. [1-62-2, 3a]"
1-62-3,"Shunashepa became pitiable and sulky faced by strain and thirst, oh, Rama, and he immediately fell in the lap of saint Vishvamitra saying this sentence. [1-62-3b, 4a]"
1-62-4,"I have no mother or a father to save me. Then wherefore cousins or relatives will be there to protect me. Oh, peaceable saint the eminent, it will be apt of you to protect me according to saintliness. [1-62-4b, 5a]"
1-62-5,"Oh, illustrious sage, you alone are the saviour to each and every one, isn&#39;t it! You alone are the guardian angel, isn&#39;t it! Hence, let the purpose of the king Ambariisha be achieved, and let longevity come to me, and I on becoming imperishable and indeed on performing an unexcelled ascesis, I wish to enjoy in heavenly worlds. [1-62-5b, 6]"
1-62-6,"&#39; You shall be my providence with a providential sentiment as I stand unprotected, and oh, virtue souled one, it will be apt of you to protect me from misfortune, like a father protecting his own son.&#39; Thus Shunashepa appealed to Vishvamitra. [1-62-7]"
1-62-7,"On hearing that sentence of Shunashepa and on pacifying him in many ways, Vishvamitra of higher ascesis, indeed said this to his sons. [1-62-8]"
1-62-8,"For what reason parents engender sons, desiring positivity and for the purpose of welfare in the other worlds, this is the time that has come for fulfilling that reason. [1-62-9]"
1-62-9,"This youngster is the son of sage and he aspires shelter from me. Hence, oh, sons, give him satisfaction just by giving life to him. [1-62-10]"
1-62-10,"You all have done very good pious deeds and you all abide by probity. Hence, you bestow appeasement to Fire-god on your becoming the ritual-animals of king Ambariisha in lieu of this boy Shunashepa. [1-62-11]"
1-62-11,"&#39;As a result, Shunashepa will have protectors, Vedic-ritual will be unimpeded, gods will be oblated, and my word too will be actualised.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra said to his sons. [1-62-12]"
1-62-12,"But on hearing the saying of the sage, oh, Rama, the best of men, Madhushyanda and the other sons of Vishvamitra said this, haughtily and disparagingly. [1-62-13]"
1-62-13,"&#39;On sacrificing your own sons how can you save another&#39;s son, oh, lordly father, we deem this as a wrongdoing and as good as dog&#39;s meat in a dinner.&#39; Thus the sons of Vishvamitra replied their father. [1-62-14]"
1-62-14,"On listening that saying of his sons that eminent sage Vishvamitra started to curse them while fury reddened his eyes. [1-62-15]"
1-62-15,"You all have not only transgressed my word, but pertly replied me in an impudent manner which is abhorrent and hair-raising, and recriminatory according to probity. [1-62-16]"
1-62-16,"&#39;You all will be whirling around the earth totally for a thousand years taking birth in the race that subsists on dog&#39;s meat, like the sons of Vashishta.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra cursed his sons. [1-62-17]"
1-62-17,"On making his sons bounden by curse, then that best saint spoke to the pitiable Shunashepa, on making unharmed invulnerability to him with sanctifying hymns. [1-62-18]"
1-62-18,"When you are fastened with sacred fastener to the sacrificial post of Vishnu, smeared with red paste and garlanded with red garlands, you praisefully address the Fire-god with the words I going to impart to you in Vedic hymns. [1-62-19]"
1-62-19,"&#39;These two divine hymns, oh, son of saint, shall be chanted in the Vedic-ritual of Ambariisha, then you will obtain your aspiration.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra taught two Vedic hymns to the boy. [1-62-20]"
1-62-20,"Shunashepa having taken those two hymns from Vishvamitra very attentively has instantly gone to that lion-king Ambariisha and indeed spoke to him. [1-62-21]"
1-62-21,"&#39;Oh, the lion-king, let us go promptly to your ritual place, oh, best king, you may apply yourself to your pledge in completing the ritual, with me as its sacrificial animal,&#39; thus the boy said. [1-62-22]"
1-62-22,"On listening that sentence of the son of sage, the king Ambariisha is gladdened and proceeded to the ritual hall immediately and spiritedly. [1-62-23]"
1-62-23,"The king with the permission of officiators of ritual got the boy prepared as a ritual animal with sanctified bodily features and clad him in red clothes and got him securely fastened to the sacrificial post. [1-62-24]"
1-62-24,"When Shunashepa is tied to ritual post he immensely pleased two gods, namely Indra and Upendra as well, with those two hymns he got from Vishvamitra. [1-62-25]"
1-62-25,"Then the Thousand-eyed Indra who is satisfied with esoteric laudation is gladdened, and oh, Raghava, then he bestowed longevity to Shunashepa. [1-62-26]"
1-62-26,"Oh, Rama, the best one among men, he that king Ambariisha also obtained the fruits of that Vedic-ritual in manyfold, resulted from the grace of Thousand-eyed Indra. [1-62-27]"
1-62-27,"Oh, Rama, the best among men, even the virtue-souled great ascetic Vishvamitra again performed ascesis at the same Holy lakeside for another thousand years. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend. [1-62-28]"
1-63-1,"When thousand years are completed in ascesis and when that great saint Vishvamitra took a bath of solemnity, all the gods have come forward wishing to accord the fruit of that ascesis to Vishvamitra. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-63-1]"
1-63-2,"The very highly resplendent Brahma spoke to him with highly palatable words, &#39;you have now become a kingly sage by virtue of auspicious deeds you have personally undertaken, let safeness betide you.&#39; [1-63-2]"
1-63-3,"On speaking to Vishvamitra in that way Brahma returned to heaven, and that highly vigorous Vishvamitra again performed a great ascesis. [1-63-3]"
1-63-4,"Then at a long lost time Menaka, the prominent apsara, celestial wench, has arrived and started to swim for sport in that holy lake. [1-63-4]"
1-63-5,"That great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has seen Menaka who is incomparable in her mien and comparable to an electric-flash in a black-cloud, while she is swimming in the holy lake. [1-63-5]"
1-63-6,"On seeing her the sage having gone under the sway the Love-god said this to her, &#39;oh, apsara, you are welcome, I invite you to bide in my hermitage. Oblige me who am bewitched by Love-god for you. You be safe.&#39; [1-63-6, 7a]"
1-63-7,"When he said thus to her, oh, Raghava, then she made a stopover there and ten years rolled by comfortably, and oh, gentle Rama, because of her staying Vishvamitra is indeed faced with a great hindrance in his ascesis. [1-63-7b, 8, 9a]"
1-63-8,"Then after the lapse of that ten year period Vishvamitra became doleful with distress and he is enwrapped in humiliation, as it were, and, oh, Rama, Raghu&#39;s legatee, then a resentful thought occurred to him. [1-63-9b, 10]"
1-63-9,"All this is the mischief of gods to defraud me of the great merit of my ascesis. Ten years have rolled by as if they are just a day and a night. Furthermore, I who am under the influence of lust and lure had to encounter this hindrance in my ascesis. [1-63-11, 12a]"
1-63-10,"Oh, Rama, that best saint suspired heavily when he became emotional with reparation. But on seeing the scared celestial wench Menaka, who is shivering and waiting with suppliantly adjoined palms, he sent her away with pleasant words, and he that Vishvamitra indeed went to the northern Himalayan mountain. [1-63-12b, 13, 14a]"
1-63-11,"He that highly celebrated sage who made a resolve to attain a sang-froid temperament and to vanquish lust, performed an unsurpassable ascesis on reaching the riverbank of River Kaushiki. [1-63-14b, 15a]"
1-63-12,"Oh, Rama, while he reverently performed an unspeakable ascesis for a thousand years on the northern mountain, namely Himalayas, then fear occurred to gods. [1-63-15b, 16a]"
1-63-13,"&#39; All gods coming together with assemblages of sages have approached Brahma and conveyed that, &#39;this Vishvamitra, the son of Kushika, may duly be given the epithet of &#39;Maharshi, Exalted Sage.&#39; [1-63-16b, 17a]"
1-63-14,"On listening the advice of gods, Brahma, the Grandparent of all the worlds, spoke these pleasant words to the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra. [1-63-17b, 18a]"
1-63-15,"&#39;Oh, exalted sage, I welcome you my dear, as I am gladdened by your stern ascesis, oh, Kaushika, I bestow upon you the sublimity and supremacy among sages.&#39; [1-63-18b, 19a]"
1-63-16,"And on hearing the words of Brahma he that ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra became obeisant and replied the Grandparent adjoining his palms suppliantly. [1-63-19b, 20a]"
1-63-17,"&#39;If your Godhead had said that I am a Brahma-sage, a sageship acquired personally by my pious deeds, rather than an exalted sage, then I would have become one who is really self-conquered.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra said to Brahma. [1-63-20, 21a]"
1-63-18,"Brahma then said to him, &#39;your senses remain unconquered as such, oh, tigerly sage, make an effort for it.&#39; Saying so Brahma went heavenward. [1-63-21b, 22a]"
1-63-19,"While the gods who came here along with Brahma have returned, that great sage Vishvamitra undertook another round of ascesis by standing in levitation, upraising his arms, and subsisting on air alone. [1-63-22b, 23a]"
1-63-20,"In summer he became the Five-Fire Ascetic, in rainy season open sky is his rooftop, and in winter water is his reclining bed even by day or by night, and thus that ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra indeed undertook a severe ascesis in this way, for another thousand years. [1-63-23b, 24]"
1-63-21,"While that great saint is undertaking fervent ascesis it has become a very high burning problem to gods and even to Indra. [1-63-25]"
1-63-22,"Then Indra along with all the assemblages of the Air-gods spoke to Rambha, the celestial wench, words that are advantageous to himself, but disadvantageous to the son of sage Kushi, namely Vishvamitra. Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration. [1-63-26]"
1-64-1,"Oh, Rambha, now you have to undertake this very great task of gods in enchanting Vishvamitra with a craving caused by lust, for lusting after you.&#39; Thus Indra ordered Rambha... Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-64-1]"
1-64-2,"Oh, Rama, when that celestial wench is spoken thus by the Thousand-eyed Indra, she diffidently said to that chief of gods while adjoining her palms suppliantly. [1-64-2]"
1-64-3,"&#39;Oh, chief of gods, Indra, that great saint Vishvamitra is a dangerous one and undoubtedly he releases his deadly anger on me. Oh, god, thereby I am fearful of him. Hence, oh, god, it will be apt of you to accord forbearance.&#39; So said Rambha to Indra. [1-64-3, 4a]"
1-64-4,"Oh, Rama, the Thousand-eyed Indra replied Rambha when she spoke to him in that way while shuddering in fear and making palm fold in supplication. [1-64-4b, 5a]"
1-64-5,"You need not be fearful, Rambha, carry out my command, safe betides you, I on becoming a heart-stealing black-songbird will be at your side along with Love-god in the pleasing trees of springtime. [1-64-5b, 6]"
1-64-6,"&#39;Indeed on your assuming a highly sparkling semblance, and multi-multiplexing your savoir faire, with bon viveurs and bon vivants, you disengage that ascetical sage Kaushika from his ascesis.&#39; So said Indra to Rambha. [1-64-7]"
1-64-7,"On hearing the sentence of Indra she adopted an unexcelled physique, and on becoming a pulchritudinous damsel she started to entice Vishvamitra with giggly grins. [1-64-8]"
1-64-8,"Vishvamitra has heard melodious trilling tune of songbird, and while his heart is highly gladdening about the ambience, he incidentally saw and stared at Rambha. [1-64-9]"
1-64-9,"By the exceptional trilling tune of that songbird and by the unexceptional tableau of Rambha the sage is on his qui vive. [1-64-10]"
1-64-10,"On knowing that as an escapade of the Thousand-eyed Indra, Vishvamitra is enwrapped in wrath and he cursed Rambha. [1-64-11]"
1-64-11,"Whereof you tried to entice me who am wishing to win over the wanton and wroth, you unlucky female Rambha, thereof you will become a rocklike statued wastrel. [1-64-12]"
1-64-12,"&#39;A highly resplendent Brahman who is ascetically powerful redeems you, oh, Rambha, who are now blemished by my anger.&#39; Vishvamitra cursed Rambha in this way. [1-64-13]"
1-64-13,"Thus the great-resplendent Vishvamitra became compunctious when that great-saint could not contain his anger in uttering an angry curse. [1-64-14]"
1-64-14,"Then Rambha has become a rocklike statue by that great curse of Vishvamitra, and having heard the words of that great-saint Love-god and Indra also took flight. [1-64-15]"
1-64-15,"Owing to his angering that great-resplendent Vishvamitra is now divested of his ascetical merit, and he has no peace of mind owing to ungovernable senses. [1-64-16]"
1-64-16,"His conscience became sentimental owing to the divesture of his ascetical merit, and he soliloquised, &#39;I shall not succumb to wrath in anyway, nor I put my presentiment into words.&#39; [1-64-17]"
1-64-17,"Otherwise, I do not even respire for a hundred years for the respiratory gestures will also exhibit moods, and I indeed emaciate myself until I become a real conqueror of my own senses. [1-64-18]"
1-64-18,"&#39;Till such time as I acquire Brahman-hood with the merit of my own ascesis I will be breathless and foodless, even if it is going to take endless years, and while I am in ascesis my bodily organs indeed will not undergo any deterioration.&#39; So said Vishvamitra to himself. [1-64-19]"
1-64-19,"Thus that eminent sage abided by the commitment to the vow for a thousand years, oh, Rama, the legatee of Ragu, which is a nonpareil vow in the world. Thus Shataananda continued. [1-64-20]"
1-65-1,"That great-saint Vishvamitra then leaving off the snowbound Himalayas on north, oh, Rama, he reached eastern quarter and undertook rigorous ascesis. Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. [1-65-1]"
1-65-2,"Committing himself to a vow of muteness, oh, Rama, he performed an unexcelled and unmatched ascesis which is highly impracticable for others to perform. [1-65-2]"
1-65-3,"Even on completing a thousand years, even when that great-saint became woodenly, even many barriers are at full blast, oh, Rama, fury has not entered his heart of hearts, for he stood fast in an unmitigated ascesis on making a firm determination. [1-65-3, 4a]"
1-65-4,"On one day when those thousand years of ascesis with the rigorous pledge of Vishvamitra are being completed, and when he started to eat his meal, oh, Rama, best of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, Indra arrived there disguising himself as a Brahman and requested for the readily available meal. [1-65-4b, 5]"
1-65-5,"Then that godly Vishvamitra willingly gave away all the readied meal to that Brahman, and as no meal is leftover by Brahman-Indra, that great-ascetic Vishvamitra starved himself. Vishvamitra did not speak a little to the Brahman in dissent as he is abided by his pledge of muteness, and he again remained in muteness and breath-control. Like that, he indeed carried on his ascesis. [1-65-6, 7]"
1-65-6,"That eminent saint remained without respiration for another thousand years, and then fumes have started to emit from the head of sage who is controlling his breath, by which fumes the triad of worlds looked as if it is searing, and this startled all the worlds. [1-65-8, 9a]"
1-65-7,"Then the gods, sages, gandharva-s, serpents, reptiles, demons are puzzled at the ascesis of Vishvamitra, and as their own resplendence is dulled by the ascesis of Vishvamitra, thereby they are marred by this blemish of lowered resplendence, then all of them addressed the Grandparent, Brahma. [1-65-9b, 10]"
1-65-8,"Even if that great-saint Vishvamitra is angered and allured in order to foil his ascetical ascendancy, by all of us and by all means oh, god, he is transcending these lures, angers, and passions by his ascesis. [1-65-11]"
1-65-9,"Now, even an imperceptible imperfection does not really appear in him, but if his heartfelt desire is not meted out, he will devastate the triad of worlds with his ascetic power. [1-65-12, 13a]"
1-65-10,"All the directions are all tumultuous, all the oceans are tempestuous, and all the mountains are eruptive, and nothing is bright. [1-65-13b, 14a]"
1-65-11,"The earth is highly tremulous, air is gusting turbulently, oh, Brahma, people tend to become non-theistic and we do not know what to do. [1-65-14b, 15a]"
1-65-12,"All the beings in the triad of the worlds are very highly perturbed at their senses and they are as though stupefied, and when juxtaposed the sun is lustreless before the resplendence of that great sage. [1-65-15b, 16a]"
1-65-13,"Oh, God, great saint Vishvamitra turned out to be the embodiment of Fire-god, and before that great-resplendent and most reverential sage makes up his mind for total destruction of all worlds he is to be placated. [1-65-16b, 17a]"
1-65-14,"&#39;As to how the End-Time Fire entirely blazed away the triad of worlds previously, now this sage may do likewise, hence whatever is his predilection that may be given to him, even if he wants to become the potentate on the realm of gods.&#39; Thus, all gods appealed to Brahma [1-65-17b, 18a]"
1-65-15,"Then all the assemblages of gods keeping the Grandparent Brahma in their forefront appeared before that great souled Vishvamitra and said this harmonious word. [1-65-18b, 19a]"
1-65-16,"Oh, Brahma-sage, you are welcome. We are much contented with your ascesis. Oh, Kaushika, you have achieved Bahaman-hood by your rigorous ascesis. [1-65-19b, 20a]"
1-65-17,"&#39;Along with the assemblages of Marut-Wind-gods, I bestow upon you a long life. Let blissfulness betide you. You be safe. Oh, gentle sage, you may take leave as you please.&#39; Thus, Brahma said to Vishvamitra. [1-65-20b, 21a]"
1-65-18,"On hearing the word of Grandparent Brahma and the other residents of heaven, and on paying good devoirs to all of them that great saint cheerfully said. [1-65-21b, 22a]"
1-65-19,"If Brahman-hood and eternality have befallen on me, let the quintessence of AUM and vaSat syllables, and even all Veda-s patronise me. [1-65-22b, 23a]"
1-65-20,"&#39;Oh, gods, he who is the outstanding one among the geniuses of kingcraft, and among the scholars of Veda-s as well, even that Vashishta, the brainchild of Brahma, shall acknowledge me in this way as Brahma-sage. Oh, the best gods, you may take leave if you can effectuate this ultimate yearning of mine.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra requested the gods. [1-65-23b, 24]"
1-65-21,"Then the best one among meditators Vashishta has come over there when the gods besought him to come, and he made friendship with Vishvamitra. He also said in this way to Vishvamitra, &#39;you are a Brahma-sage.&#39; [1-65-25]"
1-65-22,"&#39;No doubt, you are a Brahma-sage and everything will accrue to you in accordance with the sublimity of this sageship,&#39; and when Vashishta said so to Vishvamitra, all the gods have gone away as they have come. [1-65-26]"
1-65-23,"On getting his Brahman-hood even the virtue-souled Vishvamitra started to reverence the supreme among meditators and his counterpart Brahma-sage, namely Vashishta. [1-65-27]"
1-65-24,"When his aim is effectuated Vishvamitra ambled all over the earth abiding in ascesis, and oh, Rama, this great souled sage Vishvamitra achieved Brahman-hood in this way. [1-65-28]"
1-65-25,"Oh, Rama, he is the best saint, he is the embodiment of ascesis, he is always obliged with righteousness, and he is the stronghold for fortitude. [1-65-29]"
1-65-26,"On narrating the legend of Vishvamitra in this way that best Brahman and great-resplendent Sage Shataananda took respite. And on listening the narration of Sage Shataananda said in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, king Janaka said this sentence to Kushika&#39;s son, Vishvamitra, with suppliantly adjoined palms. [1-65-30b, 31a]"
1-65-27,"Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, you happened to be here at this Vedic-ritual which is conducted by me, oh, Kaushika, that too, along with Rama and Lakshmana, the legatees of Kakutstha, thereby I am fortunate, I am much obliged. [31b, 32a]"
1-65-28,"Oh, Brahman, I stand consecrated just by your graceful glance, and oh, great saint, I reckon that I have achieved many boons just glancing at you. [1-65-32b, 33a]"
1-65-29,"Oh, great-resplendent Brahman, myself and the noble souled Rama have heard about your great ascesis when Sage Shataananda extolled it comprehensively. [1-65-33b, 34a]"
1-65-30,"The congregationalists available in this Vedic-ritual congregation have also heard about your numerous endowments. Inestimable is your ascesis, infinite is your power, and oh, son of Kushika, your talents are everlastingly invaluable. [1-65-34b, 35]"
1-65-31,"Oh, lord, there is no contentment to me while listening to your wondrous narratives, but oh nobleman, time for vespertine ritual is fast approaching as sun&#39;s sphere is dangling westward. [1-65-36]"
1-65-32,"Oh, great-resplendent sage, it will be apt of you to see me tomorrow. Oh, best meditator, it will be apt of you to permit me to leave for now. Thus Janaka sought leave from Vishvamitra. [1-65-37]"
1-65-33,"When he is spoken in that way, the best saint Vishvamitra is pleased at heart, and praising Janaka, who too is pleased to meet the sage, immediately bid farewell to the best one among men, namely Janaka. [1-65-38]"
1-65-34,"This way on saying to the best saint, the king of Mithila and the legatee of Videha lineage, immediately performed circumambulations along with his teachers and relatives to Vishvamitra in veneration. [1-65-39]"
1-65-35,"Even that virtue souled Vishvamitra started towards his own camp along with Rama and Lakshmana, while being venerated by great sages who are available in the ritual-hall. [1-65-40]"
1-66-1,"Then on performing morning time rites in the aurora of next morning, king Janaka invited great souled Vishvamitra, along with Raghava-s. [1-66-1]"
1-66-2,"On reverencing Vishvamitra and the noble souled Raghava-s according to the formalities envisaged by scriptures, then the virtue souled Janaka spoke these words, indeed. [1-66-2]"
1-66-3,"Oh, god, you are welcome, oh, holy sage, bid me as to what I should for you, for I am biddable by you, indeed... [1-66-3]"
1-66-4,"When said thus by the foreseer Janaka, [who can foresee as to why Vishvamitra came with Raghava-s this far, and thus asked him as to what next is to be done,] that sage Vishvamitra, for he is presager and wordsmith, [and who knows what is to be done next,] said these words in reply to that valiant king Janaka. [1-66-4]"
1-66-5,"These two are the sons of Dasharatha, well-renowned Kshatriya-s in world, and they are desirous to see that marvellous bow which has a place with you... [1-66-5]"
1-66-6,"You may show that bow, well bodes you, and on beholding that bow the desire of these two princes will come true, and they will go back as they like... [1-66-6]"
1-66-7,"But Janaka replied the great sage Vishvamitra when he was addressed thus, I shall [firstly] tell by which reason that bow has its place here... [1-66-7]"
1-66-8,"Oh, godly sage, there was a king renowned as Devaraata, sixth one from Nimi, [the originator of our lineage,] and this bow was handed down to him for custodial care by the Sublime Soul, Shiva... [1-66-8]"
1-66-9,"Once, during the devastation of the Vedic-ritual of Daksha Prajapati, the mettlesome god Rudra, rancorously outstretching the bowstring of this bow, said this to all gods, superciliously... [1-66-9]"
1-66-10,"&#39;Oh, gods, whereby you have not apportioned my portion [of oblations in Vedic-ritual s, as I am also the] desirer of such portion, [thereby] I will shred the highly revered heads of yours with this bow...&#39; [So said Shiva to gods.] [1-66-10]"
1-66-11,"Then, oh, best saint Vishvamitra, all gods are truly dismayed, and on their supplicating, Bhava, namely Shiva, the God of Gods is gladdened... [1-66-11]"
1-66-12,"And that Sublime Soul Shiva gladly gave that bow to all of the great souled gods, and oh, godly saint, then those great souled gods gave this gem of a bow of Shiva, the God of Gods, to our ancestor [Devaraata,] for custodial care... [1-66-12, 13a]"
1-66-13,"Later, when I was ploughing the ritual field then raised by the plough [from the furrow is a baby girl... since she is] gained while consecrating the ritual-field, she is named as Seetha, and thus she is renowned... [1-66-13b, 14a]"
1-66-14,"Hers is a non-uterine birth as she surfaced from the surface of the earth, but fostered as my own soul-born girl and I determined [to give her in marriage to a bridegroom where his] boldness is the only bounty, [I receive in that marriage...] [1-66-14b, 15a]"
1-66-15,"Oh, eminent sage, as my daughter has surfaced from the surface of earth and has come of age, the kings, [having heard my declaration that the bounty for Seetha is boldness alone,] have come and besought for her... [1-66-15b, 16a]"
1-66-16,"To all of those kings who are beseeching for the girl, I have not given my daughter, saying that she will be given for a bounty of boldness... [1-6-16b, 17a]"
1-66-17,"Then all the kings convoked and on arriving at Mithila, then they wanted to ascertain the calibre [of the bow, vis-a-vis their own...] [1-66-17b, 18a]"
1-66-18,"For them, those who wanted to ascertain the calibre of the bow, that bow of Shiva is fetched to their proximity, but they are incapable to joggle it, or even to catch hold of it... [1-66-18b, 19a]"
1-66-19,"Oh, great saint, on knowing the valour of those valorous ones as valueless, I countermanded them... oh, ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra, by that you may know [the sequel of it...] [1-66-19b, 20a]"
1-66-20,"Then, oh, eminent sage, those kings beleaguered Mithila in a blind fury, since a self-mistrust bechanced among them all, about their own valour... [1-66-20b, 21a]"
1-66-21,"They surmised for themselves that they are brushed off by me, and they possessed by a high rancour, they strangled the City of Mithila... [1-66-21b, 22a]"
1-66-22,"Then elapsed is an year and in anyway the possessions for livelihood went into a decline, oh, eminent sage, thereby I am highly anguished [1-66-22b, 23a]"
1-66-23,"Then I have assuaged the assemblages of gods by my ascesis and gods are also highly gladdened and gave me fourfold forces... [1-66-23b, 24a]"
1-66-24,"Then those evildoers and self-mistrustful kings while being drubbed [by the heaven-sent army, they have become] vigourless and broken, and they beat a hasty retreat... [1-66-24b, 25a]"
1-66-25,"Oh, tigerly sage this is that supremely radiant bow, and oh, saint of sacred vows, I will show it, even to Rama and Lakshmana... [1-66-25b, 26a]"
1-66-26,"If Rama strings the bowstring of that bow, oh, sage, I will offer my daughter, whose birth is non-uterine, to Dasharatha&#39;s Rama... [So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.] [1-66-26b, c]"
1-67-1," On listening to the words of Janaka, the eminent-saint Vishvamitra indeed said to  the king Janaka thus as, ""let the bow be displayed to Rama..."" [1-67-1]"
1-67-2," Then king Janaka indeed ordered his ministers, ""bring the divine bow which is  decorated with sandalwood paste and garlands... [1-67-2]"
1-67-3," Thus clearly instructed by Janaka those high souled ministers have gone out from  there and entered the palace-chambers, and they came out with an eight-wheeled coffer in which  the bow of Shiva is ensconced, and those ministers got it tugged by five thousand tall men of  illimitable energy who somehow tugged it very difficultly, and thus the ministers have re-entered  there keeping that bow afore of them. [1-67-3, 4]"
1-67-4," On fetching that iron coffer wherein that bow is there, those ministers of the  king have reported to their godlike King Janaka. [1-67-5]"
1-67-5," Oh king and sovereign of Mithila, here is the select bow that is reverenced by  all kings, oh, best king, which you wished to be evincible to the boys, to evince their  capabilities... [1-67-6]"
1-67-6," On listening the announcement of his ministers the king spoke to the noble souled  Vishvamitra and to both Rama and Lakshmana too duly making palm-fold. [1-67-7]"
1-67-7," Here is that exquisite bow, oh, Brahman, which is held as a time-honoured bow by  the lineage of Janaka kings, and with which even the highly forceful kings are rendered  inefficient to take aim with it, previously... [1-67-8]"
1-67-8," None in all the assemblages of gods, inclusive of demigods, demons, gandharva-s,  yaksha-s, kinnaraa-s, or reptilian demigods, is capable enough to take aim with this bow and all  are rendered incapable... and then, in brandishing this bow for a proper grip, or in bracing its  bowstring to the other end, or in twitching the bowstring for its tautness, or in placing the  arrow on bowstring at a proper place for a proper stretchability, or even in taking a good aim  with it... what will be that capability of one from among humans... [1-1-9, 10]"
1-67-9," ""Oh, eminent-saint, such as it is, this nonpareil bow among all bows is brought  in, and oh, highly fortunate sage Vishvamitra, let this be displayed to those two princes...""  Thus Janaka said to Vishvamitra. [1-67-11]"
1-67-10," Vishvamitra on listening the sentence of Janaka along with Rama, on his part said  to Raghava, ""oh, boy Rama... you may see the bow..."" [1-67-12]"
1-67-11," Upon the word of the great sage Vishvamitra, Rama on unclosing the lid of that  strongbox, wherein that bow is ensconced, saw the bow and said. [1-67-13]"
1-67-12," Now I wish to get the feel of this supreme bow, oh, Brahman, and I shall try to  brandish it, or even try to take aim with it... [1-67-14]"
1-67-13," ""All Right!"" said the saint and king to Rama in chorus, and Rama upon the word of  the sage grasping it at the middle handgrip playfully grabbed the bow. [1-67-15]"
1-67-14," While many thousands of men are witnessing that right-minded Rama the legatee of  Raghu stringed the bow effortlessly. [1-67-16]"
1-67-15," Further, that dextrous one has stringed that bow with bowstring and started to  stretch it up to his ear to examine its tautness, but that glorious one who is foremost among  men, Rama, broke that bow medially. [1-67-17]"
1-67-16," Then there bechanced an explosive explosion when the bow is broken, like the  explosiveness of down plunging thunder, and the earth is tremulously tremulous, as it happens  when a mountain is exploding. [1-67-18]"
1-67-17," Bewildered by that raucous caused by the breakage of bow, all the people swooned,  except for that eminent-saint Vishvamitra, king Janaka, and those two Raghava-s, namely Rama and  Lakshmana. [1-67-19]"
1-67-18," While the people are being reaccustomed after their undergoing the shock, at that  moment that sententious king Janaka, whose discomfiture has completely departed by now has said  this to the eminent-saint Vishvamitra with a reverent palm-fold. [1-67-20]"
1-67-19," Oh, godly sage, the gallantry of Dasharatha's Rama is evidently seen... and the  whys of this boy and wherefores of his stringing that massive bow are unimaginable to me! More  so, humans lifting it! How so? This is an unhoped-for incident for me, besides, breaking it! This  a is highly wondrous experience for me... [1-67-21]"
1-67-20," My daughter Seetha on getting Dasharatha's Rama as her husband, she will bring  celebrity to the lineage of Janaka-s... [1-67-22]"
1-67-21," Oh, Kaushika, my commitment that she is the bounty of bravery has also come  true... and my daughter Seetha who is nurtured well than my own lives is a worthy bride for  Rama... [1-67-23]"
1-67-22," Should you give consent, oh, Brahman, my ministers will be hastened to speedily  go to Ayodhya in chariots, oh, Kaushika, let safeness betide you, and one and all by this  matrimony... [1-67-24]"
1-67-23," With their observant submissions those ministers will narrate in detail about the  sincere endowment of Seetha as bravery's bounty to Rama, and they will lead king Dasharatha into  my city that observantly... [1-67-25]"
1-67-24," ""Those ministers will also tell the king Dasharatha that both the Kakutstha-s,  Rama and Lakshmana, are under the aegis of saint Vishvamitra, and thus gladdening that king they  will expeditiously usher in king Dasharatha for marriage..."" So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.  [1-67-26]"
1-67-25," Vishvamitra said, ""so be it,"" and then that right-minded king Janaka on consulting  with his ministers started to send his ministers, plenipotentiaries, to Ayodhya to inform  Dasharatha in detail as to what has happened, and likewise to bring him to Mithila. [1-67-27]"
1-68-1,"Those envoys who are clearly ordered by Janaka entered the city of Ayodhya on sojourning for three nights en route, and whose horses are overtired for they are galloped so fast to loose no time. [1-68-1]"
1-68-2,"On going to the palace those envoys are given an audience with the consent of Dasharatha, and when they are conducted into the palace-chambers they have seen the elderly king Dasharatha gleaming like a god. [1-68-2]"
1-68-3,"Completely gone is the angst of all the legates on seeing godly Dasharatha, and all of them adjoing palms in reverence said this compliant and mellowly worded sentence to the king. [1-68-3]"
1-68-4,"Oh, exalted emperor Dasharatha! Janaka, the lineal king of Janaka-s and the present sovereign of Mithila is asking time and time again with mellowly words instilled with friendliness, after the wellbeing and after the unmitigated prosperity of your highness, along with that of your highness&#39; priests and teachers, also that of your highness&#39; subjects, who always precede your highness in convoys in any event, as your highness are the one who ingratiates himself with the Ritual-fires, ever and anon... [1-68-4, 5]"
1-68-5,"His highness Janaka of Videha, and the sovereign of Mithila, having asked after your highness&#39; wellbeing is sensibly saying this word to your highness, with the indorse of Kaushika... [1-68-6]"
1-68-6,"Well-known is the solemn promise of mine that my daughter Seetha is a bounty for bravery... also well-know is that the kings who came to lift the bow turned out as gutless kings, and then they turned out as rancorous kings at me, and it is also well-known that I turned them back with my guts... [1-68-7]"
1-68-7,"Oh, Emperor Dasharatha, your young and valorous son who serendipitously arrived at Mithila along with his younger brother Lakshmana, keeping Vishvamitra at his fore, finally carries off this girl, the well-known daughter of mine... [1-68-8]"
1-68-8,"Also, oh, highly dextrous king Dasharatha, noble souled Rama wrecked that divine bow, which is a gem of a bow among bows, at its central point before a grand assembly of people... [1-68-9]"
1-68-9,"Seetha is the bounty for bravery and I shall have to afford her to the noble-souled Rama, as such it will be apt of you to give your consent as I wish to keep up my solemn promise... [1-68-10]"
1-68-10,"Keeping your royal priest Vashishta and other teachers ahead of you, oh, great emperor, I wish you to come apace, let safe betide you, for it will be apt of you to take a look at your ennobled son Rama, and Lakshmana, too... [1-68-11]"
1-68-11,"&#39;It will be apt of you to make my solemn promise maintainable, and that way you will derive delight on seeing both of your sons...&#39; [1-68-12]"
1-68-12,"Thus the sovereign of Videha kingdom said these endearing words, abiding by the counsel of Sage Shataananda, and Sage Vishvamitra is also consentient to the proposal... Thus the envoys conveyed the proposal and paused. [1-68-13]"
1-68-13,"King Dasharatha is highly gladdened on hearing that message from the delegates, and said this way to Vashishta, Vaamadeva, and to his other ministers, as well. [1-68-14]"
1-68-14,"This one Rama, the enhancer of Kausalya&#39;s rejoice, is stopping over at Videha kingdom along with his brother Lakshmana, and Vishvamitra is taking care of both these boys... [1-68-15]"
1-68-15,"On observing the valour of Kakutstha Rama, noble souled Janaka wishes to gift his daughter as bride to Raghava Rama... [1-68-16]"
1-68-16,"If you all favour the tidings from the noble-souled Janaka as to what has happened in Mithila, we quickly proceed to that city, let not the time lapse... Thus Dasharatha informed his counsel. [1-68-17]"
1-68-17,"The ministers along with all of the great sages said in consonance, Most Welcome... and then that highly pleased king Dasharatha said to the ministers, we travel tomorrow... [1-68-18]"
1-68-18,"The ministers of king Janaka who are gifted with all talents are given grateful hospitality by Dasharatha, and they all dwelt that night in Ayodhya, overjoyed at the successful completion of their august legatine, called <font color=""#B3003A"">sIta kalyANam... </font>[1-68-19]"
1-69-1,"On the next dawn that heartened king Dasharatha who is with his teachers and his relatives then said this to his minister Sumantra. [1-69-1]"
1-69-2,"Now let the chancellors of exchequers draw ample riches, gems and numerous other items that are used in the marriage from bridegroom&#39;s side, all-inclusively, and let them travel in advance and let them be well-prepared for any exigency... [1-69-2]"
1-69-3,"Let the quadruple forces start off in a trice from everywhere at my order, and others shall start with unexcelled vehicles like palanquins, sedan chairs, litters etc., and with those that can be yoked with horses, like cabined-coaches and horse-carriages... [1-69-3]"
1-69-4,"Vashishta, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali and Kaashyapa, and the long-lived Maarkandeya, and Sage Kaatyaayana... let these Brahmans travel in forefront... and let horses be yoked to my royal-cariole, and as the messengers of Janaka are hastening me arrange for the travel without time lapse... Thus Dasharatha ordered. [1-69-4, 5]"
1-69-5,"On the word of that best king the fourfold opulence, and even the fourfold forces up to some extent followed rearward of the king who is going after the sages who are going afore of him. [1-69-6]"
1-69-6,"Travelling on a four-day-route Dasharatha reached the fringes of Videha kingdom, and on hearing this, the illustrious king Janaka arranged for welcome ceremonies at the outskirts of the city. [1-69-7]"
1-69-7,"Then the king Janaka who is by far gladdened went into a state of ecstatic elation when he met the senescent king and paladin of people, namely Dasharatha, as the pace for the marriage celebrations is quickened because of the immediate arrival of Dasharatha. [1-69-8]"
1-69-8,"And the best one among men, king Janaka, gleefully said this commendable sentence to Dasharatha, the best legatee of Raghu, oh, king, a hearty welcome to you. Oh, legatee of Raghu, your arrival to my city is just by my providence... you will now get delectation on seeing your sons who won accolades just by their valorousness in the act of raising and breaking Shiva&#39;s bow... [1-69-9, 10a]"
1-69-9,"Providentially bechanced is the arrival of this great-resplendent and godly sage Vashishta, who arrived here with all of these eminent Brahmans, like Indra himself with all gods... [1-69-10b, 11a]"
1-69-10,"Providentially my hindrances are overcome by the arrival of godlike sages, and providentially my lineage too is gloried owing to this hymeneal engagement with noble-souled Raghava-s, who are the most valorous among all the valorous people... [1-69-11b, 12a]"
1-69-11,"Because you are born in first and foremost Ikshvaku dynasty, hence you are the Indra of Indra-like kings on earth... and hence, it will be apt of you to initiate the celebrations of marriage tomorrow, and the marriage itself after the culmination of the Vedic-ritual in three or four days, and the date and time for the marriage, that which is agreeable to the best sages can be decided, and you can get it performed on that date, through those great sages... [1-69-12b, 13a]"
1-69-12,"On hearing that sentence of king Janaka the sententious king Dasharatha replied the king Janaka from amongst the sages. [1-69-13b, 14a]"
1-69-13,"Recipiency rests with the restitutor... so I have heard earlier. Hence, whatever you say, for you are the knower of probity and nothing goes amiss in your astute thinking, that we will do... [1-69-14b, 15a]"
1-69-14,"On listening that sentence of that affirmer of principles, namely Dasharatha, that which is conformable to the principles of marriages and familial glory, a thrill of joy came over the king of Videha. [1-69-15b. 16a]"
1-69-15,"Then, on the foregathering of sages from Vashishta&#39;s side with the sages of Mithila all the sages have attained extreme joy and they spent that night happily. [1-69-16b, 17a]"
1-69-16,"Then that most brilliant Rama, keeping Vishvamitra ahead, and strutting in step with Lakshmana, strutted to touch the feet of his father Dasharatha. [1-69-17]"
1-69-17,"On seeing his two sons, the super medallists in Raghu&#39;s dynasty, King Dasharatha is highly rejoiced and he resided in Mithila with a high contentment, for the reverence of Janaka is that high. [1-69-18]"
1-69-18,"Even the great-resplendent Janaka on performing ritual acts according to scriptures for the Vedic-ritual on hand, and the preparatory rituals for handing out both of his daughters in marriage, went into the sleep of the just, with his palm on his chest. [1-69-19]"
1-70-1,"Then on the next day morning after getting the ritual liturgies performed through sages, he that articulator Janaka articulated this to sage Shataananda, the royal priest. [1-70-1]"
1-70-2,"My younger brother renowned thus as Kushadhvaja, a highly self-righteous one and a highly brilliant one is ruling from the auspicious and holy city named Saankaasya, which city is surrounded by River Ikshumati as a natural moat, in which moat bastions of tridents are staked all around... and my brother presides over that city as if he is sitting in the Pushpaka aircraft of richly-rich god Kubera, and as though supping the sugarcane juice-like waters of River Ikshumati... [1-70-2, 3]"
1-70-3,"And I wish to see him, as he is the nominated benefactor of this Vedic-ritual of mine, and he too shall become a rejoicer in partaking the joyousness of this marriage...  So said Janaka to Shataananda. [1-70-4]"
1-70-4,"That way when Janaka asseverated that enunciation in the presence of Shataananda, Shataananda in turn ordered and summoned envoys, and then some alacritous envoys have come, whom Janaka ordered to proceed to his brother. [1-70-5]"
1-70-5,"By the order of the king those envoys who have speedy horses have travelled on to city Saankaasya speedily, to lead forth that tigerly man Kushadhvaja that speedily, which is as good as fetching Vishnu by order of Indra. [1-70-6]"
1-70-6,"On arriving in city Saankaasya those envoys have seen king Kushadhvaja and on submitting what has happened to the king about Rama&#39;s breaking of Shiva&#39;s bow, and they have also submitted the point of view of Janaka regarding marriages of four daughters. [1-70-7]"
1-70-7,"On hearing that event from the worthy envoys whose speed is praiseworthy, king Kushadhvaja came right away to Mithila by the order of king Janaka. [1-70-8]"
1-70-8,"Kushadhvaja addressed himself to the insightful one and a compassionate person in the duty of an elder brother, namely Janaka, and on reverencing sage Shataananda firstly, next he has reverenced his fondly affectionate brother Janaka, and then he sat upon a majestic seat, that which is befitting to kings. [1-70-9, 10a]"
1-70-9,"Both the brothers of unlimited self-refulgence having assumed their high seats, they who are distinguished for their righteous acts have started to send Sudaamana, the distinguished minister. [1-70-10b, 11a]"
1-70-10,"Oh, minister plenipotentiary, Sudaamana, you please proceed immediately to king Dasharatha, the legatee of Ikshvaku-s with illimitable resplendence, and let that invincible king Dasharatha be led hither along with his sons and along with his Vedic-celebrants... Thus Janaka ordered Sudaamana, the minister. [1-70-11b, 12a]"
1-70-11,"Accordingly Sudaamana has gone to the visitatorial-palace of the promoter of Raghu&#39;s heritage, namely Dasharatha, and he said this on appearing before that king duly bowing down and hailing the king. [1-70-12b, 13a]"
1-70-12,"Oh, valiant king, oh, sovereign of Ayodhya, his highness the sovereign of Mithila from the heritage of Videha kings is poised for seeking an audience with your highness, along with your highness&#39; royal-priest Vashishta and other mentors... The minister Sudaamana said so to Dasharatha. [1-70-13b, 14a]"
1-70-13,"On hearing that best minister&#39;s words, then king Dasharatha came to the place where Janaka is available, along with his kinsmen and the assemblages of sages. [1-70-14b, 15a]"
1-70-14,"That sententious king Dasharatha said this to the king from the lineage of Videha kings, Janaka, who is with his mentors, kinsfolk, and ministers. [1-70-15b, 16a]"
1-70-15,"Oh, exalted king Janaka, you already appreciate that this godly sage Vashishta is godlike to the bloodline of Ikshvaku-s, and in all affairs he is our internuncio... [1-70-16b, 17a]"
1-70-16,"Should an assent be given by Sage Vishvamitra, along with all the great sages present here, this equanimous Vashishta will narrate about my bloodline, lineally... And, to the nod of Vishvamitra Dasharatha become reticent, and then the godly and sententious sage Vashishta who is along with his men of the cloth said these sentences to the king of Videha, namely Janaka. [1-70-17b, 18, 19a]"
1-70-17,"The Unprovable emanated the timeless, changeless and perishless Brahma, and from that Being, namely Brahma, Mariichi is begotten, and Kaashyapa is the son of Mariichi, and the Sun is begotten from Kaashyapa, and Manu is said to be the son of the Sun... [1-70-19b, 20]"
1-70-18,"Manu is the earliest Prajaapati and Ikshvaaku is the son of Manu, and that Ikshvaaku is the first king of Ayodhya... know thus... [1-70-21]"
1-70-19,"The son of Ikshvaaku is the legendary Kukshi, thus he is renowned, and the famous Vikukshi is the son of Kukshi... [1-70-22]"
1-70-20,"From that most brilliant and courageous Vikukshi, Baana emerged as son, and the highly refulgent and valinat Anaranya is the son of Baana... [1-70-23]"
1-70-21,"Pruthu is the son of Anaranya, and Trishanku is Pruthu&#39;s son, and the highly renowned Dhundumaara happened to be the son of Trishanku... [1-70-24]"
1-70-22,"Dhundumaara begot a highly glorious and a speediest charioteer Yuvanaashva as son, and Mandhaata emerged as the son of Yuvanaashva... [1-70-25]"
1-70-23,"Maandhaata engendered the highly noble Susandhi as son, and even Susandhi engendered two sons, namely Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit... [1-70-26]"
1-70-24,"From Dhruvasandhi, an illustrious one named as Bharata is begotten, and Bharata begot a highly effulgent son named as Asita... [1-70-27]"
1-70-25,"To which Asita, kings like Haihaya-s, Taalajanghaa-s, and the valiant Shashabindu-s have become adversaries and kings in hostility, he had to wage war with them... [1-70-28]"
1-70-26,"While counterattacking those kings, Asita is dethroned in war and then he reached Himalayas along with his two wives... [1-70-29]"
1-70-27,"Asita was with his meagre forces when he was in Himalayas, and there he drew nigh of his Time. At the time of his demise two of his wives were pregnant, and one of two wives gave toxic food to the co-wife for abortion... thus we heard... [1-70-30-31a]"
1-70-28,"There was a saint named Cyavana, the heir of Sage Bhrigu, who in fascination with best and beautiful mountains then taking shelter on Himalayas. [1-70-31b, 32a]"
1-70-29,"One of the two wives of Asita, the lotus-petal eyed and highly fortunate one queen came there desirous of a best son, and reverenced the sage who is godly in his glow... [1-70-32b-33a]"
1-70-30,"Another queen Kaalindi who administer food poison to her co-wife has also come to the sage, and she too reverenced him. That sage spoke to her who received poison from her co-wife regarding the birth of her son. [1-70-34]"
1-70-31,"&#39;Oh, highly fortunate lady, a very good son and a very mighty son is there in your womb. Soon you will give birth to a highly vigorous, highly refulgent son and that illustrious one will take birth with toxicity, but there is no need to worry...&#39; So said Sage Cyavana to the queen of Asita who received the poison. [1-70-35]"
1-70-32,"On reverencing Sage Cyavana that husband devout princess whose husband is no more that lady gave birth to a son... [1-70-36]"
1-70-33,"Because he took birth along with the poison administered to his mother by her co-wife, he became Sagara, the emperor... [1-70-37]"
1-70-34,"From Sagara it is Asamanja and from Asamanja it is Amshuman, and from Amshuman it is Diliipa, and the son of Diliipa is Bhageeratha... [1-70-38]"
1-70-35,"From Bhageeratha it is Kakutstha, from Kakutstha it is Raghu, and Raghu&#39;s son is the great resplendent Pravriddha, who is reduced to a human flesh eater, and he is also known as Kalmaashapaada... and from him, that Pravriddha, Shankana is born... [1-70-39, 40a]"
1-70-36,"Shankana&#39;s son is Sudarshana, and from Sudarshana it is Agnivarsna... And Shiigraga is the son of Agnivarsna, and Shiighraga&#39;s son is Maru and from Maru it is Prashushruka, and Ambariisha is the son of Prashushruka... [1-70-41]"

1-70-38,"Aja was Naabhaaga&#39;s son and from Aja, this Dasharatha is manifest, and from him, from this Dasharatha, these brothers, Rama and Lakshmana are born... [1-70-43]"
1-70-39,"Oh, best one among men, Janaka, from the beginning this bloodline of Ikshvaaku-s is spotlessly immaculate, immensely impeccable, indomitable, and irreproachable, and in respect of these kings born in this line of blood, oh, king Janaka, I espouse that it will be meetly of you to offer your seemly daughters to this seemly pair of Rama and Lakshmana... So said Vashishta to king Janaka. [1-70-44, 45]"
1-71-1,"When sage Vashishta said that way, Janaka reverentially made palm fold and said this in reply, oh, sage, let safeness betide you all... now, it will be apt of you all to listen to our distinguished lineage... [1-71-1]"
1-71-2,"Oh, eminent sage Vashishta, he who is born in a particular noble gens has to inform about his parentage in its entirety, especially when he offers a bride... thereby oh, great sage, let all be informed of about our lineage... [1-71-2]"
1-71-3,"Once there was an emperor Nimi, who was renowned in the triad of worlds by his own accomplishments, and who was uniquely seraphic-souled and a best one among all stalwart emperors... [1-71-3]"

1-71-15,"On the departure of our aged father to heaven, I am looking after this godlike Kushadhvaja with brotherliness and lugging around the burden of this kingship... [1-71-15]"
1-71-16,"Then after sometime, a valorous king named Sudhanva came beleaguering Mithila, from his city Saamkaasha... [1-71-16]"
1-71-17,"&#39;The unexcelled bow of Shiva shall be given to me, along with the lotus-eyed virgin, Seetha...&#39; thus he started to urge me... [1-71-17]"
1-71-18,"Oh, Brahma sage Vashishta, for the reason of my non-bestowal of bow or bride he warred with me, and when he affronted me in that war I have put that Sudhanva to the sword... [1-71-18]"
1-71-19,"Oh, best sage Vashishta, on eliminating king Sudhanva, I have anointed my valiant brother Kushadhvaja in the kingdom of Saamkaasha... [1-71-19]"
1-71-20,"Oh, best saint Vashishta, this is that younger brother of mine, and I am the elder. Oh, eminent-saint, I am bestowing those brides with a highly gladdened heart... Seetha for Rama, and Urmila for Lakshmana, let there be felicity for all... [1-71-20, 21a]"
1-71-21,"My daughter Seetha is the bounty for bravery and in simile she is the daughter of the divine Providence, and thus the second one Urmila too... oh, eminent-saint, with a highly gladdened heart I reiterate thrice while I bestow those brides, there is no doubt about it... [1-71-21b, 22a]"
1-71-22,"Oh, king Dasharatha, let the preceding ritual of <font color=""#B3003A"">samaavartana</font>, be undertaken, and let manes be propitiated by the ritual, <font color=""#B3003A"">naandi-shraadha</font>, and afterwards you make happen the wedding celebrations ... thus, all will be blest...

[1-71-24]"
1-72-1,"Then the eminent-saint Vishvamitra together with Vashishta said these words to Janaka, the valiant king of Videha, who has just said about his lineage. [1-72-1]"
1-72-2,"The Ikshvaku-s and Videha-s are unimaginably admirable and immeasurably distinguished dynasties, oh, Janaka, the best one among all men, there is no single king comparable to one from these dynasties... [1-72-2]"
1-72-3,"Oh, king Janaka, these espousals of Seetha with Rama and Urmila with Lakshmana is behovely to each other&#39;s dynastical prestige and even it is befitting to the winsome charms of the brides and bridegrooms, but that being so... [1-72-3]"
1-72-4,"Oh, grand sire, you may listen to my words of advise... this younger brother of yours, king Kushadhvaja, is at home in every kind of probity... [1-72-4]"
1-72-5,"Oh, king, the pair of daughters of this right-minded Kushadhvaja is nonpareil in comeliness in this world, hence, oh, grand sire, we choose to pair them off with Bharata and Shatrughna... [1-72-5]"
1-72-6,"Oh, king, for the sake of those two honourable boys, for that young man Bharata and for that smart man Shatrughna, we opt your brother&#39;s daughters... [1-72-6]"
1-72-7,"All these four sons of Dasharatha have handsomeness and youthfulness, and they are equal to the four rulers of the world from four quarters, and their valour vies with the valour of God Vishnu... [1-72-7]"
1-72-8,"Oh, best king, let both these dynasties of yours, the impeccable dynasty of Ikshvaku-s and the immaculate dynasty of yours as well, be interlocked by these wedlock-s... Thus Vishvamitra advised Janaka. [1-72-8]"
1-72-9,"On hearing the words of Vishvamitra that have the concurrence of Vashishta then Janaka reverently said this to those two eminent-saints. [1-72-9]"
1-72-10,"By which reason you two eminent-saints personally bid fair to this befitting proposal, thereby I opine that my dynasty is highly honoured... [1-72-10]"
1-72-11,"So be it! Safe betides you all! Let the pair of Kushdhvaja&#39;s daughters, namely Maandavi, Shrutakiirti, devout themselves as a pair of wives to the paired brothers, namely Bharata and Shatrughna, respectively... [1-72-11]"
1-72-12,"Oh, eminent-saint Vishvamitra, let the palms of four princesses be taken in the palms of these four mettlesome princes in marriage, in the light of one day... [1-72-12]"
1-72-13,"Oh, Brahman, the savants acclaim that part of the day as the best for wedding ceremonies when both of the pre-Phalguni and post-Phalguni stars are available, and on such a time where post-Phalguni is ruling, for which Bhaga is the presiding deity for progeny... So said Janaka to the marriage party. [1-72-13]"
1-72-14,"On saying those gracious words thus, king Janaka got up from his throne and coming nigh of both of the eminent-saints, Vishvamitra and Vashishta, reverently said this sentence. [1-72-14]"
1-72-15,"You two, oh, eminent-saints, have done an excellent generous act in my respect, thus I will ever remain your proselyte... you may please preside over these thrones, that of mine, my brother&#39;s, and that of Dasharatha... [1-72-15]"
1-72-16,"As to how this city Mithila appertains to Dasharatha, in the same way city of Ayodhya is mine... and there shall be no hesitancy for you two sages in governance on these three kingdoms, thus it will be apt of you to make the marriages happen as aptly as you can... So said Janaka to the sages. [1-72-16]"
1-72-17,"The legatee of Raghu-s king Dasharatha is gladdened while the legatee of Videha is talking in such a hobnobbing way, and he replied king Janaka in this way. [1-72-17]"
1-72-18,"Oh, kings of Mithila, Janaka and Kushadhvaja, you two brothers have reverenced inestimable sages and coteries of kings, as such inestimable good manners are treasured in both of you... [1-72-18]"
1-72-19,"Enjoy that blessedness! Let safe betide you! We now depart to our visitatorial-palace, and we shall customarily carry out the tributary rituals... Dasharatha said thus. [1-72-19]"
1-72-20,"On seeking leave of absence from the sovereign of people, Janaka, that highly renowned king Dasharatha promptly departed from there, keeping both of the eminent-saints afore, namely Vishvamitra and Vashishta. [1-72-20]"
1-72-21,"King Dasharatha on going to his visitatorial-palace has procedurally undertaken the tributary rituals, and on getting up in the next morning, he carried out the initiatory rituals of marriages, in a grand way, in which donation of cows is a part. [1-72-21]"
1-72-22,"That lord of people king Dasharatha has righteously donated hundred thousand cows to Brahman-s, in the name of each of his four sons. [1-72-22]"
1-72-23,"In that cow donation ceremony intended for his sons, he that best one among men and the one who is affectionate towards his sons, Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, has donated on behalf of each of his sons, four hundred thousand cows, that are abundant milkers, and that have golden casings on their horns, and that are with their calves, and along with milking jugs made with bell metal, and he even donated very many other kinds of assets to Brahmans. [1-72-23, 24]"
1-72-24,"On performing the cow donations and <font color=""#B3003A"">samaavartana, snaataka</font>, the initiatory ceremonies of his sons, as well, he that serene king Dasharatha who is amidst the quartet of his sons, shone forth like serene Brahma, who is quartet-faced, with the quartet of Veda-s, and who is the overlord of mankind, amidst the quartet of presiding deities in the quartet of the world. [1-72-25]"
1-73-1,"We need not wait for any invitation or wedding card or call for this marriage, as all are welcome, equally and individually. Let us go there straight, without any introductions and preliminaries."
1-73-2,"On which day the king Dasharatha made the impressive cow donations or, initiatory rites, on that day alone the valiant Yudhaajit turned up. [1-73-1]"
1-73-3,"Yudhaajit, the son of Kekaya king and the brother of Kaikeyi, thus the direct maternal uncle of Bharata, having seen and asked after the wellbeing of Dasharatha said this to him. [1-73-2]"
1-73-4,"The ruler and king of Kekaya, viz., my father and your father-in-law, has affectionately asked after the wellbeing of all, and in whose wellbeing you are interested at my place, they are all hale and healthy as of now... [1-73-3]"
1-73-5,"Oh, Raghu&#39;s legatee, oh, best king, my father and the king of Kekaya is interested to see my sister Kaikeyi&#39;s son, Bharata, and for that reason I am sent to Ayodhya... [1-73-4]"
1-73-6,"Oh, lord of the land, in Ayodhya I have heard that you went to Mithila along with your sons for their marriages, and wishing to see my sister&#39;s son Bharata I promptly travelled here... Thus Yudhaajit told Dasharatha. [1-73-5, 6a]"
1-73-7,"Then king Dasharatha on seeing the adorable guest who arrived in his presence, and who is a merited one for adoration, Dasharatha adored Yudhaajit well, with full observances. [1-73-6b, 7a]"
1-73-8,"Then on taking rest for that night along with his noble-minded sons, and again on getting up in the next morning, and on performing morning-observances as a duty-bound king, Dasharatha arrived at the hall of Vedic-ritual, keeping the sages in his forefront. [1-73-7b-8]"
1-73-9,"Rama arrived at his father together with all of his brothers, keeping sage Vashishta and other eminent-saint ahead of them, on an opportune and appropriate hour called &#39;Victory...&#39; and all the bridegrooms are adorned with all kinds of jewellery appropriate for the wedding time, and all have performed the auspicious ceremony for marriage-thread, conducted prior to the marriage and, all have thread-bands tied around their wrists, as they all have performed an auspicious ceremony antecedent to marriage ceremony. [1-73-9, 10a]"
1-73-10,"Then that godly sage Vashishta on going from Vedic-ritual hall to marriage hall said this to Janaka, Oh, best one among best people, oh, king Janaka, having performed the auspicious marriage-thread ceremony, Dasharatha along with his sons is looking forward for the donor... [1-73-10b, 11]"
1-73-11,"In marriages all the <font color=""#B3003A"">puruSaartha-s</font> , the component values of life, namely rightness, riches, revelries, and results of final release will be occurring only if the benefactor and beneficiary meet, isn&#39;t it. Hence let king Dasharatha come, and then on actualising this best marriage you too will be doing your best devoir as royal priest... [1-73-12]"
1-73-12,"Janaka is not just a decidedly valiant king but he is the profound knower of probity also, besides being an unreservedly generous king, hence he has already made all arrangements, and when he is spoken in this way by Vashishta that king replied this sentence to that right honourable Vashishta. [1-73-13]"
1-73-13,"Who is that doorman that prevents your entry? Or, for whose orders you all await with a bated breath? Do you hesitate in your own house, or what? This kingdom is as good as yours... isn&#39;t so... [1-73-14]"
1-73-14,"Oh, eminent-saint Vashishta, on absolutely performing the auspicious ceremony for the marriage-thread, and thereby tying thread-band at wrists my daughters have already arrived, and they are at the base of the Altar of Fire, like the irradiant jets of flames of radiant fire... [1-73-15]"
1-73-15,"I am already ready and awaiting for you remaining at this Altar of Fire. Let everything be done indeed without any deterrents. What for the king Dasharatha is dawdling... So said Janaka to Vashishta. [1-73-16]"
1-73-16,"On hearing that sentence of Janaka, then Dasharatha started towards marriage hall, and then he started to enter his sons one by one, four in all, into marriage hall along with all of the assemblages of sages. [1-73-17]"
1-73-17,"Then that king from Videha bloodline, Janaka, said in this way to Vashishta, Oh, the knower of punctilios, oh, Brahma-sage, oh, masterly sage, along with other sages you make happen all of the marriage ceremonies of Rama, the rejoicer of the world... Thus Janaka spoke to Vashishta. [1-73-18, 19a]"
1-73-18,"Thus said, that godly sage Vashishta on saying, so be it, to Janaka, embarked on arranging Altar of Fire keeping sage Vishvamitra and the virtuous sage Shataananda afore of him, and that sage with great ascesis, Vashishta, has arranged an Altar of Fire in the midpoint of the cool-thatched manorial-marriage-shed, decorating it with sandal paste and flowers. Then he promptly sanctified variously coloured handy vessels, and lid-like concave earthen vessels, which are full with just sprouted sprigs, and he sanctified even other golden vessels, censers with fumes of incenses, conch-shell like vessels, and short handled wooden scoops for scooping oblatory items from vessels for putting it in long-handled scoops, and long-handled wooden scoops to drop those oblatory items into Ritual-fire, and vessels filled with oblatory items like ghee, water, milk etc., and vessels filled with toasted rice-flakes and vessels filled with holy yellow-rice duly treated with turmeric, and he sanctified all articles of wedding ceremony by sprinkling holy-yellow-rice, as a kind of dry-ablution. [1-73-19b, 20, 21, 22, 23a]"
1-73-19,"Then that great resplendent and eminent-saint Vashishta neatly overlaid even-sized sacred grass on that Altar of Fire synchronising with Vedic-chants, and on preparing Ritual-fire by rubbing two wooden sticks, called <font color=""#B3003A"">araNi</font> , he placed that fire in the pit of Altar, which is aflame now, and then reverently and in tune with the Vedic-hymns he effused oblational liquids into that Altar of Fire, with short-handled and long-handled wooden scoops. [1-73-23b, 24]"
1-73-20,"Then that king Janaka led forth Seetha, who by now is decorated with every variety of bridal jewellery, and on positioning her en face Raghava in the presence of Altar of Fire, then Janaka addressed Rama who is the enhancer of his mother Kausalya&#39;s rejoice. [1-73-25, 26a]"
1-73-21,"This is Seetha, my daughter, she acquits herself in whatever duty you undertake. Take her wishfully, let safeness betide you, take her palm into your palm... [1-73-26b, 27a]"
1-73-22,"Here Sita stands, my daughter fair, / The duties of thy life to share. / Take from her father, take thy bride, / Join hand to hand, and bliss betide! / - Ralph T. H. Griffith"
1-73-23,"The above is very a convenient and readymade gist of that verse. But the three pronouns in the first stanza <em>iyam, mama, tava</em> &#39;this, mine, yours&#39; are supposed to play havoc in deciphering the latent meaning of this verse. Let us look at some of them."
1-73-24,"Seetha is very much there in the front of Rama, and Janaka might have shown her and told take her...&#39; Why this <em>iyam</em> i.e., this It is explained as below:"
1-73-25,"Janaka: This and this alone is Seetha, the unique, exceptional and earmarked one for you... do not confuse yourself by looking at Urmila, Maandavi and Shrutakiirti they are for your brothers"
1-73-26,"Rama: Why she alone is earmarked for me?"
1-73-27,"Janaka: Because she is &#39;Seetha &#39;"
1-73-28,"Rama: What, you mean a furrow, or a sillion..."
1-73-29,"[Sillion is an old word for furrow, not found in dictionaries, but used by poet Hopkins in his &#39;The Windhover&#39; sheer plod makes plough down sillion /]"
1-73-30,"Janaka: Yes, everything comes out of earth... from coal to gold, flora to fauna, rivers to ridges everything.... a morsel of food comes from a handful of mud in this mortal world.... your being, becoming and belonging in, are manifest only because of that earth and earth enables you to live on her without seeking any requital or reciprocation and earth is the symbol of enduing toleration, though you dig, dung or dredge it.... hence, Seetha is the symbol for mortal truth, and mortally tolerant womanhood and you people want to know the Unknown in the skies, but do not wish to know what that is right under your feet... <em>vedaaham etam puruSham mahaantam aadityavarNam tamasaH parastaat |</em> if the Supreme Person beyond darkness is knowable, and sages like Vishvamitra know you and tell that you are some Super Soul <em>aham vedmi mahaatmaanam raamam satyaparaakramam - bala 19-14</em> likewise you shall know <em>iyam siitaa,</em> for she is somebody to match you... have you not mugged up Veda-s, Upanishad-s"
1-73-31,"Rama: Why not every bit of it... you name, it I tell it"
1-73-32,"Janaka: How does the fifth mantra of eighth topic in Chaandogya Upanishad reads?"
1-73-33,"<u>Adi Shankara&#39;s commentary</u>: There are three letters that denote the Absolute <em>sa, ta, yam</em>; and the syllable<em>ii</em> on <em>sat</em> is for easy pronunciation. The letter <em>sa</em> indicates immortality and the word <em>ta</em> mortality, and the syllable <em>yam</em> conditions and bridges both the above &#39; <u>Ramanuja comment:</u> The letter <em>sat</em> is immortality and the letter <em>ti</em> is mortality and <em>yam</em> conditions both, hence <em>sattiyam</em> is indicative of Spiritedness and non-spiritedness &#39; <u>Madhvaacaarya</u> says: <em>sat</em>, delivered immortal souls;<em>ti</em> yet to be delivered bounded souls; <em>yam</em> both the delivered and bounded souls."
1-73-34,"Janaka: Seetha is that <em>yam</em> the conjunctive, conditioner, bridge between the mortal and immortal, <em>setu - eSa setu iti vidhaaraNaa</em> the presiding deity of <em>cetana-acetana</em> dynamic, static beings. oh, Rama, it is said in Vishnu Puraana that Seetha is your lookalike, minus your sky-blue complexion, <em>raaghavatve bhavet siitaa...</em> It is said in yet another scripture, <em>yathaa mayaa jagat vyaaptam - svaruupeNa svabhaavataH | tayaa vyaaptam idam vishvam niyantrii ca tathaa iishvarii ||</em> &#39;as to how I am all pervading, likewise She, Goddess Lakshmi, is all pervading and the controller of the universe &#39; and if you want to establish yourself as the protector of this world, you have to take this and this Seetha alone, as she is the cause for the desired effect of yours and, she is from Mother Earth <em>ratna-garbhaa</em> and you are a sapphirine boy from a mother, and a sapphire shines only if it is studded in earth-given gold <em>anargham api maaNikyam hemaashrayam apekShate</em> otherwise you, your incarnation, your epic, your mission, why one or two, everything concerning you will be futile, and you have to return to your milky abode empty handed, and here on earth, every house breeds one or more Ravana-s"
1-73-35,"Rama: How am I to conclude &#39;this&#39; as &#39;that...&#39; I mean Goddess Lakshmi"
1-73-36,"Janaka: Certain aspects are to be inferred because they are unmanifest. Fire on the mountain is unmanifest but smoke is manifest, hence fire is inferred. So also, <em>ayam iishvarii</em> is manifest as <em>iyam</em> this girl... from <em>siitaa</em> furrow, sillion, a narrow trench in ground made by ploughshare... as a small seed manifests into a gigantic banyan tree, and from this the nature of her non-foetal birth, it is to be inferred likewise, and only because of it she is someone above mortals. Because you have come as a mortal she has to take birth as a mortal, as an inseparable entity of yours"
1-73-37,"Rama: Then why can&#39;t she fall from sky or from other planet?"
1-73-38,"Janaka: She cannot. Your connection with this earth is age-old and you love it. Because you love earth, she has to emerge from earth, a lovely act for you."
1-73-39,"Rama: Then why <em>mama sutaa...</em> she can be fostered in any orphanage"
1-73-40,"Janaka: Not so. An auspicious thing or being requires a sanctum sanctorum... Mithila is one such... and Videha-s are not just kings of this part of land, but they are priests of pious or holy things like the bow of Shiva. You know the naming of <em>vi-deha...</em> it is not &#39;without bodies...&#39; but transcending bodily affairs Thus she chose this as her background and as she presented herself to me as baby girl, I have look upon her as <em>mama sutaa</em> &#39;my daughter &#39; And many, many kings sought her hand in marriage, but I refused and they warred with me, whereby I had to call for the forces of gods to counterattack the enemy forces; perhaps, you might not have heard that humans can summon gods; thus gods are at my disposal; a prayer of mine brings them here, either for a war or for a ritual So, do not take me or my daughter Seetha, <em>iyam siitaa mama sutaa</em> as some ignoramus and insignificant dullards"
1-73-41,"Rama: Then why you want me to take back, as though she belonged to me for eons, but lost in a journey"
1-73-42,"Janaka: Yes, she is yours from ages unknown; I cannot donate her in <em>kanyaa-daana</em> &#39;bestowal of bride &#39; because your marriage is eternal. But you two have arrived here in human forms, so conduct yourselves in conformity with human customs.... that is why I tell <em>pratiicCha enaaam</em> &#39; take her back, wishfully &#39; for that saying of mine get no anger on me;<em>bhadram te</em> &#39;let safeness betide&#39; you; by this act of yours <em>paaNim gR^ihNiSva paaNinaa</em> &#39; you take her palm into your palm &#39; that which is customary in human <em>paaNigrahaNa-mahotsava</em> &#39;wedding ceremony &#39;; by the way, you always keep your consort in your heart <em>hR^idaya kamala</em> do not do such things as long as you are on earth for your incarnation will be disclosed.... just take her hand and let not this heavenly discourse be leaked out... lest Ravana may come to know that you are not human and it will be impossible for you to eliminate that evil, thereby"
1-73-43,"And we now proceed to the human level import of this verse."
1-73-44,"Janaka: &#39;<em>iyam</em> this girl who has --- <em>mugdhamanoharamanoj"
1-73-45,"so, <em>iyam</em> this one is about whom you have heard from day one in the hermitage of Siddha, i.e., when you started towards Mithila;"
1-73-46,"hence, <em>iyam</em> this one alone is that girl who is on your psyche from the minute you broke that Shiva&#39;s bow, and whom you are envisioning <em>praasaade praade ca pathi pathi ca saa pR^iShTataH saa purataH</em> &#39;on verandas of multistoried buildings and in window ledges, on this street and that street, before you, behind you &#39; during these days of your stay in Mithila...."
1-73-47,"Rama: No, No, No, you are wrong... I did not aim at any girl when aiming to lift that old bow... sorry for your unilateral conclusion..."
1-73-48,"Janaka: No, my dear boy, the condition I stipulated before your touching that bow is bilateral... I clearly said that my daughter belongs to one who can lift that bow... you were quick enough to grab the girl, rather than the bow... and in that hastiness you even broke that bow... had you declined the girl, you should have declined to lift the bow, also... so,<em>iyam siita</em> was the only intention of yours when lifting that bow..."
1-73-49,"Rama; Maybe.. but we want high-born, high-bred girls --- not fatherless, motherless, birth-less orphans"
1-73-50,"Janaka: You seem to be a doubting Thomas... that&#39;s why I said <em>mama sutaa</em> &#39;my daughter &#39; when it is said <em>mahataa tapasaa raama...</em> &#39; by high degree ascesis Dasharatha obtained Rama.. what does it mean? So also, I too obtained and fostered this girl with much better ascesis [than your father], and even protected her from warring factions [only to give back to you ]; bythe way, the environ of Mithila itself is of utmost sanctity and piety... if we are to be lowly subjects, why your guru Vishvamitra brought you here, that too by foot don&#39;t think that you are taking this girl for your personal enjoyment, but it is for a caculated purpose... this girl meets that purpose and her wifehood, as well.... hence I said<em>sahadharmacarii tava</em> &#39; she will be in toe with your duties&#39;"
1-73-51,"<em>tava dharmasahacarii</em> &#39; whatever is your duty that duty become hers too &#39;.."
1-73-52,"Rama: Somehow there appears some cacoethes confusion from you, from all the sages, from my father and mothers, even"
1-73-53,"Janaka: Nothing of that sort is there... if you wish heartily then only you take her... I have not said <em>siitaam dadaami</em> &#39;I am donating Seetha &#39; but I said <em>pratiicCha enaam</em> &#39;take her, take her back &#39; or else, she will exit as she came and unfulfilled will be your mission... it is up to you to decide.... no compulsion whatsoever..."
1-73-54,"Rama: Then, let her take hold of my arrow and walk with me round the Altar of Fire, because, for Kshatriya-s that is the custom..."
1-73-55,"Janaka: I know, I know, but this marriage does not fit into any of the eight kinds of marriage prescribed for humans... hence I carefully said <em>paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa</em>&#39; take her palm into your palm &#39;"

1-73-58,"Janaka: To be in tune with this world&#39;s tradition... however, this marriage technically comes under the category of <em>praajaapatya</em>"
1-73-59,"Rama: So, you adjusted the rule books... then why me, let her take my hand..."
1-73-60,"Janaka: The enjoyer has to grab the object of enjoyment, not vice versa... take her now and <em>bhadram te</em> and &#39;be blest &#39;"
1-73-61,"Janaka: <em>iyam</em> - &#39;this&#39; girl is a simple match to you who broke the bow of Shiva;"
1-73-62,"<em>siitaa</em>&#39; born in furrow&#39; a motherless girl, hence, kindly be merciful towards her;"
1-73-63,"<em>mama sutaa</em> &#39; my daughter &#39; rather, a poor fellow&#39;s daughter; where I have always been engaged in rituals and ceremonies, thereby I may not have brought her up properly, and thereby if she does talk rashly or behave oddly, like an ill-bred girl, kindly tolerate and correct her;"
1-73-64,"<em>sahadhrmacarii iva</em> where <em>iva</em> is &#39; like &#39; just take her like your &#39;custom-bound consort &#39; and let her be useful in ceremonies and rituals, though not for pleasure trips and excursions &#39;;"
1-73-65,"<em>pratiicCha enaam</em> &#39;take her &#39; where the bridegrooms usually woo, court and date girls, send many messages to her parents asking for that girl in marriage; but, this girl being an uncommon one, I am begging you to take her;"
1-73-66,"<em>paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa</em> you take her hand as she is hesitating to take your hand, for your hand is strong enough to break an unbreakable bow, she is fearing to take your hand, lest her arm too will be broken;"
1-73-67,"<em>bhadram te</em> &#39;be blest &#39; when you honour our appeal"
1-73-68,"And there are many, many more shades of meanings derived from this verse, but all culminate to say - &#39;you two are made for each other &#39;"
1-73-69,"She who is prosperous and husband-devout, will always be abiding you like your own shadow... So saying that king Janaka then poured forth water into the palms of Rama, which is sanctified with hymns. [1-73-27b, 28a]"
1-73-70,"Then there occurred great flower-showers from firmament, while sages and gods staying in firmament have exclaimed, nice... fine... to the drumbeats of heavenly drums. [1-3-28b, 29a]"
1-73-71,"On handing over his daughter Seetha who is duly sanctified with sanctified waters, King Janaka is completely overwhelmed with exhilaration for the successful performance of his bit as a father and he said this. [1-73-29b, 30a]"
1-73-72,"Come on, Lakshmana, safe betides you... say yes to Urmila, the one who is decided by me to be given to you... take her palm into yours... lapse not the time... [1-73-30b, 31a]"
1-73-73,"Janaka having said to Lakshmana that way, he also addressed Bharata, Oh, Bharata, the delight of Raghu-s, take Maandavi&#39;s palm into your palm... [1-73-31b-32a]"
1-73-74,"That honourable king of Mithila even said to Shatrughna, oh, dextrous Shatrughna, take the palm of Shrutakiirti into yours... [1-73-32b, 33a]"
1-73-75,"Oh, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna ... you all are tender-hearted, well-behaved and well-intentioned brothers from Kakutstha lineage... without lapse of time take up other ceremonies... So said Janaka to bridegrooms. [1-73-33b, 34a]"
1-73-76,"All the four bridegrooms are palminpalmed with all the four brides, paying heed to Janaka&#39;s words, and abiding in Vashishta&#39;s orchestration of Vedic hymns and procedures. [1-73-34b, 35a]"
1-73-77,"On performing circumambulations along with their wives around the Ritual-fire, and around the Altar of Fire, and that way, around king Janaka, the awarder of wives, and around sages as well for they conducted the marriages well, those great-souled bridegrooms that have emerged from Raghu&#39;s dynasty on performing further deeds of ritual consistent with custom as directed by Vashishta, they are all wed. [1-73-35b, 36]"
1-73-78,"There occurred rich and highly dazzling flower showers from firmament, and that ambience is filled with the drumbeats of divine drums and with vocal and instrumental music, and promenades of apsara-s danced, and even the gandharva-s sang tunefully, and because it is the marriage of celebrated bridegrooms from Raghu&#39;s dynasty, such a charming spectacle is envisioned.. [1-73-37, 38]"
1-73-79,"In this kind of ongoingness of harmonious music of vocal, instrumental and that of dancers, those great resplendent brothers married their wives on circumabulating the Ritual-fire fire thrice. [1-73-39]"
1-73-80,"Then those legatees of Raghu went to their visitatorial-palace with their wives, followed by king Dasharatha along with the assemblages of sages, kinfolks, queens and wives included, and Dasharatha feasted his eyes on sons and daughter-in-laws. [1-73-40]"
1-74-1," When that night is elapsing into the wee hours of next day, then the eminent-saint  Vishvamitra on asking for the leave of absence from those kings, Dasharatha and Janaka, and from  both Rama and Lakshmana, he set out to northern mountains, namely Himalayas. [1-74-1]"
1-74-2," When Vishvamitra departed that ruler to the delight of people, namely Dasharatha,  on asking leave of absence with king Janaka who outvies bodily affairs, promptly set forth for  the city of Ayodhya. [1-74-2]"
1-74-3," Then that king Janaka of Mithila, the one from Videha lineage, gave innumerable  patrimonial riches. He has also given umpteen number of cows, millions of excellent shawls and  silk dresses, and elephants, horses, chariots, foot soldiers, besides hundreds of highly  decorated girls, divine in their mien, as unexcelled chambermaids and handmaidens to the brides.  [1-74-3, 4, 5a]"
1-74-4," King Janaka gave beau idéal bridal riches in gold, silver, pearls and corals even,  for he is very highly gladdened as Seetha's marriage came true. [1-74-5b, 6a]"
1-74-5," Having given many kinds of bridal gifts and having accompanied his daughters for a  distance, then having received a bid adieu from Dasharatha, that sovereign of Mithila, Janaka,  re-entered is own palace in Mithila. [1-74-6, 7a]"
1-74-6," Even the king Dasharatha, the sovereign of Ayodhya proceeded with his noble-souled  sons, keeping all the sages in the fore, while his forces followed him. [1-74-7b, 8a]"
1-74-7," But while going with the assemblages of sages and with young Raghava-s, namely  Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, the sky-bound birds started to screech with startling voice  from all around facing that tigerly-man Dasharatha. [1-74-8b, 9a]"
1-74-8," Also thus, all of the earth bound animals are going his leftward, and on seeing  this, albeit he is a tigerly king he is perplexed, and particularly asked Vashishta. [1-74-9b,  10a]"
1-74-9," ""Unpropitious is the starling voicing of birds, whereby my heart is throbbing  down... and propitious is the leftward going of the animals, thereby my heart is throbbing up...  why so?"" [1-74-10b, 11a]"
1-74-10," On hearing all that is said by king Dasharatha, the instinctual sage Vashishta  said this sentence in a soothing voice, ""I will tell apart the result of these auguries...  [1-74-11b, 12a]"
1-74-11," ""The shrieks voiced by the birds are foretokening the forthcoming providential and  perilous trepidation, but the behaviour of these animals is betokening it as mitigable... hence,  let this consternation be forsaken... [1-74-12b, 13a]"
1-74-12," While they are discussing among themselves, a whirlwind started to whirligig  there, as though to shake the earth and shatter all gigantic trees. [1-74-13b, 14a]"
1-74-13," Murkiness enshrouded the sun, thus everyone is unaware of quarters, a sandstorm  enwrapped that army, by which it has become as though ensorcelled. [1-74-14b, 15a]"
1-74-14," Then Vashishta and the other sages, the king Dasharatha along with his sons  remained there with animation, and everything and every other one available there has become  inanimate. [1-74-15b, 16a]"
1-74-15," In that catastrophic darkness, that sand-muffled military of king Dasharatha has  seen the son of Sage Jamadagni, namely Bhaargava Rama, the subjugator of kings of kings. He  appeared calamitous in his look by wearing tufty matted and unruly head-hair, an unassailable one  like Mt. Kailash, an unbearable one like the Epoch-End-Fire, irradiant with his own radiance,  hence imperceivable for commoners, and such as he is, he clinched an axe on his right shoulder  and clasped a bow in his left hand, that in simile is like a congeries of electroluminescence,  and handling an arrow which is as if ready to electrocute, and he vied in his overall look with  the devastator of triple cities, namely God Shiva. [1-74-16b, 17, 18, 19]"
1-74-16," On seeing him who is perilous in his propensity and flaming like the Ritual-fire,  Vashishta and the other prominent Brahman-s who are the practisers of meditation and  fire-oblations have come together and started to susurrate, up and down. [1-74-20, 21a]"
1-74-17," ""Will he eradicate the race of Kshatriya-s even now as he was once envenomed by  the murder of his father, or what... abated is his anger and alleviated is his frenzy previously  when he eliminated Kshatriya-s... but is he really intending to eliminate Kshatriya-s once again,  or what?"" Thus, those Brahmans talked among themselves. [1-74-21b, 22]"
1-74-18," After their susurrus the sages have approached him, who in his very look is like a  visitation, with oblational water and addressed him with benign words of greeting like, ""oh,  Rama, oh, Bhaargava Rama..."" [1-74-23]"
1-74-19," On receiving the deference paid by the sage Vashishta, that inexorable Rama of  Jamadagni started to talk to Rama of Dasharatha. [1-74-24]"
1-75-1,"Oh, valiant Rama of Dasharatha, your valour is bruited as a sensational valour, and sensational is your smashing of Shiva&#39;s bow, also thus I have thoroughly heard about your others deeds like elimination of Tataka et cetera... [1-75-1]"
1-75-2,"That way, smashing of that particular bow of Shiva is wondrous and even unimaginable... on hearing that alone I happened upon you, bringing another outranking bow... [1-75-2]"
1-75-3,"This alone is that catastrophic bow received through Sage Jamadagni... flex it with an arrow on bowstring stretching up to your ear, and in that way show your capability... [1-75-3]"
1-75-4,"Thereby, on examining your strength in your taking aim with this bow, and should you be deservedly valorous, I will give you a combative duel... So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. [1-75-4]"
1-75-5,"On hearing that sentence of Bhaargava Rama, then king Dasharatha became a pitiable one, and with a downcast face and adjoined palms said this. [1-75-5]"
1-75-6,"Aren&#39;t you a Brahman with inviolable ascesis, and whose rancour on Kshatriya-s has calmed down long back. Why this hostility again. It&#39;ll be apt of you to award aegis to my sons, for they are yet youngsters... [1-75-6]"
1-75-7,"Aren&#39;t you from the bloodline of Bhaargava-s who always conduct themselves in self-study of Vedas and self-principled ways... haven&#39;t you readily discarded weapon-wielding on your promise to Thousand-eyed Indra... [1-75-7]"
1-75-8,"Such as you were, you on becoming a dedicatee to probity, haven&#39;t you given the planet earth to Kashyapa and haven&#39;t you repaired to forests, and haven&#39;t you flagged yourself on Mt. Mahendra... [1-75-8]"
1-75-9,"Or, oh, insurmountable sage, have you chanced upon us for a total annihilation of ours... when Rama is singularised and eliminated, nay-said that we all will be living... Thus Dasharatha had gone on appealing in his love for his sons. [1-75-9]"
1-75-10,"While Dasharatha is speaking in that way that intransigent Bhaargava Rama of Sage Jamadagni uncaring for those merciful words of Dasharatha addressed Rama of Dasharatha alone. [1-75-10]"
1-75-11,"These are the two strong and sturdy unsurpassed longbows, well-designed by gods and well-crafted by Vishvakarma, the Divine Architect, and these are very important among all bows and well-worshipped by all worlds... one broken in your, and the other in my hand... [1-75-11]"
1-75-12,"Oh, best one among men, out of the two longbows gods gave one to restive Trymbaka, God Shiva for a combat with demon Tripura, and oh, Kakutstha, that bow alone is the annihilator of Tripura, the demon... and you have broken that alone... [1-75-12]"
1-75-13,"This is the second one and the choicest gods gave this to Vishnu, thereby this is named after Him as &#39;Vishnu&#39;s bow...&#39; this is an indestructible and enemy-citadel conquering longbow... and this is identical in its efficacy with Rudra&#39;s longbow... [1-75-13, 14a]"
1-75-14,"Once, all the gods were asking the Grandparent, Brahma, as to who is powerful and who is less powerful among the blue-throated Shiva and Vishnu... but the Grandparent Brahma on inferring the intent of gods started to create adversity among those two, Shiva and Vishnu, for the Grandparent is the best adherer of truthfulness, as truth cannot be demonstrated on hearsay evidence... [1-75-14b, 15, 16a]"
1-75-15,Legend:
1-75-16,"<font color=""#B3003A"">Legend:</font> Brahma thought that it would better to enact a drama to cleanse the one-sided mentalities of these lesser gods. So, he started to write the script, and himself becoming the writer-director of that drama. That script is hereunder."
1-75-17,Legend:
1-75-18,"Brahma: Mahadeva, who is the destroyer of Tripura, or say triple-citadels?"
1-75-19,"Shiva: Why? It is me, of course..."
1-75-20,"Brahma: Why do you boast that way of yourself? It is the long-arrow of your longbow, isn&#39;t it?"
1-75-21,"Shiva: Yes of course..."
1-75-22,"Brahma: Then Vishnu was presiding deity of that long-bow... isn&#39;t t?"
1-75-23,"Shiva: Yes, it is he, but I shot it from my bow... basically, is this a confusion, or, are you playing any part of Narada..."
1-75-24,"Brahma: Not so, the other day Vishnu was telling that he alone did that master task..."
1-75-25,"Shiva: How can it be! In the triple of doer-deed-instrument, instrument cannot become the doer... has his language gone topsy-turvy, noun is becoming verb and verb is lost to adjective and..."
1-75-26,"Brahma: Ok, Ok... we do not care much for grammar as we care more for communication, grammar is paNini&#39;s headache... but what he said is that he alone did it... not you..."
1-75-27,"Shiva: Then why I am called... why that longbow is given to me... you should have got it done by Vishnu... why calling me... you have unnecessarily spoiled my dance program..."
1-75-28,"Brahma: Not that... I said what he said... let&#39;s not quarrel among ourselves..."
1-75-29,"Shiva: I not only quarrel but wage war, if it comes to my interests and my devotees&#39; interest... how many times I have not done so..."
1-75-30,"Brahma: That is what Vishnu was telling... every time you give a boon to every demon, and involve yourself in enmeshment, and Vishnu has come to come and rescue... have he forgotten the episode of bhasmaasura... thus Vishnu is saying and asking..."
1-75-31,"Shiva: Now I don&#39;t tolerate... I will take him to task..."
1-75-32,"Exit Shiva - Enter Vishnu. Brahma reverses the above dialogue and says that to Vishnu"
1-75-33,"Vishnu: No, No, highly objectionable... I will take him to task... I will take him to task..."
1-75-34,"Exit All. War Started."
1-75-35,"Owing to their animosity then occurred a fierce and hair-raising war among Shiva and Vishnu, as each aspired victory for himself... [1-75-16b, 17a]"
1-75-36,"By the &#39;hum&#39; sound of Vishnu that ruinously overpowering longbow of Shiva is broken, and the triple-eyed God, Mahadeva, is frozen... [1-75-17b, 18a]"
1-75-37,"Then gods along with the assemblages of sages and celestial carana-s have come together and appealed to those two for appeasement in the matter of wielding authority, and then those two superior gods, Shiva and Vishnu, went into a state of amity... [1-75-18b, 19a]"
1-75-38,"On seeing the bow of Shiva rendered inert by the mettlesomeness of Vishnu, from then on the gods along with the assemblages of sages deemed Vishnu to be the paramount... [1-75-19b, 20a]"
1-75-39,"That celebrated Rudra on his part with indignation has handed over that longbow, which is already fitted with unloosened arrow, to the sagely king among Videha kings, namely Devaraata... [1-75-20b, 21a]"
1-75-40,"Oh, Rama, this alone is that enemy-citadel conquering longbow of Vishnu, and Vishnu handed over this to Sage Riciika, the son of Bhrigu, as a trustworthy trust... [1-75-21b, 22a]"
1-75-41,"That great-resplendent Sage Riciika on his part has handed over this divine bow to his son with unmatchable deeds of religious merit, who is my father Sage Jamadagni... [1-75-22b, 23a]"
1-75-42,"Adhering to a barbarous mentality Kaartaviirya Arjuna put my father to death, when the ascetically powerful father of mine has isolated himself from arsenal... [1-75-23b, 24a]"
1-75-43,"Oh, Rama, on hearing the unregenerate and highly perfidious murdering of my father, I rancorously extirpated Kshatriya-s as and when they are born, that too not for one time, but I did so for thirty-seven times going around the earth... and on getting the entire earth under my control I performed Vedic-ritual, and at the end of that Vedic-ritual, I gave all that earth to sage Kashyapa, a sage with divine soul and with pious observances, as a ritualistic-generosity... and I am at present on Mt. Mahendra practising ascesis and thus conjoined are the powers of ascesis in me... [1-75-24b, c, 25, 26a]"
1-75-44,"On hearing about the breakage of Shiva&#39;s longbow, then I promptly came here. Thereby, oh, Rama, wield this supernatural and superlative longbow of Vishnu, which is passed on to me from my forefathers and my father. Keep your fealty to Kshatriya-hood in view, and wield this as you have wielded Shiva&#39;s longbow... [1-75-26b, 27]"
1-75-45,"Take an aim with an arrow that conquers enemy&#39;s citadels fixing it on this supramundane longbow... and oh, Kakutstha, should you be capable of it, thereafter I will give you a duel... [1-75-27]"
1-76-1,"On hearing that sentence of Rama of Jamadagni, then Rama of Dasharatha said this to him in a courtly owing to the presence of his father Dasharatha. [1-76-1]"
1-76-2,"Oh, Bhaargava Rama, whatsoever endeavour you have strived for freeing yourself from the indebtedness towards your father, I have heard of them, and oh, Brahman, we appreciate for your achieving that freeness from your paternal debt, but... [1-76-2]"
1-76-3,"Oh, Bhaargava Rama, demeaning me as though I am timorous, hence incapable to handle the bow, and hence I am an ignoble one for Kshatriya-hood, is meaningless... come on, now you may see my spiritedness and sprightliness... So said Rama to Bhaargava. [1-76-3]"
1-76-4,"Raghava, the nimble-handed vanquisher of his opponents, speaking thus in high dudgeon expropriated that estimable weapon, namely the longbow of Vishnu, from the hand of Bhaargava Rama, along with the long-arrow that is already fitted on it... [1-76-4]"
1-76-5,"On lifting up the bow that is already fitted with an arrow on bowstring, then Rama started to take aim with it, but being indecisive about the target, then Rama of Dasharatha irefully said this to Rama of Jamagadni. [1-76-5]"
1-76-6,"Oh Rama of Bhaargava, even if you are a Brahman you are eliminable, but because of your relationship with Vishvamitra, and because you are a venerable one for me, I am disinclined to release this arrow that exterminates your life... [1-76-6]"
1-76-7,"Oh Bhaargava Rama, either this motility of yours at the speed of your mind, or even those unparalleled realms of heavens which you have earned by the power of your ascesis, I will eliminate whichever you wish... [1-76-7]"
1-76-8,"This Vishnu&#39;s divine arrow is the conqueror of opponents&#39; citadels, and a vanquisher of their vigour and vainglory, and it will not fall through wastefully... isn&#39;t it! So said archer Rama to axeman Rama. [1-76-8]"
1-76-9,"Gods together with the assemblages of sages have come keeping the Grandparent Brahma at their fore, likewise the gandharva-s, apsara-s, siddha-s, caarana-s, kinnaraa-s, yaksha-s, sprites and reptilian beings have also come to see Rama who is now wielding the extraordinary longbow of Vishnu, and extremely amazing event that is going to ensue. [1-76-9, 10]"
1-76-10,"Then, when Rama is ready to take aim with the arrow on that inscrutable longbow, and when the worlds are being rendered as insentient, then that Rama of Jamadagni is rendered vigourless and he stared up at Rama of Dasharatha. [1-76-11]"
1-76-11,"Rama of Jamadagni is calloused as his vitality is subdued by the radiance of that lotus-petal eyed Rama of Dasharatha, and he spoke to Rama of Dasharatha, slowly and softly. [1-76-12]"
1-76-12,"Once, when I donated entire earth to Sage Kashyapa, Kashyapa told me &#39;uninhabitable is my domain, viz., this earth for you...&#39; thus... [1-76-13]"
1-76-13,"Such as I was, in my observance of my mentor Kashyapa&#39;s order I do not spend nights on this earth from then afterwards, oh, Kakutstha Rama, as I made over this earth for Kashyapa, indeed... [1-76-14]"
1-76-14,"Thereby oh, valiant one, it will be inapt of you to impair this motility of mine, oh, Raghava, I will depart with the speed of cerebration to Mt. Mahendra, a par excellent mountain... [1-76-15]"
1-76-15,"But I triumphed over matchless realms of heavens with my ascesis, oh, Rama, you may hash them up with that irreversible arrow... let there be no time-lag... [1-76-16]"
1-76-16,"I have realized your touch of nature as that of the Immutable Supreme Being, God of Gods, the Exterminator of the demon Madhu, namely Vishnu, by the touch of your handling that bow... oh, enemy-inflamer, blessedness alone betides you... [1-76-17]"
1-76-17,"All of these gods who have come collectively are beholding you and your next move, for you are an unequalled one in your achievements and to whom there is no counter-dueller in conflicts... [1-76-18]"
1-76-18,"Oh, Kakutstha Rama, you are the lord of the triad of worlds, such as you are, you faced me down, and it is malapropos to say that this is a disgrace to me... [1-76-19]"
1-76-19,"It will be apt of you to unloose that unsurpassed arrow, oh, Rama, as you have ethical commitment to wipe out demons as I wiped out menacing kings, and should you unloosen that arrow now I wish to depart to the ethereal mountain Mt. Mahendra, a point of no return for me... So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama. [1-76-20]"
1-76-20,"While Rama of Jamadagni is speaking that way, that venturesome and blessed Rama of Dasharatha shot off that nonpareil arrow from that longbow of Vishnu. [1-76-21]"
1-76-21,"On seeing all of his realms of heavens are shot-blasted by Rama of Dasharatha, Rama of Jamadagni vanished in a trice to Mt. Mahendra, the heavenly mountain. [1-76-22]"
1-76-22,"Then dissipated is the darkness in all the divisions and likewise in all the subdivisions of compass, and the gods with the assemblages of sages extolled Rama, in whose hands the longbow is upraised. [1-76-23]"
1-76-23,"Then that dab hand at axe, Rama of Jamadagni, on acclaiming, and even on making circumambulations to Rama of Dasharatha, went on his own way into oblivion. [1-76-24]"
1-77-1,"On the departure of Rama of Jamadagni, that most glorious Rama of Dasharatha is quietened at heart, and he gave away that longbow of Vishnu into the hand of inimitable Rain-god. [1-77-1]"
1-77-2,"On paying respects to sage Vashishta and to the other important sages, Rama, the delight of Raghu&#39;s lineage, placatingly addressed his agitated father Dasharatha. [1-77-2]"
1-77-3,"Rama of Jamadagni has gone on his way, you may now order the army under your wardship, for which you are the lord, to move on towards Ayodhya... So said Rama to his father. [1-77-3]"
1-77-4,"On hearing the words of Rama king Dasharatha hugged his son with both of his arms, and kissed on the forehead of Raghava, and king Dasharatha is gladdened to listen about the departure of Parashu Rama, and then he is further gladdened in deeming that he and his sons took a rebirth. [1-77-4, 5]"
1-77-5,"Then the King Dasharatha ordered that legion to move ahead, and then they all went towards delightful city Ayodhya, whose royal highways are wetted with water, sprinkled with bunches of flowers, decorated with banners and bannerettes up above them, and reverberating with high sounding bugle-horns. Further, those highways are replete with urbanites welcomers who are handling welcoming kits which are golden handy-crates or plates in which lit camphor, fragrant incenses, vermilion powder, flowers to shower on the incomers are arranged, and those highways are well-decorated with throngs of people who are glee-faced at their king&#39;s re-entry, and into such an exhilarating city Ayodhya king Dasharatha and his retinue entered. [1-77-7, 8a]"
1-77-6,"When the citizenry and city-dwelling Brahman-s have received him from a distance, that illustrious king Dasharatha followed by his phenomenal and praiseworthy sons then entered his happy house and home, which is like the lofty and lordly Himalayan palazzo. [1-77-8b, 9]"
1-77-7,"In palace king Dasharatha is overjoyed when he is surrounded with his own inmates of palace-chambers, and when his long cherished ambitions have come true, while his queens, Kausalya, Sumitra, and slender waisted Kaikeyi and other wives are overjoyed in the functions of receiving the four brides.

2-4-13,"Oh gallant Rama! I also enjoyed all the comforts, as I desired. Thus I am relievedof all debts to the celestials (by performing holy sacrifices), to the sages (by studying Vedasetc.), to my ancestors (by begetting you), to the Brahmans (by giving away donations and food) andto myself (by enjoying all comforts as I desired)."
2-4-14,"I have no duty other than to anoint you for the crown. Hence, do what I tellyou."
2-4-15,"Now all the people want you to be the king. Hence, I can install you asprince."
2-4-16,"Oh, Rama! It is not only the people's desire, but also these days I am gettingfearful and inauspicious dreams. Here, thunderous comets are falling with great sound, during daytime."
2-4-17,"Oh, Rama! Astrologers are informing me that fearful planets like Sun, Mars and Rahuare encroaching my birth star."
2-4-18,"Whenever such inauspicious signs are produced, the king generally will get eitherdeath or a fearful accident."
2-4-19,"Oh, Rama! Hence, before my mind gets changed, get you anointed to the crown. Arenot the minds of men unstable?"
2-4-20,"Today, the moon is entering the constellation known as Punarvasu which comes beforePushyami star. The astrologers inform that the coronation ceremony can be fixed for tomorrow, whenthe moon joins Pushyami star."
2-4-21,"Hence, get anointed for the crown on the day of Pushyami star. My mind is urging meas it were to expedite things. O, annihilator of the enemies! I shall anoint you for the princelykingdom tomorrow."
2-4-22,"That is why, with self control, you along with your wife should observe fast forthis night from now onwards, and sleep on a couch made of Kusha grass."
2-4-23,"Generally, there are many obstacles for such type of functions. Hence, your friendsshould guard you vigilantly from all directions."
2-4-24,"It is my opinion that your coronation function should occur, while Bharata is awayfrom the city."
2-4-25," Bharata, your brother, goes according to his eldest brother. He is righteous,compassionate and has the senses under control. He verily follows the path of good people."
2-4-26,"Oh, Rama! It is my opinion that minds of men are inconstant. But the everrighteous, endowed with goodness, sometimes may act unexpectedly on impulse."
2-4-27,"Dasaratha, after telling in this way about the ensuing coronation ceremony scheduledfor the next day, permitted Rama to depart. Rama offered his salutations to his father and went tohis house."
2-4-28,"After hearing the decision of Dasaratha regarding coronation ceremony, Rama enteredhis house and by starting immediately, went to his mother's queenly house."
2-4-29,"There, in the queen's worshipping place, Rama saw Kausalya silently in meditation,wearing silk clothes and praying to goddess Lakshmi."
2-4-30,"Hearing the good news of the coronation ceremony of Rama, Sumitra and Lakshmana camethere even before Seetha was brought."
2-4-31,"At that time, Kausalya closed her eyes and was in meditation. Along with her,Sumitra, Lakshmana and Seetha were sitting nearby."
2-4-32,"Hearing that her son will be anointed for the princely kingdom on the day ofPushyami star, Kausalya with controlled breath, was meditating on lord Vishnu."
2-4-33,"Rama approached his mother, even while she was engaged in pious observance, offeredsalutation and spoke the following words making her delighted."
2-4-34,"Oh, mother! My father ordered that I should rule the people. As per his orders,there will be anointing ceremony to me tomorrow."
2-4-35,"Seetha too, along with me should observe fast this whole night. The father togetherwith preceptors and teachers said this to me."
2-4-36,"Have all the auspicious rites that are required for the ensuing tomorrow'sanointment ceremony, performed to me and to Seetha today."
2-4-37,"Hearing the news of anointment ceremony, which was being desired by her for a longtime, Kausalya spoke to Rama the following sweet words with tears of joy in her eyes."
2-4-38,"Oh, child Rama! You live a long life! Let your enemies be destroyed! Let thecousins of mine and of Sumitra be made happy by your glory."
2-4-39,"O, my little son! You were born to me on a day of an auspicious star. That is why,your father king Dasaratha was propitiated by your virtues."
2-4-40,"O, son! My worship to the lotus eyed Lord Vishnu with endurance has becomefruitful. Hence, this glorious kingdom of Ikshvaku dynasty is going to embrace you."
2-4-41,"Rama, after hearing the words spoken by his mother, saw his brother Lakshmana whowas sitting humbly nearby with joined palms and spoke to him smilingly as follows:"
2-4-42,"O, Lakshmana! You rule this earth together with me. This glorious kingdom hasreached you, who are my second conscience."
2-4-43,"O, Lakshmana! You enjoy the benefits as desired by you and the fruits of kingdom. Idesire to live and even to rule the kingdom but for you."
2-4-44,"Rama, after speaking thus to Lakshmana, offered salutations to both the mothers, gotSeetha to obtain permission from them and went to his house along with Seetha."
2-5-1,"After Rama left, king Dasaratha called for his family priest Vasishta and spoke tohim as follows about the ensuing anointment ceremony of the next day."
2-5-2,"O, great sage Vasishta! Please go to the avowed Rama and Seetha today to make themperform fasting for obtaining prosperity, glory and sovereignty."
2-5-3,"Vasista, who is the best of knowers of Veda, who is expert in mantras, who is firmin austerities and who is divine, said to Dasaratha : ""I agree to it"" and personally went to Rama'shouse on a chariot which was ready and quite suitable for a Brahman; so as to advise Rama toundertake a fast (with mantras) performed by Rama, a knower of mantras."
2-5-4,"That great sage reached Rama's house, which was radiant like a dense white cloud andentered the three gateways of the house by the chariot itself."
2-5-5,"To respect the honorable sage, who arrived, Rama came quickly and hurriedly out ofthe house."
2-5-6,"Rama quickly got nearer to Vasishta's chariot and personally helped him to alightfrom the chariot."
2-5-7,"That family priest Vasishta seeing that lovable and humble Rama, spoke the followingwords, bringing cheerfulness and happiness to him:"
2-5-8,"O, Rama! Your father is delighted with you. You will be getting the princelykingdom. Hence, you and Seetha perform fasting today."
2-5-9,"Your father; King Dasaratha is anointing you affectionately for the princelykingdom tomorrow at dawn; even as king Nahusha has done to Yayati."
2-5-10,"Vasistha thus spoke to Rama and enjoined him to undertake a vow of fasting togetherwith Seetha, in the accompaniment of mantras."
2-5-11,"Thereafter, Rama worshipped the royal priest Vasistha suitably. Vasistha then gotRama's permission and left his house."
2-5-12,"Rama spent some time by delightedly talking with friends and having beencongratulated by them in various ways went into his palace after taking leave of them."
2-5-13,"Then, Rama's house was shining, as brilliantly with delighted men and women, as alake filled with opened lotuses and visited by innumerable happy birds."
2-5-14,"Vasishta, leaving Rama's house, which seemed like the royal palace, saw the wayfilled with people."
2-5-15,"All the royal highways in the city of Ayodhya were filled with groups and groups ofdelighted people and became congested."
2-5-16,"Then, on the royal road, the resonance created by the rush of the people, movinghither and thither like waves, combined with their rejoicing, resounded like the roar of anocean."
2-5-17,"On that day, in the city of Ayodhya, all the roads were cleaned and sprinkled withwater. There were rows of trees on both sides of the roads and flags hoisted on houses."
2-5-18,"Then, the people of Ayodhya including children, women and the old-aged were waitingfor sunrise, wishing the anointment ceremony of Rama to happen."
2-5-19,"In Ayodhya, people were enthusiastic to see the great public function, which wasdecorative to the community and which would bring forward an increased joy."
2-5-20,"Vasishta, thus seeing the king's way being overcrowded with people, reached theroyal palace slowly by forcing a passage through that crowd."
2-5-21,"He walked up the royal palace, which was akin to the top of a mountain enclosed by awhite cloud and met king Dasaratha in the manner Brihaspati met Devendra."
2-5-22,"Seeing Vasistha had returned, King Dasaratha alighted from his throne and asked himwith regard to his mission. Vasistha informed him that it was accomplished."
2-5-23,"The members of assembly who were sitting along with the king till then, raised inobeisance to Vasishta from their seats, following the example of the king."
2-5-24,"King Dasaratha, after obtaining permission from Vasishta, left that assembly of menand entered his palace as a lion enters a mountain cave."
2-5-25,"That palace with women in top dress and form was like the palace of Devendra. By theentering of King Dasaratha, the palace became more radiant, just as the moon radiates a beautifulsky with its stars."
2-6-1,"After Vasistha left, Rama took bath and meditated on Lord Narayana with undistractedmind along with his wide-eyed wife, Seetha."
2-6-2,"Taking the vessel with clarified butter on his head as per scriptures, he offered toLord Vishnu the clarified butter, by dropping it into the blazing fire."
2-6-3,"Rama ate the remainder of clarified butter after finishing the sacrifice, which heperformed for his own good, silently meditated on Lord Narayana with controlled mind and sleptalong with Seetha on a properly laid bed of Kusa grass in a splendid temple of Lord Vishnu. *"
2-6-4,"Rama woke up three hours before dawn and caused to complete the entire decoration ofthe house."
2-6-5,"Listening to the pleasing verses of professional reciters, he worshipped the earlysunrise and meditated on Gayatri* with an undistracted mind."
2-6-6,"He praised Lord Vishnu by bowing his head before Him. By wearing pure silk clothes,he got valedictory text recited by Brahmans."
2-6-7,"Their deep and sweet chorus of the valedictory, united with the accompanying musicalinstruments, then filled the city of Ayodhya."
2-6-8,"All the people residing in Ayodhya were delighted when they heard that Rama andSeetha had observed fast for the ensuing anointment ceremony."
2-6-9,"All the citizens decorated the town for coronation function of Rama, soon beforesunrise."
2-6-10,"Banners and colorful flags were hoisted on temples, which looked brilliantly likethe silver lining of cloud, at road junctions, in streets, on big trees situated in templecompounds, from watching towers at city gates, on shops of wealthy merchants, on buildings of richfamily persons, on all assembly halls and all visible trees."
2-6-11,"From different sides, actors were showing their talents, dancers were performingdance. Singers were singing and sweet voices were heard, pleasing the minds and ears."
2-6-12,"With Rama's anointment ceremony approaching, people were engaged in mutualconversations in their houses and at road junctions, about the ceremony."
2-6-13,"Even children playing together before gateways of houses were telling each other,narratives of Rama's anointment ceremony."
2-6-14,"The citizens made king's road splendid, by sprinkling flowers on it and by making itgood smelling with burning of incense and perfumes, on the occasion of Rama's anointmentceremony."
2-6-15,"On a doubt of approach of night on completion of the ceremony, they arranged lampsin the shape of trees to illuminate all the streets."
2-6-16,"All the citizens residing in Ayodhya, having thus decorated the city desiring Rama'scoronation, gathered together in groups at road junctions and in assembly halls, mutually talkingabout this matter there and praising king Dasaratha."
2-6-17,"O! This king Dasaratha, who delights Ikshvaaku dynasty, having known himself thathe became aged, is going to anoint Rama for the kingdom. What a great man he is!"
2-6-18,"Rama; who has seen the totality of the world is going to become our protector forlong. We have all been blessed by king Dasaratha."
2-6-19,"Rama is modest, knowledgeable and righteous. He is as compassionate to us as to hisbrothers."
2-6-20,"Let the faultless and righteous king Dasaratha live long! Due to his blessings, weare going to see Rama as being anointed for the kingdom."
2-6-21,"The villagers, who came from different directions after hearing the news ofcoronation ceremony of Rama, listened to the narration of the citizens of Ayodhya."
2-6-22,"The city of Ayodhya was filled with villagers who came from different directions tosee the anointment ceremony of Rama."
2-6-23,"The noise in the city was heard by the groups of those people, while moving here andthere, as the roaring of an impetuous ocean on full moon days."
2-6-24,"That city of Ayodhya equal to the residence of the celestial god Indra, disturbedwith the sound being made all over by the villagers who came with the desire to see the ceremony,shone like a roaring ocean filled with sea animals."
2-7-1,"Manthara, a housemaid who was residing with Kaikeyi since her birth, accidentallyascended the balcony of Kaikeyi's white palace, which resembled the full moon."
2-7-2,"Manthara, from that balcony, saw the entire city of Ayodhya, with all its principalroads being sprinkled with water and strewn with heaps of flowers."
2-7-3,"Manthara further saw from that balcony the city decorated with the best of flags andbanners. The roads were cleared for uninterrupted traffic. All the people took head-bath. Brahmanswith flowers and sweets in their hands were chanting Mantras. The gateways of temples were whitewashed. There were sounds of all musical instruments. The city was filled with rejoicing people andresounding chant of Vedas. The elephants and horses were also merry. The bulls were making roaringnoise. The highly delighted citizens hoisted rows of flags on their housetops."
2-7-4,"Manthara asked a house maid with bright pleasing eyes and wearing white silk clothesstanding nearby, as follows: -"
2-7-5,"Why is Kausalya giving away money to people so delightfully today in charity,eventhough she is badly lured of money?"
2-7-6,"Why are people so happy today? Is the king duly pleased with something, doing anygreat act? Tell me."
2-7-7,"That housemaid, bursting with joy, told Manthara in a great gladdening tone aboutthe great honor to be conferred upon Rama."
2-7-8,"Tomorrow on the day of Pushyami star, king Dasaratha is going to anoint thefault-less Rama for the princely kingdom."
2-7-9,"After hearing the words of that maid, Manthara quickly with wrath walked down fromthe roof of the palace, which was in the shape of mount Kailasa."
2-7-10,"Manthara of sinful thought; burning with anger, approached Kaikeyi who was lying ona bed and spoke these words:"
2-7-11,"O, fool! Get up. Why are you sleeping? A dreadful situation is befalling you. Aflood of troubles submerges you. Why are you not knowing this yourself?"
2-7-12,"Oh, Kaikeyi ! You appear to be a beloved wife for your husband, but in reality hedoes not like you. You boast of your fortune. Like the flow of a stream in summer; your fortune isunsteady."
2-7-13,"Kaikeyi was very much worried after hearing hard words spoken with anger by Mantharaof sinful thoughts."
2-7-14,"Kaikeyi asked the hunch-backed Manthara as follows; ""O, Manthara! Are you not safe?You appear to be very sorrowful with your worried face""."
2-7-15,"After hearing Kaikeyi's sweet words, Manthara who was an expert in talking, spokewith anger."
2-7-16,"That Manthara, who was full of cunning, feigning to be seeking Kaikeyi's welfare,appeared more worried, and making Kaikeyi sorrowful, spoke the following, to create hostilitybetween Rama and Kaikeyi."
2-7-17,"Oh, queen! An unending great ruin has encircled you. King Dasaratha is going toanoint Rama for the princely kingdom."
2-7-18,"I am immersed in a bottomless pit of fear. I am in distress and my mind is burningas if by fire. I hastened here to seek you out."
2-7-19,"Kaikeyi! If Rama becomes king, his son will become king after him. Thus, Bharata'sname itself will be removed from the royal clan."
2-7-20,"Oh, Kaikeyi! Having born in a royal family and being an emperor's wife, how is itthat you are not knowing about the cruelty in kingly duties?"
2-7-21,"Your husband talks about righteousness, but does harm secretly. He says sweet wordsbut behaves cruelly. Because of your clean thinking; you are not able to know that he is cheatingyou thus."
2-7-22,"Your husband approaches you and talks good words, which are useless. But he passeson benefit today to Kausalya only."
2-7-23,"The evil minded Dasaratha sent Bharata to the house of his relatives and at dawn,is going to install Rama on the throne without hindrance."
2-7-24,"O, childish one! Like a mother, you wish for his well being. But he is an enemy,and is called husband for a namesake. He is like a poisonous serpent in your bosom."
2-7-25,"King Dasaratha has acted towards you and your son today in the same way as an enemyor a serpent would behave if ignored."
2-7-26,"O, stupid one! With his untruthful sweet words to you, who are ever deserving ofease, the evil minded king is installing Rama on the throne and is thus ruining you along with yourson."
2-7-27,"O, Kaikeyi, of amazing beauty! You have to take timely action immediately, so as tosave yourself, your son and me too."
2-7-28,"Hearing Manthara's words, that Kaikeyi of charming countenance who was lying in bed,rose from her coach full of delight like unto the crescent moon in autumn."
2-7-29,"That Kaikeyi in the midst of her astonishment and joy gave a graceful jewel to thehunch-backed Manthara."
2-7-30,"Kaikeyi, the best among women, gave a jewel to Manthara and spoke to her asfollows:"
2-7-31,"Oh, Manthara! You informed much gladdening news to me. What else can I do for you,who informed such a good news?"
2-7-32,"I do not see any difference between Rama and Bharata. That is why, I am happy thatRama is being anointed for crown by the king."
2-7-33,"O, Manthara! You do merit every favor. I have no other pleasant news than this.Hence, you cannot ever again inform a better loving news than this. I shall give you a good boon.Ask for it!"
2-8-1,"Manthara, becoming indignant with Kaikeyi, threw down the ornament given to her andwith anger and distress spoke the following words:"
2-8-2,"O, foolish one! Not knowing that you are in the midst of an ocean of trouble, whatis it that you are so delighted about, in a matter to be grieved?"
2-8-3,"Oh, queen! Though stricken with grief, I mentally laugh at you in that you arerejoicing at the time when a great calamity is befalling you."
2-8-4,"I am lamenting over your foolish mind. Does any intelligent woman feel happy overthe prosperity of a stepson who is considered an enemy? Does it not amount to praising a befallingdeath?"
2-8-5,"Rama has a fear about Bharata because Bharata has equal rights over the kingdom. Inthinking about this matter, I am getting anguished. Do we not get disasters from those who areafraid of us?"
2-8-6,"Lakshmana, wielding a great bow, joined Rama with all his heart. Shatrughna is asfaithful to Bharata as Lakshmana to Rama."
2-8-7,"Oh Kaikeyi! In line with even the proximity of birth; the claim to the throne ofBharata alone can be pressed, that of Lakshmana and Satrughna who are younger is out ofquestion."
2-8-8,"Rama is a learned man and a political statesman. His actions are timely andappropriate. When thinking of your son's calamity to be resulted from Rama, I get shaken withfear."
2-8-9,"Kausalya is very fortunate. Brahmans are going to anoint her son for the greatprincely kingdom tomorrow on the day of Pushyami star."
2-8-10,"With folded arms, as a maid-servant, you have to serve that Kausalya who havingreached great prosperity, in the height of joy, will dispose of her adversaries (in the person ofBharata and yourself)."
2-8-11,"Thus, if you become Kausalya's servant-maid along with us, your son Bharata will beRama's attendant."
2-8-12,"Rama's wives will get delighted. Your daughters-in-law will be unhappy because ofBharata's waning position."
2-8-13,"Hearing Manthara speak thus in many distasteful words, Kaikeyi began to extol Rama'svirtues, saying: -"
2-8-14,"Rama knows all righteousness. Elders trained him. He has a proper gratitude. Hespeaks truth. He has a clean conduct. He is the eldest son of king Dasaratha and hence eligible forthe kingdom."
2-8-15,"The long living Rama will protect his brothers and servants like a father. O, thehunch backed one! Why are you so pained on hearing about Rama's coronation?"
2-8-16,"After Rama's rule for one hundred years, Bharata the best among men will certainlyreplace Rama on his father's throne, which is that of his ancestors."
2-8-17,"Oh, Manthara! When we got an occasion for rejoicing as at present and when afestive occasion is to come off in future (too in the form of Bharata's installation, no mattereven if it comes after a hundred years), why do you feel agonized like this as though burning (withjealousy)?"
2-8-18,"For me, Rama is as lovable as Bharata and even more. Is he not doing more serviceto me than to Kausalya?"
2-8-19,"If Rama has kingdom then Bharata has it as well. Rama esteems his brothers just ashis own self."
2-8-20,"Manthara, after hearing Kaikeyi's words, felt very sad and after a long and hotsigh, spoke to her the following words:"
2-8-21,"On one side, you are getting immersed in an ocean of sorrow filled with misery anddanger. But due to stupidity, you are not able to perceive the truth and you fail to assess yourreal position."
2-8-22,"O,Kaikeyi! If Rama becomes the king, his son will become the king after him insuccession. Thus, Bharata's name itself will be removed from the royal clan."
2-8-23,"O, Kaikeyi! All the sons of a king will not be crowned for a kingdom. If all areinstalled, there will be a great lawlessness."
2-8-24,"Therefore, kings, O, Kaikeyi of faultless limbs, install their eldest son,eventhough others may be full of virtues, as their successor to the throne."
2-8-25,"Oh, Kaikeyi the affectionate one! Your son will be completely distant from comfortsand even from the royal clan; like an orphan."
2-8-26,"I came here in your interests. But you have not understood me. You think it fit togive me a present when your step-wife is getting prospered."
2-8-27,"Rama, ascending the throne without hindrance, will either send away Bharata to someother country or have him put to death. This is certain."
2-8-28,"You sent Bharata to his maternal uncle's house even in his childhood. By beingnearer, love is born even on inanimate objects. By sending Bharata to a distant place, you madeDasaratha to have no affection towards him."
2-8-29,"Shatrughna was drawn towards Bharata and went along with him. Just as Lakshmanajoined Rama, Shatrughna joined Bharata."
2-8-30,"We hear that a tree marked down for felling by foresters, when covered by thornyIshhiika grass, is saved from this great danger of cutting. So also, Dasaratha might have supportedBharata if he was staying near to him in Ayodhya."
2-8-31,"Lakshmana protects Rama. Rama protects Lakshmana. Their brotherly love is as famousas that of Aswini celestials."
2-8-32,"Hence, Rama will not do a sinful act of killing Lakshmana. However there is nodoubt that he will do so in the case of Bharata."
2-8-33,"Hence, I feel that it is better for your son to go to forest directly from hisuncle's house. This is good for you too."
2-8-34,"If Bharata gets his father's kingdom as per law, it will be beneficial to you andyour side of relatives."
2-8-35,"Your youthful son, habituated to comforts, is a natural enemy to Rama. How canBharata who failed to achieve his purpose live under control of Rama; whose flourishing object hasbeen realised?"
2-8-36,"Rama is chasing and bringing down Bharata as a lion chases an elephant-king inforest. You ought to protect Bharata."
2-8-37,"Previously, you treated Kausalya with disrespect due to arrogance that you werefortunate. Will not such Kausalya, your rival wife, revenge for that animosity?"
2-8-38,"O, Kaikeyi! The day Rama becomes lord of this earth with its great oceans,mountains and towns; that day you and your Bharata will get a bad and pitiable position ofignominy."
2-8-39,"When Rama gets power of the kingdom Bharata will certainly get ruined. Hence, thinkof a solution to get your son Bharata the kingdom and to send Rama, your enemy, to exile."
2-9-1,"After hearing those words, Kaikeyi with her face burning with anger, had a long andhot sigh and spoke to Manthara as follows:"
2-9-2,"Now itself, I shall send Rama quickly to forest. I shall get Bharata anointed forprincely kingdom immediately."
2-9-3,"O Manthara! What is the means by which Bharata will get the kingdom but Rama willnot get it by any method. Think about it now."
2-9-4,"After hearing her words, the sinful thinking Manthara, spoke thus to Kaikeyi todestroy Rama's benefit of kingdom."
2-9-5,"O Kaikeyi! I am very glad. I shall tell you the means by which your son Bharataonly will get the kingdom. Listen to it!"
2-9-6,"Oh, Kaikeyi! You desire to hear from me the means for your benefit. Have youforgotten about it or are you hiding, even if you have remembered it?"
2-9-7,"O the lady of charms, Kaikeyi! If you desire to hear this from my mouth, I shalltell you. Listen to me. Let it be acted upon after listening to me."
2-9-8,"After hearing Manthara's words, Kaikeyi slightly rose from the well-laid bed andspoke the following :"
2-9-9,"O Manthara! Tell me the trick by which Bharata will get the kingdom and Rama willnot get it under any circumstances."
2-9-10,"After hearing Kaikeyi's words, the sinful thinking, hunch backed Manthara, spokethus, with an intention to destroy Rama's benefit of kingdom."
2-9-11,"O Queen! Once upon a time, when there was a battle between celestials and demons,your husband Dasaratha went along with you and other holy kings to help Indra in battle, to afamous city called Vaijayata in which the demon Timidhvaja lived in a southern direction in theforest of Dandaka."
2-9-12,"That great demon famously called shambara, who had several magic effects, defeatedall the celestials and conferred battle upon Devendra."
2-9-13,"In that great battle, demons approached and forcefully killed men who were injuredby arrows and also those who were sleeping at night."
2-9-14,"Then, king Dasaratha fought a great battle there. With their weapons, demons madeinto pieces the long armed Dasaratha."
2-9-15,"O Queen! You saved the life of your unconscious husband by taking him away from thebattle field. There also, you again saved him, when beaten by demons with their weapons."
2-9-16,"O Kaikeyi with auspicious appearance! Getting delighted, he gave two boons to you.Then, you said,  I shall ask you whenever I require them"". He then agreed to it."""
2-9-17,"O Queen! I do not know what had happened there. You yourself told this storypreviously to me. I am keeping this in my mind because of my friendship with you. Hence, you haveto stop, by force, the arrangements being made for Rama's coronation."
2-9-18,"You ask your husband as two boons, anointing Bharata for princely kingdom andsending Rama to exile for fourteen years."
2-9-19,"If you send Rama to forest for fourteen years, your son Bharata will get intimateassociation in the hearts of the people and will get stabilised in kingdom."
2-9-20,"Oh, kaikeyi! Now, enter the room of wrath as if angry with him and lie down on floorwithout any spread underneath and wearing soiled clothes."
2-9-21,"As soon as you see Dasaratha, be sorrowful and keep on weeping, without looking athim and without talking to him face to face."
2-9-22,"You are always dear to your husband. I have no doubt about it. King Dasaratha willeven jump into a fire for your sake."
2-9-23,"The king is not capable of making you angry. He is not even able to see you withanger. He will give up his life for your love."
2-9-24,"Oh, foolish one! The king will not be able to transgress your word. You realise yourabundant strength."
2-9-25,"King Dasaratha may offer you diamonds, pearls, gold and various other preciousstones. Do not care for them."
2-9-26,"Oh, Kaikeyi, the great fortunate! you remind Dasaratha of those boons given by himto you in that battle between celestials and demons. See that your benefit does not getthwarted."
2-9-27,"Dasaratha himself will raise you from the floor and offer you the boon. Thus , aftermaking him steady, you ask for this boon."
2-9-28,"Oh, king! send Rama to forest for fourteen years. Let Bharata be made as king ofthis earth."
2-9-29,"Rama having been sent to forest for fourteen years, your son will stand firmly,having laid his roots and will stay in power for the remaining period."
2-9-30,"Oh, Kaikeyi! Ask Dasaratha of sending Rama to forest also as a boon. Thus, your sonwill accomplish all the desired benefits."
2-9-31,"Thus , by sending Rama to exile, he will not become amiable to people. Your Bharatawill become king, after the enemies having been annihilated."
2-9-32,"When Rama returns from forest, your wise son will accumulate friends and draw peopleto his fold, thus establishing roots himself."
2-9-33,"This is the appropriate time for you. Be fearless and by your insistence, make theking turn aside his effort to anoint Rama."
2-9-34,"Kaikeyi, being brain-washed an unworthy matter as the most worthy matter byManthara, accepted her well and having delighted, spoke to her as follows:-"
2-9-35,"Though of right thinking in nature, Kaikeyi was very much surprised to hearManthara's words and like a small girl, got into a wrong path."
2-9-36,"Oh, Manthara! You are telling very good things. Till now, I have not recognised youas this good. You are the best among the hunch-backed on this earth in making intellectualdecisions."
2-9-37,"Oh, Manthara! you always show interest in my well being and wish for my benefit. Butfor you, I would not have been aware of the king's intentions."
2-9-38,"There are so many hunch backed persons in the world. Their bodily construction isvery bad. They are crooked and dreadful. But you appear lovely, as a lotus flower bent bybreeze."
2-9-39,"Your chest is appearing equally on both sides and is loftily extended unto theshoulder. Below it is the stomach with an excellent navel, which is lean as though it is shy ofseeing the loftiness of chest."
2-9-40,"Oh, Manthara! with perfect hips and well rounded breasts and with your face like anuntainted moon you are shining well."
2-9-41,"Oh, Manthara! your waist decorated with golden belt is making sound. Yourleg-muscles are well rounded and your feet are tall."
2-9-42,"Oh, Manthara! you are splendid like a royal swan walking before me, with long thighsare wearing a silk sari."
2-9-43,"In addition to all those thousand magic effects lying in shambara, the lord ofdemons, another further thousands of magic effects are lying in you."
2-9-44,"In your long hunch, which looks like an apex of a chariot, are dwelling your variousthoughts, royal arts and magic effects."
2-9-45,"Oh Manthara! When Rama goes to forest and Bharata gets kingdom, I shall adore thishunch back with a golden garland."
2-9-46,"Oh, Manthara! After accomplishing the benefit desired by me, I shall, with delight,get your hunch back anointed with well refined gold of good quality."
2-9-47,"Oh, Manthara! I shall get beautiful ornaments made and for your forehead auspiciousdots of variety done of pure gold."
2-9-48,"You will be moving around like an angel, wearing beautiful clothes. You will achievean important position in the eyes of your adversaries with pride and with your face, incomparablycompeting with moon."
2-9-49,"The hunch backed women, adorned with all ornaments, will always do service, at yourfeet, as how as hunch-backed women, adorned with all ornaments, will always do service at yourfeet, as how as hunch-backed you are doing it to me."
2-9-50,"Manthara in this way being praised spoke these words to Kaikeyi, who was lying in aclean couch like a flame of fire upon the sacrificial altar."
2-9-51,"Oh, Kaikeyi the auspicious one! When water has already flown out, there is no useconstructing a dam. Now rise and do this purposeful action. Show your influence to the king."
2-9-52,"By surrendering to the words of Manthara and having been thus encouraged by her,Kaikeyi who was of wide eyes, who was proud of her intoxicating beauty, who was a gifted woman anda queen, removed pearl necklace worth in lacs and other great valuable auspicious ornaments fromher body, entered the chamber of wrath along with Manthara, lied on the floor there like a goldenwire and spoke to Manthara as follows:"
2-9-53,"After Rama's going to the forest, Bharata shall get the kingdom. Or else, youinform the king that I died here itself."
2-9-54,"Neither gold nor diamonds nor ornaments are of any use to me. on which day Rama getsanointed for the kingdom, the same day it will be the end of my life."
2-9-55,"Afterwards, that Manthara again spoke to the seriously talking mother of Bharatathat is Kaikeyi the following words which were beneficial to her and not beneficial in relation toRama."
2-9-56,"If Rama becomes king, you and your son will be destroyed. Oh, Kaikeyi of auspiciousqualities! Hence you try for coronation of your son, Bharata"
2-9-57,"Having thus hit by arrows of words employed by Manthara again and again, Kaikeyifelt sad, was angry with the king, by keeping hands on her heart, was surprised with the clevernessof Manthara and praised her time and again."
2-9-58,"If Rama does not go to forest from here, I do not long for any mattresses orgarlands or sandal paste or eye-liner or drink or food or even the loaf here."
2-9-59,"If Rama does not go to forest from here, I do not long for any mattresses orgarlands or sandal paste or eye-liner or drink or food or even the life here."
2-9-60,"Kaikeyi, thus uttering cruel words, having removed all ornaments, lied on the floorwithout a mattress like a fallen angel."
2-9-61,"Kaikeyi, having removed all adornments, having her face covered by the darkness ofextreme anger and with her depressed mind, looked like a starless sky in a gloomy night."
2-10-1,"Having been thus wrongly preached by that sinful Manthara. Kaikeyi lied down on thefloor as a Kinnara woman beaten by a poisoned arrow."
2-10-2,"The skilful Kaikeyi, after deciding in mind what ought to be done told it all slowlyto Manthara."
2-10-3,"Being stupefied by the words of Manthara, that Kaikeyi became dejected, made firmresolve, with deep and warm sigh, like a maiden-serpent and thought for that moment about the wayswhich can lead to her happiness."
2-10-4,"Manthara, who is Kaikeyi's companion and who is desirous of getting benefit, heardof Kaikeyi's firm resolve and became very much pleased as if she achieved success."
2-10-5,"Kaikeyi, being angry and well determined, lied down on the floor with eye brows,knitted in her face."
2-10-6,"Thereafter, she threw away her colourful chaplets and beautiful ornaments on to thefloor."
2-10-7,"Those chaplets and ornaments which were thrown away by her were making the earthshine, as stars to the sky."
2-10-8,"Tying her single braid of hair tightly over her head and wearing soiled clothes,that Kaikeyi lying down in the chamber of wrath was looking like a Kinnara woman lying downdead."
2-10-9,"King Dasaratha ordered for various arrangements to be made for Rama's coronation,took permission to leave from the elders who were present there and entered his palace."
2-10-10,"king Dasaratha, who kept all activates under his control entered into the innerchambers to tell the good news of Rama's coronation to Kaikeyi who was a worthy woman to be toldthe good news first (thinking that she has not yet heard the news)."
2-10-11,"That Dasaratha with vast glory entered Kaikeyi's chambers as moon enters the skywith white clouds."
2-10-12,"King Dasaratha entered his magnificent palace but could not find his beloved kaikeyion her best couch there. Peacocks and parrots were being reared in that palace, sounds of birdslike curlews, and swans were heard around. The place was resonant with sounds of musicalinstruments. Short and hunch-backed maid-servants were moving here and there. There were bowerssurrounded with creepers and lovely champaka and Ashoka trees. There were painted rooms. There werealtars built with ivory, silver and gold. There were trees yielding flowers and fruits in allseasons and wells in the middle. There were beautiful seats constructed with ivory, silver andgold. Various types of food, drinks and snacks were made available. That palace was looking likeheaven with beautifully adorned women."
2-10-13,"Being possessed of power of lust, that king who came with object of sexual pleasure,was distressed in not finding his beloved wife and enquired the people there."
2-10-14,"In former times, Kaikeyi did not keep away herself at that kind of hour, nor theking enter her chambers at any time without her presence."
2-10-15,"After entering the house, king Dasaratha enquired with the aid-servants there asbefore, without knowing about foolish Kaikeyi who desired to get her selfish ends."
2-10-16,"Then, a female door-keeper fearfully folding her hands in supplication, said: ""Oh,king! The queen ran to her chamber of wrath with much anger""."
2-10-17,"That Dasaratha having much disturbed mind already for the absence of Kaikeyi there,became more dejected after hearing the words of door-keeper."
2-10-18,"King Dasaratha, after seeing Kaikeyi lying down on floor in the chamber of wrath,became tormented with grief."
2-10-19,"That Dasaratha, who was sinless, a youthful woman dearer than his life, lying downon the floor with an intent to do sin. At that time, she was looking like a completely uprootedcreeper, like a fallen angel, like a thrown down Kinnara woman, like an expelled divine dancerApsarasa, like a dropped off illusionism and like a female deer tied up in a net."
2-10-20,"That Dasaratha touched Kaikeyi affectionately, as a great elephant in a foresttouches a female elephant which is wounded by poisoned arrow."
2-10-21,"That Dasaratha, possessed with infatuation and having fearful mind, touched thatlotus-eyed woman with his hands and spoke the following words."
2-10-22,"Oh queen, of auspicious qualities! I do not know that you are angry with me. Whohas cursed or disrespected you? I am pained to see you resting in this way on a dirty floor."
2-10-23,"when I am here to expend all good to you, why are you hurting my mind by lying downon the floor like the one who is possessed of a devil."
2-10-24,"There are so many royal physicians who are skilled and famous on all sides. Theycan make you healthy. Tell me your sickness."
2-10-25,"To whom do you want a favour to be done? who has offended you? Tell me to whom Ihave to extend a favour now and to whom I have to do a great offensive act."
2-10-26,"Oh, Kaikeyi! Do not weep and get your body dried up. If you tell, I shall kill aperson who is exempt from death or shall release a person who is worthy to be killed. I shall makea poor man prosperous or a rich man, destitute."
2-10-27,"I and all my people are submissive to you. I do not wish to foil even a little ofyour intention."
2-10-28,"Tell me that which is desired by your mind to be achieved even at the cost of mylife. You need not suspect me, as you very well know your authority over me. I keep my oath on myrighteousness that I shall certainly do whatever is liked by you."
2-10-29,"My jurisdiction over this earth stretches out as much to the extent as to the extenta chariot-wheel revolves. Eastern countries, Sindhu, Sauviira and Saurastra countries, as well ascountries in the south, Vanga, Anga, Magadha and Matsya countries, Kasi and Kausala countries areall full of riches."
2-10-30,"In those countries, gold and grain, sheep and goats and all types of goods areproduced. Oh, Kaikeyi! which of the goods do you want to acquire?"
2-10-31,"Oh, fearful one! why are you exerted like this? oh, beautiful lady? Get up get up!Oh, Kaikeyi1 Tell me the source of your fear. I shall remove that source as sun sets aside themist."
2-10-32,"Consoled by hearing the words of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi intending to tell unkindly wordslike Rama's exile was beginning to harass her husband further, by her words."
2-11-1,"Kaikeyi spoke harsh words to that king, who was struck by cupid's arrows and yieldedto hasty lust."
2-11-2,"Oh, King! no body has insulted me, nor despised me. But I have a certain, desirethat needs to be fulfilled by you."
2-11-3,"If you wish to fulfil my desire, you promise to fulfil it. After your promise Ishall inform you that which is desired by me."
2-11-4,"The most majestic and lustful Dasaratha smiled a little and caressingly kept hishand into her hair and spoke these words to Kaikeyi who was having white smile in her face."
2-11-5,"Oh, proud woman! Don't you know that there is nobody on this earth more dearer tome than you except Rama, the best among men."
2-11-6,"Rama cannot be defeated by enemies. He is a very important person in our family. Heis the supporter of life and a high souled man. I take oath by him. Tell me what is desired byyou."
2-11-7,"Oh, Kaikeyi ! I can't live even for a moment without seeing Rama. This is certain.By that Rama, I am taking my oath and promising to fulfill your word."
2-11-8,"I desire the well being of Rama, the best of men, even at the cost of my life orthe lives of my other sons. I take oath by that Rama and tell you that I shall fulfil yourword."
2-11-9,"Oh, auspicious lady! My heart is sinking. You raise it by your touch. Oh, Kaikeyi!you observe all this and tell me that which you think as good."
2-11-10,"You need not doubt me as you know your authority over me. I am taking oath on myauspiciousness. I shall do whatever is desired by you."
2-11-11,"That Kaikeyi, who has utmost desire for coronation of Bharata and for sending Ramato exile, revealing that wish from her mind, uttered unspeakable wordswith bias and delight."
2-11-12,"Kaikeyi, having been delighted with Dasaratha's words, conveyed him of the veryhorrible wish in her mind as conveying the news of a suddenly befallen death."
2-11-13,"Let thirty three celestials with the god of Fire in the forefront hear your wordsgiving boons to me, preceded by series of your oaths"
2-11-14,"Let your words be heard by sun, moon, sky, planets, day, night, the directions,universe, earth, celestial musicians, demons, spirits wandering in nights , house-gods and otherspirits."
2-11-15,"King Dasaratha, who has true promise, who has great valour, who knows righteousnessand who has good equanimity of mind, is giving boon to me. Let the celestials hear it for mysake."
2-11-16,"Kaikeyi made Dasaratha to hear these words, praised him too much and thereafterspoke these words to him who was ready to give boons as he was infatuated by lust."
2-11-17,"Oh, King! Remember what happened in the battle between celestials and demons in theolden times. There the enemy destroyed almost every thing except your life."
2-11-18,"Oh, King! There, I saved you. Hence you gave boon to myself who was attentive intrying to save you."
2-11-19,"Oh, King! The protection of the Earth, the one who has true promise! I am huntingfor those boons, which were given by you and kept with you for safe custody."
2-11-20,"You have to give that boon, as per right, to me as promised by you. If you despiseme by not giving it, I should abandon my life now itself."
2-11-21,"Dasaratha, after having thus yielded in full measure to kaikeyi's words, fell intoher trap as a deer, for his self destruction."
2-11-22,"There-afterwards, Kaikeyi spoke these words to Dasaratha who was ready to give boonsand who was infatuated by lust: ""Oh, King! the lord of Earth, now only I am asking for those boonswhich were given by you then. Listen to my words""."
2-11-23,"All arrangements have been made to undertake Rama's coronation. Let my Bharatainstead be coronated on this occasion itself."
2-11-24,"Now, the time has arrived for the second boon given by you affectionately then inthe battle between celestials and demons."
2-11-25,"Rama has to take refuge in the forest of Dandaka for fourteen years and let himbecome an ascetic wearing rags, deer skin and matted hair."
2-11-26,"Now itself, Bharata has to get rights of succession to kingdom, which is free ofenemies. This is my greatest desire. Now I am asking for the boon given by you in earlier. "
2-11-27,"Oh King of the Kings, Dasaratha ! Be true to your promise and protect your caste,character and birth. Are not the ascetics tell that for human beings to get happiness in anotherworld, they have to speak only the truth."
2-12-1,"After hearing the cruel words of Kaikeyi; King Dasaratha got disturbed and suffered great agony for a while."
2-12-2,"As it a day-dream or confusion of my mind? Or could it be an eclipse of my experience or a disease of the mind?"
2-12-3,"Thinking over thus, the king could not make out on the spur of the moment what it was. Then, regaining consciousness, he felt tormented by Kaikeyi&#39;s words. Distressed and disgusted as a deer at the sight of a lioness and seated on the bare floor, he gave forth a long sigh like a highly venomous serpent fixed to a charmed spot through magic spells. Uttering words what a pity! the angry king fell into a swoon once more, his mind infatuated with grief."
2-12-4,"Regaining consciousness after a long time and feeling much distressed and angry; the King spoke thus to Kaikeyi, as though consuming her with fire in his eyes"
2-12-5,"Oh cruel woman of wicked conduct inclined to exterminate this race! What wrong has been done to you by Rama or by me?"
2-12-6,"When Rama is treating you in the same way as his mother, why are you bent upon harming only him?"
2-12-7,"By not knowing you as a female snake with fiery poison, you were admitted by me as princess in my house for my own self destruction."
2-12-8,"When all living beings extol the virtues of Rama, for what offence shall I forego my beloved son?"
2-12-9,"For what offence shall I forsake my beloved son; when the entire world of living beings extol the virtues of Rama?"
2-12-10,"Supreme delight comes to me on seeing my eldest son. My very consciousness is lost, if I fail to see Rama."
2-12-11,"The world can exist without the sun, a crop without water. But life cannot continue in my body, without Rama."
2-12-12,"Oh, sinful woman! Enough of it. Let this resolution be given up. I even touch your feet with my head. Be gracious to me."
2-12-13,"Oh, sinful woman! Why this most design has been conceived by you? If you wish to ascertain my kindly or unkindly feeling towards Bharata, let it be so. But the observation made by you earlier that glorious Rama, who is senior in the practice of virtue is my eldest son as it were, must have been uttered in order to coax me or to get service from him."
2-12-14,"Afflicted with grief by hearing Rama&#39;s proposed installation; you are tormenting me too much. Possessed by an evil spirit in a lonely house; you are subject to control of another"
2-12-15,"Oh, queen! In this Ikshhvaaku race, which is rich in good conduct, this very great misfortune has appeared, due to which your mind has been perverted"
2-12-16,"Oh, large eyed one! Earlier you have not done anything unreasonable or repugnant to me. That is why; I do not believe what has been done by you."
2-12-17,"Indeed, Rama is on par with the great souled Bharata to you, for many times you were telling me stories illustrating this, Oh, young lady!"
2-12-18,"Oh, timid lady! How do you take delight in banishment for fourteen years of that pious-minded and illustrious Rama?"
2-12-19,"How do you take delight in the sojourn, in a most dreadful forest; of Rama with very delicate body and having his self held in piety?"
2-12-20,"Oh, the fair-eyed one! Why do you take delight in banishment of Rama, who is so pleasing to look at and who is so obediently doing service to you?"
2-12-21,"Rama always is doing service to you more than Bharata does. For that reason also, in your case, I do not see any speciality in Bharata."
2-12-22,"In fact, who else other than Rama the best of men could do much more service to you with respect, with correct notion and in obedience?"
2-12-23,"No censure or calumny against Rama can come from the mouth of many of thousands of women or from numerous dependents maintained by me. Addressing gently all created beings with clear mind, Rama a tiger among men, captivates the people of his kingdom by his kind actions."
2-12-24,"Rama the valiant, conquers men by virtue, the poor through charity, the elders by service, the enemies in battle by his bow."
2-12-25,"Truthfulness, charity, austerity, sacrifice, purity, straight forwardness, learning, service to elders-these firmly established in Rama."
2-12-26,"Oh, Queen! How do you wish harm to that Rama who is richly endowed with honesty, who is equal to god and who is having splendour as of a great sage?"
2-12-27,"I do not remember an unkind word spoken by Rama, who always speaks kindly words to all. As such, how can I for your sake, break unpalatable news to Rama the beloved."
2-12-28,"What recourse is there for me other than Rama, in whom forgiveness, asceticism, self-denial, truthfulness, piety, gratitude and harmlessness towards living beings exist."
2-12-29,"Oh, Kaikeyi! You ought to bestow mercy to me, and old and miserable man who reached his end and is coaxing painfully to you"
2-12-30,"Whatever can be attained on earth, which has the sea an end, all that I can give you. Let not anger take possession of you"
2-12-31,"Oh, Kaikeyi! I fold my hands in salutation to you. I am even touching your feet. Be a protector of Rama. Let not unrighteousness lay hold on me in this matter."
2-12-32,"The fierce Kaikeyi again spoke these fiercer words to Dasaratha, who was burning with sorrow and was wailing as aforesaid, who had fallen unconscious and was tossing about as he was filled with grief, and was praying again and again for being speedily borne across the sea of grief."
2-12-33,"Oh, Valiant king! Having again boons, if you repent again and again how can you proclaim piety on this earth?"
2-12-34,"Oh, knower of what is right! When many royal saints assemble and converse with you, what will be your reply?"
2-12-35,"Can you say a wrong was done to Kaikeyi, on whose grace I am living now and who protected me earlier?"
2-12-36,"Oh, King! You having granted boons indeed today, now talk in another way, creating blemish on other kings"
2-12-37,"When there was a dispute between a hawk and a pigeon (who were no other than Indra the ruler of gods and the god of fire respectively), the ruler of Sibis* gave away his own flesh to the bird and king Alarka* by parting with his eyes, attained to the highest destiny."
2-12-38,"The ocean, having given a promise, never crosses its limits. Therefore, bearing in mind the previous occurrences do not violate the pledge given by you to me."
2-12-39,"Oh, the evil-minded! By giving up righteousness and by installing Rama in the kingdom, you want to enjoy life with Kausalya forever."
2-12-40,"Let it be unrighteous or righteous, real or hoax. There should be no change in whatever is promised by you for me."
2-12-41,"If Rama is coroneted, I shall indeed die before your eyes by drinking abundant poison now itself in front of you."
2-12-42,"If I have to see Kausalya, the mother of Rama receiving salutations even for day, death is indeed better for me."
2-12-43,"Oh, King! I swear to you an oath by Bharata and by myself that I will not be pleased with anything else other than sending Rama to exile."
2-12-44,"Kaikeyi spoke words of such extent and stopped. She did not further reply to the wailing."
2-12-45,"Hearing Kaikeyi&#39;s boons, asking for Rama&#39;s exile and Bharata&#39;s sovereignty which are very much unwelcome, king Dasaratha nevertheless was perturbed for a while and did not move his lips towards Kaikeyi."
2-12-46,"He kept gazing with unwinking eyes towards his beloved queen Kaikeyi, who spoke such disagreeable words. The king could not become comfortable on hearing that utterance, which was unkindly to his heart filling with pain and sorrow and was as terrible as a thunderbolt."
2-12-47,"Reflecting over Kaikeyi&#39;s resolve and her terrible swearing, Dasaratha heaved a sigh, uttering Rama and fell like tree which was cut off."
2-12-48,"Then the king become like mental a mad man who lost his equilibrium like an ailing man getting upset and like a serpent losing it&#39;s fierceness."
2-12-49,"The king spoke to Kaikeyi in a distressed tone as follows By whom have you been taught this worthless thing which appears to be worthwhile? Like a woman whose mind has been perverted by an evil spirit; you are not ashamed to speak to me."
2-12-50,"In the beginning, I was not knowing your wavery conduct in this way. But now, I am seeing it in you. It is perverted."
2-12-51,"From whom has such fear cropped up in you, so as to seek Bharata to be seated on the throne and Rama to stay in the forest?"
2-12-52,"If you want to do favour to your husband, to the world at large and to Bharata, you give up this sinful intention of sending Rama to exile."
2-12-53,"Oh, cruel! Petty minded woman of sinful resolve and wicked deed! Which grievance or offence are you finding in me or in Rama?"
2-12-54,"With out Rama, Bharata will not in any case take possession of the kingdom of Ayodhya as I think him to be stronger in virtue than even Rama."
2-12-55,"Having uttered the words &#39;proceed to the forest!&#39; How can I behold the pale face of Rama resembling an eclipsed moon?"
2-12-56,"How can I see that reasonable view of mine, which was well made in consultation with friends and decided, being foiled like an army destroyed by enemies? What the kings who came from many directions, will speak about me? &#39;Alas&#39;, this king Dasaratha, a fool was ruling this kingdom for such a long time!"
2-12-57,"When many virtuous and learned elders enquire me about Rama, what then shall I tell them?"
2-12-58,"Even if I tell the truth that Rama was sent to forest by me, hard-pressed as I was by Kaikeyi, nobody will believe it and think as untruth."
2-12-59,"What will Kausalya say to me if Rama proceeds to forest? What can I, having done an unkind act, reply to her?"
2-12-60,"Oh, Kaikeyi! Whatever Kausalya, who was always desirous of showing kindness to me, who was blessed with a pet son, who speaks kind words and who deserves to be kindly treated, was waiting on me like a maid-servant, like a friend, like a wife, like a sister and like a mother. But, for your sake, she was never treated kindly by me."
2-12-61,"That which was done good be me for you, is hurting me now even as a meal taken with forbidden sauces fills an ailing person with repentance."
2-12-62,"Being apprehensive of seeing Rama being treated with contempt and his exile to the forest, how will Sumitra put faith in me?"
2-12-63,"Seetha, alas, will hear woefully two unpleasant, of me having befallen to death and of Rama seeking refuge in the forest."
2-12-64,"Alas! Like a Kinnara girl bereft of her partner at the side of Himalayan hill, Seetha with her grief will make me lose my life."
2-12-65,"Seeing Rama dwelling in a great forest and Seetha lamenting, I cannot indeed desire to line."
2-12-66,"Oh, Kaikeyi! Deprived of your husband, you can as such rule the kingdom along with your son. It is indeed impossible for me to survive, after Rama&#39;s exile"
2-12-67,"I considered you, a good and virtuous wife as you are, proving to be perpetually bad wife, as one, having drunk wine with poison, though possessing an attractive appearance, concludes it to be obnoxious."
2-12-68,"You used to speak to me very consolingly with untruthful gentle words like a deer being killed by a hunter after enticing it with melodious sounds."
2-12-69,"Venerable people gathered in the streets will reproach me who has sold away my son, saying that I am as bad as a brahmana who drinks wine. It is certain."
2-12-70,"Alas! How was distressing and how painful it is that I have to forbear your words! I got this type of trouble as an evil consequence earned in a previous life."
2-12-71,"Like a rope used for hanging up one&#39;s neck through ignorance; Oh sinful woman; you have been lovingly maintained by me, sinful as I am"
2-12-72,"Enjoying life with you, I could not recognise you as death. I touched you, like cobra touched with hand by a child in a deserted place."
2-12-73,"This world of living beings is certainly fit to curse me, such as I am; saying that Rama the great souled is deprived of fatherly protection by me, the evil-minded."
2-12-74,"Alas! Extremely foolish is king Dasaratha; whose mind is lustful for a woman and sent his son to the forest."
2-12-75,"Emaciated by vow&#39;s, by study of Vedas and by service to his preceptors, Rama will indeed during the period of enjoyment, again undergo a great hardship."
2-12-76,"My son Rama is incapable of saying a second word to me to go to forest, he will say Be it so."
2-12-77,"If Rama does contrary to my command to go to forest, it will be most welcome to me. But, Rama the darling would never do so."
2-12-78,"Rama, who is pure minded; cannot indeed conjecture my way of thinking. Having been told to go to the forest, he will say Be it so."
2-12-79,"On Rama reaching the forest, Death will take me, who is condemned by all men and unpardonable, to the abode of Yama the god of punishment."
2-12-80,"Rama the foremost among men-having left for the forest and I having been dead, what sinful act can you think of the remaining people beloved of me."
2-12-81,"The queen Kausalya, after losing me, Rama and sons Lakshmana and satrughna, will be enable to endure the woes and will follow me to the abode of Yama."
2-12-82,"Having thrown Kausalya, Sumitra along with three sons and myself into tortures of hell, you be happy!."
2-12-83,"Being abandoned by me and Rama, the Ikshhvaaku dynasty which was eternal, which was adorned with qualities, which could not be disturbed, will now be protected by you by bringing disorder."
2-12-84,"If it becomes agreeable to Bharata to send Rama to exile, let not Bharata do funeral rite to me, when life has departed."
2-12-85,"Alas! My adversary! Oh, vulgar lady, Kaikeyi! Become satisfied with your desires! When I am dead consequent on Rama, the foremost of men, having proceeded to forest, you a widow along with your son will then rule over the kingdom."
2-12-86,"You are residing in my house with the designation of a princess. All fame, which is unequalled in this world and lasting insult as well as disrespect of men will fall to my share as to a perpetrator of sins."
2-12-87,"How can my beloved son Rama, who was hitherto travelling as a Lord time again in chariots elephants and horses, will move on foot in a great forest?"
2-12-88,"How will my sin; in whose dining time; cooks wearing ear-rings used to prepare excellent food and drinks trying to finish their work before others actually survive by eating astringent bitter and pungent wild foods?"
2-12-89,"How having worn costly robes, will Rama who is deserving of lasting comforts, be in brown-red clothing on this earth?"
2-12-90,"Whose terrific and thoughtless words are these of one demanding Rama&#39;s exile to forest and the other of Bharata&#39;s consecration as king?"
2-12-91,"Women of course are deceivers, even occupied with selfishness. Let them be condemned! Here, I am not mentioning of all women but of Bharata&#39;s mother only."
2-12-92,"Oh, cruel woman of evil intent; given to pursuit of your selfish ends, you have a settled disposition to bring grief to me. What a mischief do you expect through me or through Rama, who is always doing benefit to you?"
2-12-93,"On seeing Rama plunged in adversity fathers leave of their sons and wives too their husbands. Not, even the entire world gets exasperated."
2-12-94,"I, for one, rejoice by seeing that son Rama in the form of a divine boy, adorned with ornaments coming in proximity to me. By seeing him again and again, I get rejuvenated."
2-12-95,"Active life may not be possible even without sun or even Indra (the wielder of thunder bolt) not pouring rain. But, my opinion is that not even one will survive, by seeing Rama departing from here."
2-12-96,"I lodged in my house, as one would one&#39;s own mortal enemy, you, who seek my destruction and are unfriendly. Alas, due to ignorance, a highly venomous female serpent has been held on my lap so long and therefore I am undone."
2-12-97,"Bereft of me as also Rama and Lakshmana, let Bharata along with you, rule over the city and the state. After killing your relatives, bring delight to my enemies."
2-12-98,"Oh, cruel natured! One who has struck a blow in adversity! When you violently utter such words now, why the teeth from your mouth have not fallen down, breaking into thousands of pieces?"
2-12-99,"Rama does not speak a word which is even a little malevolent or unkindly. He does not know how to utter harsh words. How indeed are you recounting the faults of Rama, who talks beautifully and who is always admired for his virtues"
2-12-100,"Oh, Kaikeyi, the black guard of Keka dynasty! You may faint away or flare up or perish or enter the earth split up into thousands of cracks! I will not act on your word which is very cruel and inimical to me."
2-12-101,"I do not wish the survival of you, who are destructive like a razor, always speaking falsely pleasing words, are of evil natured, disastrous to the family, intent upon burning my heart along with vitals and repellent to my mind."
2-12-102,"There is no life to me without my son. How can there be happiness moreover? From whom else can there be joy, while I survive? Oh, queen! You ought not to do an unfriendly act to me. I even touch your feet. Be gracious to me."
2-12-103,"That king, who has been gripped in the heart his by his wife, who transgressed all bounds of decorum, he wailing like a forlorn child and not reaching Kaikeyi&#39;s both the feet which were spread along, sank down like an ailing man."
2-13-1,"Dasaratha was not suitable for such an unfortunate condition nor was he habituatedto such a situation. He was lying down on the floor, as king Yayati who fell down on earth fterexhausting his merit in the region of heaven. Kaikeyi who was a manifestation of worthlessness whoaccomplished her desire, who was fearlessly exhibiting her fearful form, asked for those boonsagain in a loud voice, to Dasaratha who was in such a bad mood situation."
2-13-2,"Oh, king! You always boast yourself, saying I speak truth. I am persisted in mypromise."" Now, why are you objecting to my boon?"""
2-13-3,"After thus spoken to by Kaikeyi, Dasaratha became angry, turned out delirious for amoment and again spoke as follows:"
2-13-4,"Oh, the vulgar one! You, my enemy! You want to be happy after your desire isfulfilled when Rama the best among men leaves for the forest and when I die thereafter. Alas!"
2-13-5,"When celestials ask for me about Rama's well-being after I reach heaven, how can Iindeed convince them that he is well obscuringly the actual fact?"
2-13-6,"If I tell without obscuring the fact that I sent Rama to exile desirous of showingkindness to Kaikeyi, nobody will believe me."
2-13-7,"With much effort I, the childless begot the great and powerful Rama as my son. Howcan I abandon such Rama?"
2-13-8,"How can I send away Rama who is valiant and knowledgeable, who has subdued anger,who has forbearance and who has eyes like lotus-petals."
2-13-9,"How I can I send Rama, who is dark blue in colour like a blue lotus, who islong-armed , who is very strong and graceful, to Dandaka forest?"
2-13-10,"Rama is accustomed to comforts. He is not accustomed to difficulties. How can Iimagine such sensible Rama in a troublesome situation?"
2-13-11,"Oh, cruel one! One with sinful thoughts! Oh, kaikeyi! why are you planning to doharm to Rama who is beloved to me and who is truly heroic? I shall certainly get unequalled illfame and humiliation in this world."
2-13-12,"While Dasaratha was thus lamenting with his disturbed mind, there was approach ofnight with setting of the sun."
2-13-13,"To Dasaratha, who was thus lamenting painfully, the night seemed to be dark eventhough it was adorned with charming circular moon."
2-13-14,"The aged Dasaratha was lamenting painfully as though afflicted with a disease, withlot and hard breaths, having his eyes fixed on the sky."
2-13-15,"Oh, auspicious night, decorated with stars! do not wish you to do break into adawn. Have mercy on me. I pray with folded hands."
2-13-16,"Otherwise, Oh, Night! Leave away quickly. I do not went to see Kaikeyi, who isshameless, cruel and for whose reason this great calamity occurred"
2-13-17,"The king spoke like this and beseeched kaikeyi with folded hands. He again spokethis word to Kaikeyi."
2-13-18,"Oh, auspicious queen! I am a well conducted man. I am dejected and seeking refusein you. I am an old man and especially a king. Be kind to me."
2-13-19,"Oh, well-hipped one! I hope that whatever I told, has not merged in the sky. Oh!young woman, be kind to me . You are good-hearted."
2-13-20,"Oh, queen with dark outer corner of eyes be kind. You your self give my kingdom toRama. Thus, you will obtain great fame."
2-13-21,"Oh, broad hipped, with beautiful face and eyes! do this. It will be pleasing to me,to Rama, to the world, to priests and to Bharata."
2-13-22,"Hearing the king, who was her pure-hearted husband and who was pitifully lamentingstrangely with red eyes filled with tears, that bad tempered cruel woman did not follow hiswords."
2-13-23,"Seeing his discontented wife talking unpleasantly about sending Rama to forest, thatking was distressed, fainted again and fell down unconscious on the floor."
2-13-24,"While the distressed and self-respected king was sighing terribly in the way, thatnight came to an end. In the dawn, bards and singers started to awaken him. But the excellent kingprevented them to do."
2-14-1,"That wicked woman spoke these words to Dasaratha, tormented as he was by the anguishfor his son and who was unconscious, tossing about on the floor."
2-14-2,"What is this? After hearing the promise given to me, you are lying on the floordejected as though you had committed a great sin. You ought to keep yourself within bounds ofethics."
2-14-3,"People who know what is right, indeed speak of truthfulness as highest virtue. Itoo have taken refuge in truth and made you aware of your duty."
2-14-4,"Oh, king! Having made a promise to a hawk and offering his body to the bird , kingSaibya, the ruler of world obtained the greatest destiny."
2-14-5,"In that manner, Alarka the glorious man plucking his own eyes, indeed gaveremorselessly, to a brahmana skilled in the Veda, When asked for them."
2-14-6,"Following ruthfulness, ocean the lord of rivers even at the time of flow-tide, doesnot transgress even to a small extent its boundary because of its compliance to truth."
2-14-7,"Truth is one word and is Brahma. On truth is righteousness established. Truthindeed is the knowledge imperishable. By truth alone, the supreme being is obtained."
2-14-8,"O the best among men! firmly adhere to truth, if your mind is fixed on piety. Sinceyou are a bestower of boons, let my aforesaid prayer be granted."
2-14-9,"In the matter, yearning righteousness and to concede to my request, send Rama theson to exile. I am telling to you three times."
2-14-10,"Oh, the venerable man! If you do not implement our agreement, it means you haveabandoned me. Hence I will give up my life here in front of you."
2-14-11,"Thus compelled by Kaikeyi, who had no uneasiness in her mind, king Dasaratha couldnot untie the cord of plighted word that fettered him , any more than Bali could unloose the nooseplaced (round his body) by Indra(through his younger brother Vamana in order to deprive him of hissovereignty of the three worlds)."
2-14-12,"Like a bullock throbbing between yoke and the wheel , Dasaratha got agitated inheart and became pale in his face."
2-14-13,"King Dasaratha, with bedimmed eyes, was unable, as it were, to see. But withdifficulty, he controlled himself by recourse to firmness and spoke to Kaikeyi as follows."
2-14-14,"Oh, wicked woman! I abandon your hand, which was clasped by me in presence ofnuptial fire, when it was consecrated by sacred recitations as also your son begotten by me alongwith yourself."
2-14-15,"Oh, Queen! the night has gone by, with the return pf rising sun. Elderly peoplewill certainly quicken me for installation of Rama with the sacred materials procured for thepurpose."
2-14-16,"Oh, woman of vicious conduct! If you obstruct Rama's installation, you includingyour son cannot offer me water. Rama will be made to do the offering of water to me, afterdeath."
2-14-17,"Having seen people with that joy before, I cannot see them with there happinessended, without any merriment and having their faces turned downward in grief."
2-14-18,"While that great souled king was speaking to her as aforesaid, the holy nightendowed with, moon and stars began to become clear into a dawn."
2-14-19,"Kaikeyi of vicious conduct and of skilful talk, filled with anger again spoke theseharsh words to the king."
2-14-20," Oh, king ! You are uttering words, which cannot be swallowed easily like in apainful throat disease. You ought to summon your son Rama here without any delay."
2-14-21,"You will be the one who discharges duty, by installing my son to this kingdom, bymaking Rama to wander in woods and rid me of enemies."
2-14-22,"Impelled again and again by Kaikeyi, like an excellent horse being severely thrashedwith a whip, that king spoke these words to Kaikeyi."
2-14-23,"I am bound by the ties of morality. I lost my judgement. I wish to see the piousRama, my beloved elder son."
2-14-24,"Meanwhile, the night began to become clear, with the rising of sun. While theauspicious, moment united with lunar mansion approaching, the sage Vashishta who is rich in virtuessurrounded by his disciples entered the capital city of Ayodhya briskly, having procured therequisite materials for Rama's coronation."

2-14-26,"Sage Vashishta, being well pleased of seeing that gynaecium, got past those peoplethere and , entered it."
2-14-27,"Meanwhile, Vashishta saw Sumantra by name, who was charioteer-cum-minister ofDasaratha and who had a pleasing appearance coming out of the royal gate."
2-14-28,"That great splendoured Vashishta spoke thus to the learned Sumantra, ""Tell the kingquickly, that I have come."""

2-14-35,"How the splendid ocean gladdens at the time of sunrise, so do you by nature filledwith delight, gladden us with your delighted mind."
2-14-36,"At the very hour of sunrise, Matali (Indra's charioteer)praised Indra and thelatter conquered all the demons. In the same manner, I am awakening you."
2-14-37,"As Vedas along with the knowledge of the limbs of the body guide Lord Brahma (thecreator) who is self born, so am I awakening you now."
2-14-38,"Even as the sun along with the moon awaken the beautiful earth which sustains thebeings so, am I awakening you."

2-14-44,"King Dasaratha hearing his words which were soothing and meaningful, was surroundedwith grief once more."
2-14-45,"That king who was pious and glorious, having lost joy about his son, looked up withsorrowful red eyes and spoke those to Sumantra. ""You are chopping off my vitals further more, withyour words!."""
2-14-46,"Sumantra, after seeing the depressed king and hearing mournful words, joined palmswith salutation and slipped away to a distance from that place."
2-14-47,"Dasaratha could not say any thing himself because of depression. Then, Kaikeyi whois experienced in fore-thoughts, spoke thus to Sumantra."
2-14-48,"Oh Sumantra! The king, being smitten by emotional joy in relation to Rama, whotired of awakening the whole night and got subjected to sleep"
2-14-49,"Oh, Sumantra! Hence, quickly go and bring the glorious prince Rama. Blessedness toyou! Do not have any hesitation in this matter. "

2-17-8,"If we can see Rama going forth in the city after getting coronated today, it is enough of eating or other activities."

2-17-14,"Rama went by crossing road junction, god&#39;s paths, sacred trees and temples keeping his right side towards them."
2-17-15,"Rama approached the royal abode and entered his father&#39;s palace which was the best palace with blazing radiance like the palace of king of celestials on earth. All around the house, there were various types turrets looking like Mount Kailasa, as group of clouds, as white heavenly cars touching the sky. There were royal houses named vardhamana which were adorned with a net of precious stones."

2-18-3,"Dasaratha spoke only one word ""Rama!"" with his eyes filled with tears and dejected,being not able to see or to talk any further words."
2-18-4,"Having not seen earlier such a fearful form of his father, even Rama was frightenedas though he seized a snake by his foot."
2-18-5,"That king Dasaratha was sighing heavily with senses sans pleasure, emaciated withgrief and anguish, with distressed and agitated mind, like ocean which cannot be perturbed,becoming perturbed with row of waves, like sun which is eclipsed and who lost lustre like by a sagewho spoke untruth."
2-18-6,"Contemplating over the unimaginable sorrow of the king, he was very much perturbedas an ocean does on a full moon day."
2-18-7,"The ingenious Rama, who is fond of his father's welfare, anxiously thought : "" whyindeed the king is not greeting me in return just today?"""
2-18-8,"At other times, the father, even though angry used to be gracious after seeing mewhy today such a father has become weary after seeing me?"
2-18-9,"Rama indeed distressed and afflicted with grief, with lustre faded from his face,offered his salutation to Kaikeyi and spoke these words."
2-18-10,"I hope that I have not done anything wrong through ignorance. Tell me why father isangry with me. You alone propitiate him in my favour."
2-18-11,"Why my father, who was always affectionate to me, has become displeased? With hisface becoming pale and dejected, he is not talking to me."
2-18-12,"I hope that either bodily affliction or mental distress is not troubling him. Theobject of happiness is indeed difficult to be attained always!"
2-18-13,"I hope that no bad thing occurred to Bharata, the delightful man to look at or toShatrughna, the man of great strength or to my mother. "
2-18-14,"If our father becomes angry, I do not desire to live even for a moment withoutsatisfying him or without fulfilling his command."
2-18-15,"Man sees father as the visible god who is the root cause of one's own coming intoexistence and how else can he behave towards him other than like that?"
2-18-16,"I hope you have not spoken anything which hurt my father's conscience with yourpride and anger."
2-18-17,"I am asking you why my father got this perturbation, which was not there earlier.Tell me the true position."
2-18-18,"Thus questioned by the great souled Rama, Kaikeyi fearlessly spoke these words forher own benefit, without any shame on her part."
2-18-19,"Oh, Rama! The king is not angry. There is nothing of distress for him. But he hassomething in mind which he is not telling from fear."
2-18-20,"To him, words are not coming off to tell disagreeable utterance to you, the dearone. He promised me a word. It is to be certainly done by you."
2-18-21,"Long ago, the king honoured me and gave me a boon. Like a common man, he isrepenting now for having given the boon."
2-18-22,"This king promised me to give the boon and now he desires to build a dam wastefullyon a place where water has gone away."
2-18-23,"Oh, Rama! It is known by even wise men, that truth is the root of righteousness.See that the offended king does not abandon such a truth for your sake."
2-18-24,"The king is about to mention that truth which may look auspicious or inauspiciousto you. Still, I shall tell you all that, if you shall do it afterwards."
2-18-25,"If what is spoken by the king does not create unfavourableness in you, I shall thentell you. This king will not indeed tell you."
2-18-26,"After hearing the words of Kaikeyi, Rama felt painful and spoke thus to her in thepresence of the king."
2-18-27,"Oh, queen! what a pity! Do not talk like that to me. If father tells me, I shalljump even in fire. If father, who is a king, who wishes my welfare and who is venerable, commandsme, I shall eat fiery poison and shall sink into an ocean."
2-18-28,"Oh queen! Tell me the words of the king as desired by him. I even promise to do it.Rama does not speak two things."
2-18-29,"That vulgar Kaikeyi uttered very cruel words to that Rama, who was committed tosincerity and speaking of truth."
2-18-30,"Oh, Rama! During a battle and a great war between celestials and demons long ago, Iprotected your father who was pierced by darts. Then, he gave me two boons."
2-18-31,"Oh, Rama! According to those boons, I asked the king for coronation of Bharata andfor your going to Dandaka forest today itself."
2-18-32,"Oh, Rama! If you want to make yourself and your father faithful to a promise,listen to these words of mine."
2-18-33,"Abide by your father's command. As per his assurance, you have to stay in theforest for fourteen years."
2-18-34,"Bharata is to be enthroned with the use of complete collection of materials alreadyarranged by the king for your sake."
2-18-35,"You have to leave this coronation function and dwell in the forest of Dandaka forfourteen years, wearing braided hair and covered with a hide."
2-18-36,"Let Bharata rule this earth, by residing in Ayodhya filled with various types ofprecious thing together with horses, chariots and elephants."
2-18-37,"For this reason, king Dasaratha who is overwhelmed with sympathy towards you is notable to see you with his face, afflicted with grief."
2-18-38,"Oh, Rama! Do as per the words of the king and liberate him by giving your father anopportunity to maintain the truth."
2-18-39,"Though she was speaking such harsh words, Rama was not affected with sorrow. But themighty Dasaratha became highly disturbed, having been afflicted by the calamity occurred to hisson."
2-19-1,"Rama the annihilator of enemies heard those harsh and deadly words but wasunruffled. He spoke these words to Kaikeyi."
2-19-2,"Let it be, as you said it. I shall fulfil the king's promise, go to the forest fromhere to reside there, wearing braided hair and covered with a hide."
2-19-3,"But I want to know why the king, the inviolable and the subduer of enemies, is notgreeting me today as before."
2-19-4,"Oh, queen! you need not be indignant. I am telling before you that I shall go tothe forest, wearing rags and braided hair. Become delighted well."
2-19-5,"How can I not do faithfully an action dear to my father, as commanded by him aswell-wisher, venerable man, as person with right conduct and as king."
2-19-6,"My heart is burning indeed with one sorrowful feeling that king himself has notinformed me about Bharata's coronation."
2-19-7,"Without being asked, I myself would have gladly offered even Sita with kingdom,even my life, loved ones and wealth."
2-19-8,"Being directed by king, who is my father himself, how much more should I tell thatI can give everything to Bharata, duly obeying father's promise to fulfil your beloved desire."
2-19-9,"That is why, you console him. Why indeed the king is thus slowly shedding tears,with eyes gazed upon the floor?"
2-19-10,"Let messengers go now itself on fleet horses to bring Bharata from maternal uncle'shouse as per orders of the king."
2-19-11,"Immediately, I shall go to live in forest of Dandaka for fourteen years, withoutreflecting on whether my father's words are right or wrong."
2-19-12,"Hearing Rama's words, Kaikeyi felt glad that he would certainly go and urged him tomake haste at once."
2-19-13,"Let it be so. Messengers can go on horses having rapid speed, to bring back Bharatafrom his maternal uncle's house."
2-19-14,"But I think it is not quite appropriate for you who are enthusiastic to go toforest, to delay further."
2-19-15,"It is nothing but shyness that the king is not able to speak to you. Oh Rama, thebest of men! Do not worry about it."
2-19-16,"Oh, Rama! Your father will neither take his bath nor eat a meal until you leave thecity for the forest immediately."
2-19-17,"Hearing these words, the king saying ""what a pity! How much misery!"" was overwhelmedwith sorrow, fainted and fell in that couch adorned with gold."
2-19-18,"Rama lifted up the king and soon got hurried up to leave for the forest he was againinstigated by Kaikeyi as a horse was hit by a whip."
2-19-19,"Rama after hearing that vulgar woman's words, which were harsh and havingconsequence, was unruffled and spoke these words to Kaikeyi."
2-19-20,"Oh queen! I am not concerned with wealth. I want to receive the world hospitable.Know me as equal to a sage, abiding in righteousness alone."
2-19-21,"If I have to do whatever action is dearer to my revered father, that action is justdone in all respects even by renouncing life."
2-19-22,"There is not indeed anything of greater performance of duty than doing service tofather or than doing what he commands."
2-19-23,"Even if our reverent father does not tell me, I shall reside in the forest, devoidof people, now for fourteen years as per your word."
2-19-24," In the matter of coronation of Bharata, you told Dasaratha and not to me, eventhough you had every authority to tell, me directly. By this, it is known that you have not seenany merit in me. It is certain!"
2-19-25," Today itself, I shall go to the forest of Dandaka after bidding, farewell to mymother and also after consoling Sita."
2-19-26,"While ruling the kingdom, see that Bharata serves our father well. It is indeed anage-old practice."
2-19-27,"Dasaratha after hearing Rama's words was hurt very much with grief was unable totalk and wept loudly."

2-19-31,"Rama did a circumbulatory salutation around the auspicious materials collected forthe propound coronation and having fixed his attention respectfully on them, moved away slowly."
2-19-32,"As Rama was a pleasing personality, he was loved by all the people. The loss ofkingdom could not diminish such a great splendour of Rama as a night cannot diminish the splendourof the moon."
2-19-33,"In that Rama, who was leaving the kingdom after having decided to go to the forest,there was no perturbation of mind in him like in an ascetic who is beyond worldly pain andpleasure."
2-19-34,"Rama, the man of great courage, refused fans and umbrella, sent away his friends,chariot and citizens kept back sorrow in his mind, subdued his senses and entered his mother'shouse to inform the unpleasant news."
2-19-35,"The people adjacent to Rama could not visualise any change in the face of Rama whowas dignified and truthful in his words."
2-19-36,"Rama did not lose his natural joy, as an autumnal moon with lofty rays does not loseits natural splendour."
2-19-37,"Rama with his courageous spirit and of great fame, paying his respects to the peoplewith his sweet words, went nearer to his mother."
2-19-38,"Lakshmana, who got virtues equal to Rama, who was having great heroic valour and whowas the brother, kept the grief within himself and went along with Rama."
2-19-39,"When Rama entered, Kausalya's palace was filled with great joy. At that time, Ramadid not show any displeasure for the mihlap occurred in truth. He behaved like that because he haddoubted about the possible shock to his friends even of fear of their life, if he showed anyperturabation."
2-20-1,"While Rama, the best of men was leaving, after offering salutation to his father,women in the palace were weaping loudly."
2-20-2,"Which Rama, without being told by his father, used to do necessary activities andprotect the entire palace, is about to go to exile now""."
2-20-3,"Rama, since he was born, was showing the same attention to us, as he was showing tohis mother Kausalya."
2-20-4,"He used to avoid actions which created anger and soothed all those who were angry.Rama was not furious with those who abused him. Such Rama is going today to exile."
2-20-5,"Our stupid king by abandoning Rama who was helpful to all beings , is offending allthe beings."
2-20-6,"Thus, all the king consorts while weaping loudly, as cows which lost their Calves,abused their husband ."
2-20-7,"After hearing the terrific distressful crying sounds in the palace, Dasaratha clungto the seat, with extreme anguish for his son."
2-20-8,"Rama, who was greatly hurt, sighed like an elephant, subdued his senses and went tohis mother's palace along with Lakshmana"
2-20-9,"Rama saw a much worshipped old man sitting at the gateway of the house and manyother standing there."

2-20-26,"Oh,mother! You do not know that a great dismay is approaching now. It brings griefto you, to Sita and to Lakshmana"
2-20-27,"I am going to Dandaka forest. Why this seat for me? Time has come for me to sit ona seat made of Kusha grass."
2-20-28,"I shall live in a solitary forest like a sage for fourteen years, leaving off meatand living with roots, fruits and honey."
2-20-29,"The great king is giving to Bharata the succession to kingdom and to me, however,he is making me a sage to stay in the forest of Dandaka."
2-20-30,"I have to satisfy with the things existing in the forest and subsist with roots andfruits in a solitary forest for fourteen years."
2-20-31,"The queen Kausalya fell on the floor all at once like the branch of a tree, cut downby an axe and as an angel dropping down from heaven."
2-20-32,"Seeing Kausalya who was fit to be free from sorrow, Rama lifted up her, who hadfallen unconsciously on the floor like a plantain tree."
2-20-33,"Rama touched with his hand that miserable Kausalya,whose limbs were covered withfragrant powder and who rose like a loaded horse from the floor on which it rolled from side toside."
2-20-34,"Kausalya, who was fit for happiness but was afflicted with grief, spoke thus to Ramathe best of men who was sitting nearby, while Lakshmana was hearing."
2-20-35,"Oh, Rama! I would not have felt this much grief if I were childless .You are bornonly to produce sorrow to me."
2-20-36,"Oh, son! There is no other grief to a barren woman except the only worry that Ihave no sons""."
2-20-37,"Oh, Rama! I have not seen any happiness or prosperity earlier, while my husband isin power. I believed that I could see them at last when my son comes to power."
2-20-38,"I have to hear so many disagreeable words from my fellow-wives who are inferior tome and who pierce my heart with their words though I am a better and virtuous wife among them."
2-20-39,"Which one will be more sorrowful to women than this unending and consuming griefthat occurred to me now?"
2-20-40,"Even when you are near by, I am being rejected. What to tell after you leave forexile? Death indeed is certain to me."
2-20-41,"My husband always held me down, without giving me any independence and treat meequal to or even lower than the servants of Kaikeyi"
2-20-42,"Those who serve me now and those who follow me, will not speak to me, after seeingBharata""."
2-20-43,"Oh, son! How can I, the miserable one, see the face of Kaikeyi who talks hurtinglybecause of her continuous anger."""
2-20-44,"Oh,Rama! I have been waiting for seventeen years after your second birth of threadceremony, with the hope that my troubles will disappear at one time or the other."

2-20-48,"My heart is not breached, as bank of a great river, struck by new water in monsoon,by hearing this news.That is why, I feel it is strong."
2-20-49,"There is no death to me, indeed .I have no place in the abode of god yama whopresides over the spirits of the dead .That is why, Yama is not forcingly carrying me off like alion carrying off a wailing antelope."
2-20-50,"This grief is inserted into my body. Even then, my heart is stable. It has notbroken into pieces and fallen on the floor .It is indeed made of iron. There is no untimely death,it is certain"
2-20-51,"I feel bad since all my religious vows, charities, restraints have all gonewaste.The austerity I performed for the sake of of -spring has gone in vain, as a seed sown in asaline soil."
2-20-52,"If a man in great distress can get premature death out of his own will, I beingseparated from you ,would have attain the glory of the dead now itself like cow without thecalf."
2-20-53,"Moreover, what is the use of life? Oh, Rama! With your brilliant face shining likemoon! My life is useless without you. I shall accompany you to the forest like a weak cow goingbehind it's calf"

2-21-5,"I have not seen in this world any person, whether an enemy or an expellee, speaking ill of Rama indirectly."
2-21-6,"Can anybody observing ethicalness, causelessly get rid of a son who is equal to god who is honest, who is self-restrained and who is affectionate even towards adversaries?"
2-21-7,"Which son, knowing royal usage, can agree to the words of this king who is behaving as though he got childhood again?"
2-21-8,"Even before others get to know about this matter, make this dominion your own, with my help."
2-21-9,"Oh, Rama! While I am standing by your side along with a bow, protecting you who are standing as God of Death, who is capable of doing too much ?"
2-21-10,"Oh, Rama, the best of men! If the city of Ayodhya turns against you, I shall make it desolate of men with sharp arrows"
2-21-11,"I shall kill all those who are siding Bharata ,and are favourable to him. Soft person indeed gets disgraced!"
2-21-12,"If our father with an evil mind behaves like our enemy with instigation by Kaikeyi. I shall keep him imprisoned with out personal attachment or if necessary, kill him."
2-21-13,"Even a venerable person is to be punished, if he becomes arrogant, if he does not know good and evil actions and if he takes to a wrong route."
2-21-14,"Oh, Rama, the best of men! On what strength or season has he taken shelter to give away this kingdom belonging to you to Kaikeyi?"
2-21-15,"Oh, Rama the chestiser of enemies! Where is the ability for him to give kingdom to Bharata, by making great enmity against you and me "
2-21-16,"Oh, queen! Really, I am devotedly attached to my brother Rama. I am swearing an oath to you by truth by bow, by the act of giving and by the act of sacrifice."
2-21-17,"Oh, queen! If Rama can enter blazing fire or forest, you make certain that even before, I can enter there"
2-21-18,"I shall alleviate your grief, by showing my valour like the rising sun alleviating darkness .Let Rama and yourself see my valour"
2-21-19,"Hearing these words of Lakshmana the magnanimous, Kausalya entirely given up to anguish and weaping, spoke thus to Rama."
2-21-20,"Oh, son !You have heard the words of Lakshmana .If you agree, you do what is to be done, immediately."
2-21-21,"It is not proper for you to go away from here, leaving me afflicted with grief, after hearing the un-just words spoken by my co-wife."
2-21-22,"Oh, Rama! You are righteous man. If you desire to practice virtue, be a virtuous man and stay here serving me thereby practicing the best morality in the form of serving your mother."
2-21-23,"Oh, son! Formerly Kasyapa was staying in his own house itself with self restraint, performed great austerity by serving his mother and went to heaven"
2-21-24,"Just as the king, by respectable feeling to you is worthy of worship, so also being your mother, I am worthy of worship to you. Hence, do not go to the forest"
2-21-25,"After your separation, I shall have no use of this life or comforts for me, it is good even to eat grass while staying with you"
2-21-26,"I shall not live if you leave for the forest, leaving me who is afflicted with grief. I shall seek death through starvation"
2-21-27,"Oh, son! If I fast myself to death for your sake, you will attain the universally famous hell, like the god of the ocean obtaining trouble because of his un justice behaviour, towards the sage called Pippalada, producing the latter&#39;s wrath."
2-21-28,"The honest Rama spoke these virtuous words to his mother Kausalya, who was thus weeping miserably."
2-21-29,"I am not able to violate my father&#39;s words. I am bowing my head and asking your favour. I shall have to go to the forest"
2-21-30,"A sage called Kandu, who knew righteousness, who performed religious vows and who was a learned man, killed even a cow, acting as per his father&#39;s words"
2-21-31,"Previously, the sons of Sagara belonging to our race, were got bitterly digging up the earth, as commanded by their father."
2-21-32,"Parasu Rama, the son of Jamadagni personally slayed his mother Renuka in the forest with an axe as per his father&#39;s words."
2-21-33,"Oh, mother! These and many others who were equivalent to gods, did not make their father&#39; s words to go waste. I shall also do what is desired by my father"
2-21-34,"Oh, mother! I am not the only person to act according to father&#39;s command. Those I have mentioned to you hitherto also complied with their father&#39;s command."
2-21-35,"I am not setting any new contradicting customary conduct for your sake. I am adhering to the way agreed and followed by the ancient."
2-21-36,"I cannot do otherwise than acting in accordance with father&#39;s words, the prevalent practice on earth. There is no deprivation indeed for anyone who complies with father&#39;s commands."
2-21-37,"Rama, the best of those who speak skilfully and the best of all those wearing the bow, spoke thus to his mother and turned round to Lakshmana to speak."
2-21-38,"Oh, Lakshmana ! I know your highest affection towards me, your heroic valour ,your strength and your unassailable splendour ."
2-21-39," Oh, Lakshmana, with good attributes! My mother is feeling a great and unequalled sorrow, by not knowing the secret of truth and tranquillity."
2-21-40,"Righteousness is the best of all qualities in the world. Truth is established in righteousness. Even these best words of father are enjoined with righteousness."
2-21-41,"One who follows righteousness, does not waste his promise given to one&#39;s father or mother or Brahmana."
2-21-42," I cannot transgress my father&#39;s command. On the word given by my father only, Kaikeyi instigated me to go to the forest."
2-21-43,"Hence, leave this mean mentality of military heroism. Observe righteousness and not rudeness. follow my perception."
2-21-44,"Rama spoke thus to his brother affectionately, bowed to his mother and with folded hands, spoke again to Kausalya as follows."
2-21-45,"OH, mother! I have decided to go to forest. Please give me permission. I am swearing to you on my life. Please invoke blessings on me."
2-21-46,"As sage king named Yayati in olden times left the heaven and reached back heaven again, I shall be back to the city from the forest, after fulfilling my promise."
2-21-47,"Oh, mother! Please do not grieve, Bear it well in your heart. I shall come back here again from the forest after fulfilling the father&#39;s command."
2-21-48,"You and I, Sita, Lakshmana, Sumintra and all of us should follow father&#39;s directions. This is an eternal custom."
2-21-49,"Oh mother! Please approve my righteous intention of going to the forest, duly withdrawing preparations for my coronation and keeping in check the sorrow in your heart."
2-21-50,"The mother Kausalya heard the most virtuous, cool and steady words of Rama and rose, as though regained consciousness once more after death, looked at Rama and spoke thus again."
2-21-51,"Oh, son! I am also as respectable a person to you as your father, in my own right and due to great affection. I do not give permission to you. You cannot thus go away, leaving me in great sorrow."
2-21-52,"What is the use of my living in this world without you? What is the use of the other world or the oblation of food offered to the deceased ancestors or the nectar of immortality? Your proximity even for a moment is better than that of the entire world of living beings."
2-21-53,"After hearing the pathetic lamentation of his mother, he was highly anguished, as when an elephant is removed highly from its way by men with flames of fire."
2-21-54,"Rama, who was established in righteousness, spoke these words endowed with virtue, to his mother who was looking unconscious and to Lakshmana who was disturbed and exhausted with distress. He was the only person worthy of speaking thus at that time."
2-21-55,"Oh, Lakshmana! I always know your devotion towards me as well as your strength. But now, you are joining with mother in afflicting much trouble to me without looking at my opinion."
2-21-56,"Oh, Lakshmana! In obtaining the fruit of good works in the world, righteousness utility and free will are being considered. As a wife who is obedient, who is beloved and who is having good sons, good work yields all these three things."
2-21-57,"Only such an action, which is righteous, is to be initiated, leaving that in which wealth, desire and righteousness do not come together. One who is intested in wealth alone becomes indeed fit to be hated in the world. So also the one whose very essence is desire, cannot indeed be considered good."
2-21-58,"When father, who is venerable, a king and old-aged, commands an action either by anger or by extreme joy or by even desire, which right person will not perform it? Only a person who chooses to be cruel will not do it."
2-21-59,"I cannot avoid fulfilling the father&#39;s command completely. For both of us, he is an important person indeed to command us. To mother Kausalya also, he is the husband, the resource person and the personified law."
2-21-60,"while the righteous king Dasaratha is alive and especially when he is following his own righteous path, how the mother Kausalya can go out with me from here leaving the city like other widowed woman?"
2-21-61,"Oh, mother the queen! Permit me to go to forest. As Yayati returned to heaven by the power of truth, give me your power of blessings so that I can return here after completion of exile."
2-21-62,"I cannot keep back reputation and glory for the sake of kingdom alone. This cannot unrighteously long for this inferior kingdom."
2-21-63,"Rama, the best of men, decided to go to Dandaka forest fearlessly with his prowess, consoled his mother, advised his brother by good thoughts and made hearty circumbulatory salutation to his mother."
2-22-1,"Afterwards ,the self composed Rama by controlling his thoughts with courage ,approached the kind -hearted and affectionate brother Lakshmana who was distressed with agony who was very much angry like a hissing king cobra ,with his eyes dilated with wrath and spoke the following words."
2-22-2," Hold back grief and anger. Forget this insult, by taking refuge in courage alone. Obtain great joy! Abandon all these arrangements made today for my coronation and immediately take up action that is faultless ."
2-22-3,"Oh, Lakshmana! Show the same zeal now in terminating my coronation as the zeal shown earlier in preparations for my coronation."
2-22-4,"My mother Kaikeyi is still agonized about my coronation. Behave in such a way that no apprehension comes to her mind on this matter."
2-22-5,"Oh, Lakshmana! I do not wish to disregard the painful doubt in her mind even for a moment."
2-22-6,"I do not remember to have done even a small disagreeable thing here at any time to my mothers or to my father, either intentionally or unintentionally."
2-22-7,"Let the promise made by my father ,who is truthful, who is truly mighty and who is afraid of the fear of the other world, become true .Let him be fearless."
2-22-8,"Our father will feel anguished that his word has not come true ,if this coronation is not withdrawn. His distress will cause pain to me."
2-22-9,"Oh, Lakshmana for that reason, I wish to go to forest immediately from her, by withdrawing, coronation arrangement."
2-22-10,"Soon after my departure to the forest now, Kaikeyi having accomplished her purpose, will coolly get her son coronated."
2-22-11,"If go to forest , wearing deer -skin rags and with my hair twisted together Kaikeyi will have mental peace."
2-22-12,"I do not want to create trouble to my father, who has taken this hard decision in his mind . Hence, I will go to the forest at once"
2-22-13,"Oh, Lakshmana! Look at it as destiny which has taken back kingdom given to me and which is sending me to exile"
2-22-14,"'-If not making of destiny to create such a thought in Kaikeyi, how come she resolved to harass?"
2-22-15,"You know that I had no discrimination among mothers and Kaikeyi also in the past had no discrimination between me and her son Bharata"
2-22-16,"I do not perceive any other reason than an accident that made Kaikeyi to abolish my coronation , to send me to exile ,and to speak ferocious words ,not to be talked about."
2-22-17,"If it is for not an accidental reason, how Kaikeyi who is of a perfect temperament and who is born in a royal family can tell like a common woman to her husband to create trouble for me ?"
2-22-18,"The influence of destiny is un imaginable. No living being can counteract its influence. An adverse fate has befallen on me and on her .It is clear now ."
2-22-19,"Oh, Lakshmana! There is no means whatsoever to abstain from it otherwise than to follow the course of destiny. Who will be able to fight against the destiny. ?"
2-22-20,"Pleasure and pain, fear and anger, gain and loss, birth and death and such other things are all the acts of destiny"
2-22-21,"Even sages, who performed sever penance, having been harassed by destiny leave aside restraint and get ruined by lust and anger."
2-22-22,"It is indeed an act of destiny which suddenly and unimaginably obstructs an action, undertaken in the world ,at the starting point itself."
2-22-23,"Although my coronation is obstructed, I have no grief since I have restrained the self by myself with real consciousness."
2-22-24,"Hence ,you also ,like me, get the arrangements for coronation withdrawn immediately without any anguish"
2-22-25,"Oh, Lakshmana! Let all these very pots of water arranged for coronation be used by me for my bath after completing the religious vow of asceticism."
2-22-26,"Otherwise ,why to me this water in these pots ,which is royal property? The water drawn out by myself ,will be used for my bath after completing the religious vow."
2-22-27,"Oh, Lakshmana! Do not repent about this perverseness of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. When you talk of kingdom or dwelling in the forest, this is the final beautitude."
2-22-28,"Oh, Lakshmana! Do not suspect our mother for obstruction of coronation ceremony. She is uttering evil words, being overpowered by destiny. You are aware of this destiny, which has such influence."
2-23-1,"While Rama was thus speeding, Lakshmana heard, bowed down his head and got into themidst of pain and pleasure effecting his mind again and again."
2-23-2,"Lakshmana then firmed up his eyebrows and sighed with frown, like an angry snakefrom its hole."
2-23-3,"His wickedly looking face with eyebrows contracted, then appeared like the face ofan angry lion."
2-23-4,"Seeing Rama with the tip of his eyes obliquely, Lakshmana spoke to him moving hisforehand like an elephant moving its trunk and causing his head to fall in oblique and upwarddirection."
2-23-5,"Oh, the best of proud military community! This untimely great confusion is born inyou due to your conjecture of quilty righteousness and of non suspicion of the world. Can such aperson like you speak a person like you speak thus doubtlessly of the powerless destiny?"
2-23-6,"Why are you speaking about this weak and pitiable destiny? Why are you not doubtingthe sinful Kaikeyi and Dasaratha?"
2-23-7,"Oh, the righteous sould! Both of them are smoothly deceiving in the name ofrighteousness with an intent to keep away your good conduct, with selfish away your good conduct,with selfish motive and by dishonest means. You are not knowing."
2-23-8,"Oh, Rama! If it was not indeed an earlier decision taken long ago by both of them,the boon must have been given naturally even long ago."
2-23-9,"Enthroning other than yourself is not to the liking of the people. I cannottolerate this act that is started. Excuse me in this matter."
2-23-10,"Oh, Rama the great minded! This righteousness by which your intellect got disunitedand by which indulgence, you are stupefied, is disliked by me."
2-23-11,"you are capable of doing retaliatory action. How can you act on the word which isreprehensible and which is unjustified of your father who is surrendering obediently to the will ofKaikeyi?"
2-23-12,"Though they are doing this treachery with a sinful intent, I regret that you arenot grasping it. Such a conduct is to be censured."
2-23-13,"But of them, action on their own free will, were never desirous of your welfare.They are enemies in the name of parents. It is not proper even to think of fulfilling theirdesire."
2-23-14,"It may be your opinion that their action is influenced by mere destiny. Even then,I do not like you to be indifferent to this also."
2-23-15,"Only a confused and cowardly person depends upon destiny. Brave men withself-respect do not honour the destiny."
2-23-16,"That person who is capable of keeping off destiny by human effort, does not haveregret in the sense of not being failed by destiny."
2-23-17,"Today, all can see how much prowess is there in destiny and in man. This day, thedistinction between man and the destiny will be clearly perceived."
2-23-18,"By which destiny, your coronation is seen crushed, I shall crush that destiny by myprowess. Let all people see it!"
2-23-19,"By my prowess, I shall turn back this destiny, as framing back an elephant which isnot caring a hook and which is fiercely running with violent force."
2-23-20,"Neither all the guardians of the world nor the three worlds put together canwithhold Rama's coronation today. Why to talk about father."
2-23-21,"Oh, King! Those who are secritlyadvocating you to live in a forest for fourteenyears, will have to reside in forest for fourteen years in that manner."
2-23-22,"That is why, I shall break down the hope of father and of Kaikeyi, who is tryingfor kingdom to her son by creating obstacle to your coronation."
2-23-23,"The strength of destiny cannot create that much pain as that which my terrificprowess will create to those who are opposed to my strength."
2-23-24,"At the end of a thousand years of your ruling the kingdom, you having gone to theforest, your sons will govern the kingdom."
2-23-25,"It is indeed a practice for ancient kings to go to the forest after keeping care ofpeople, to be nourished as children, into the hands of their sons."
2-23-26,"If you think that you do not want kingdom because of your doubt that the kingdomwill get disturbed due to unstable mind of king Dasaratha, you need not fear. I am promising you. Ishall protect the kingdom as a sea coast protects the sea. If not, I will not obtain the heroicworld of heaven."
2-23-27,"You become engaged in getting coronated with auspicious things. I for one iscompetent to ward off the kings by force."
2-23-28,"My arms are not meant for handsomeness alone. Bow is not for decoration. Sword isnot for tying around waist. Arrows are not for staying immobile. All these four are intended forsubduing enemies."
2-23-29,"I do not wish to tolerate too much the one who is considered as enemy to me. Bywearing a sword with sharp edge which is mavingly bright like lightening, I do not care any enemy,even Indra himself. This earth will become impermeable, uninhabited with heads hands and thighs ofelephants horses and men crushed, having been hit by my sword."
2-23-30,"Now, elephants can fall down on earth, being hit by the gush of my sword, likemountains in blaze, like clouds, savidyutaH = with flashes of lightening."
2-23-31,"As I stand holding a bow with fingers wound with shields made of allegator-skin,how any man will fancy himself a hero among men?"
2-23-32,"While I overpower one with many arrows and many with a single arrow, I discharge myarrows at vitals of men, horses and elephants."
2-23-33,"Oh, Lord! Today, the strength of my excellent arrows is capable of making yousovereign and making Dasaratha devoid of power."
2-23-34," Oh, Lord Rama! Today the effect of my weapons will remove the power from the kingDasaratha and give the lordship to you."
2-23-35,"Oh, Rama! These arms worthy of wearing sandalwood essence and bracelets; forbestowing riches and for protection of friends can today do every action to prevent the agents whowant to obstruct your coronation."
2-23-36,"Tell me now itself who your enemy be made deprived of life, honour and friendship,by me. Command me so that how this earth will become your dominion. I am your servant."
2-23-37,"Then, Rama spoke thus to Lakshmana after consoling him time and again by weeping offhis tears; ""Oh, Lakshmana! I stand by the words of our father. This indeed is a good path."""
2-24-1,"Seeing him firm minded in protecting the command of his father, Kausalya in a chokedvoice spoke these righteous words:"
2-24-2,"�Rama who is born in me and Dasaratha, is a righteous person. He speaks lovingly toall beings. He has not faced grief at any time. How can such a person live in a forest, bygathering grains ?'"
2-24-3,"While the dependants and the servants of Lord Rama eat pleasant foods all thewhile, how can he eat roots and fruits himself in the forest ?"
2-24-4,"Hearing that Rama the beloved and virtuous is being thus sent to exile by the king, who will believe these words? Who will not develop fear ?"
2-24-5,"�Oh, Rama ! If you , the charming in the world are to go to exile , then it can becertainly said that everything is ordered by a strong destiny'"
2-24-6,"Oh, Son! Soon after your departure to a distant forest, a great and incomparablefire of sorrow will generate in my whole body. The wind which flares it up is your not being seenhere. My lamentation and grief are the fire-sticks. My wailing tears will be the offerings as anoblation to fire. The choking and anxiety will be a great smoke .The thought that when you wouldreturn, will generate smoke again. Such a fire of grief will make me emaciated completely and willburn like dry wood by fire in winter.'"
2-24-7,"Oh, Son! A cow follows its calf wherever it goes. So also, I shall come with youwherever you go.'"
2-24-8,"Oh, son! A cow follows its calf wherever it goes. So also, I shall come with you wherever you go."
2-24-9,"Kaikeyi already deceived the king .He will not be alive, when I leave for theforest and you also leave him .It is certain."
2-24-10,"To a woman, abandonment of husband is entirely a cruel act. That bad act is not tobe perceived even by mind."
2-24-11,"Till Dasaratha, my father and the great king is alive, you should serve him well.It is eternal justice."
2-24-12,"After Rama spoke thus, Kausalya with auspicious appearance, was very much pleasedand spoke to Rama, who performs indefatigable actions, in consent."
2-24-13,"That Rama, the best among upholders of righteousness, after hearing the words of hismother ,spoke again to her who was very much distressed."
2-24-14,"The words of father are to be followed by you and me. For all, he is the king, thenourished, a venerable man, the best among men, the lord and the ruler."
2-24-15,"After roaming in the great forest for fourteen years, I shall come back and verygladly stand by your command."
2-24-16,"After hearing the words of Rama, Kausalya who was affectionate to her son , was ingreat sorrow with her face filled with tears and spoke thus to her beloved son Rama ."
2-24-17,"Oh, Rama! I can not reside in the middle of these step-wives. If you have made upyour mind to go to forest as per your father's wish ,also take me, like taking a female deer of theforest ,to the woods ''"
2-24-18,"Rama spoke thus these words bemoaningly to her, who was weeping= as long as awoman is alive ,her husband is god and master to her""."
2-24-19,"King Dasaratha, supreme commander has authority over you and me also now. whenking, the lord of the earth and the wise man is there , we are not indeed master-less.'"
2-24-20,"Bharata also, who is a righteous person and who speaks lovingly to all beings willbe obliging to you. He is indeed always devoted to righteousness.'"
2-24-21,"While I take leave, take care of the king attentively so that he will not getfatigued even a little with grief over his son."
2-24-22,"Act always soothingly for a well-being of the aged king, seeing that his terriblegrief will not destroy him ."
2-24-23,"�Even if a woman is interested in religious vows and fastings in addition to beingthe best of the excellent ;if she does not obey her husband she will become ill-fated !''"
2-24-24,"�Even if a woman does not offer salutation to celestials and does not worship thegods, she will attain the highest heaven by service to her husband ."""
2-24-25,"�She has to do service, truly devoted in love and welfare of her husband. This isseen in the world from the beginning, was heard from ancient texts and mentioned asrighteousness.'"
2-24-26,"Oh, Mother! You always worship gods by sacrificial fire and by flowers for my sake .Brahmanas also with right voes are to be worshipped .'"
2-24-27,"Look forward for the time of my return in such a manner with restraint, beingtemperate in food and being devoted in the service of your husband."
2-24-28,"After my return, your best desire will be fulfilled if our father the best amongprotectors of righteousness ,is still alive till then."
2-24-29,"Kausalya who was afflicted with grief over her son, was with eyes full of tearsafter hearing Rama's utterances and spoke thus to Rama."
2-24-30,"Oh, Brave son! I am not able to avert your well-made resolution, in the matter ofyour going to forest. Time is inscrutable .It is certain."
2-24-31,"Oh, son! You go undisturbed. Let there be auspiciousness always to you .I shallbecome refreshed, when you return again."
2-24-32,"You, the illustrious after accomplishing a purpose, having observed a vow andhaving attained freedom from debt to your father, after having come again, I shall get greathappiness."
2-24-33,"The path of the destiny, which extinguishes my words and impels you to go to theforest ,is ever not imaginable on this earth"
2-24-34,"Oh, Rama the valiant !Go just now and come again safely, when you will rejoice mewith your pleasing and tranquillising words ."
2-24-35,"How good it will be, if today itself is the day of your returning from the forest,wearing twisted hair and garment made of bark."
2-24-36,"The queen kausalya thus saw Rama who decided to go to forest .She spoke these wordswith most excellent mind to Rama having auspicious qualities, being desirous of averting evil byrecitation of auspicious words."
2-25-1,"Kausalya, the magnanimous mother putting away her grief, sipped water from the palmof the hand, became purified and performed rites conducive to the welfare of Rama."
2-25-2,"Oh, Rama! Your departure cannot be restrained, depart now, return soon. Abide inthe footsteps of the virtuous."

2-30-13,"Oh, beloved! I shall reckon the dust raised by the strongest wind that will covermy body as sandal dust of highest advantage."
2-30-14,"While dwelling in the forest, in its midst, I shall lie down on green grass. Willlying in beds with carpets be more comfortable than that?"

2-30-20,"Oh, Lord! As a result of grief I will not going to live even afterwards whenabandoned by you. Death is therefore better at the time of your relinquishment itself."

2-30-30,"Oh Seetha, with thighs like the posteriors of an elephant! Earlier, righeousness(like fulfilling the father's command) was practised by good men. Now, I shall follow thatrighteousness, like Suvarchala(wife of the sun) following the sun."

2-30-38,"I desire to obey in the same manner as to how my father, abiding in truthfulnessand virtue, commands me. That itself is indeed the law of morality, which is eternal."

2-31-9,"You are so friendly, interested in righteousness, valiant, abiding always in a goodpath, dear to me as life, obedient, my brother and a companion."
2-31-10,"Oh Lakshmana! If you proceed to the forest along with me now, who will supportKausalya or the illustrious Sumitra?"
2-31-11,"That emperor of great splendour, who used to shower blessings on the people as acloud sends down rain on the earth, stands circumscribed by cord of love."
2-31-12,"That Kaikeyi daughter of king Aswapathi, after obtaining this kingdom, willcertainly not accord good treatment to her step-wives, who are at grief."
2-31-13,"Bharata on acquiring the kingdom will be devoted to Kaikeyi and will not think ofsorrowful Kausalya or Sumitra."
2-31-14,"Oh, Lakshmana! You stay here and support the venerable Kausalya through your ownself or by obtaining favour through the king. Do this thing, as said."
2-31-15,"Oh, Lakshmana the knower of righteousness! Thus, your devotion towards me will havebeen fully demonstrated by you. By honouring the elders, a great unqualled religious merit willaccrue to you."

2-31-24,"You along with Seetha enjoy yourself on mountain-ridges. I shall do everythingwhile you are waking or sleeping."
2-31-25,"Rama, very much delighted of hearing these words, said to him: ""Oh, Lakshmana! Go,take leave of all your friends."""
2-31-26,"Oh, Lakshma!

2-31-31,"I also desire to give to those excellent brahmanas residing here as strong devoteesto their proceptors and to all my dependents."

2-33-17,"Let Kaikeyi obtain the houses deserted by us, their treasures unearthed, theircourt-yards in ruined state, their wealth and food grains removed, their best parts robbed off fromall sides, covered by dust, deserted by the deities(presiding them), overrun by mice, coming out oftheir holes and turning round here and there, without water and smoke, upswept, the rises ofoffering oblations to all creatures as well as the sacred fire, worship of gods, the chanting ofsacred texts and muttering of prayers having altogether ceased, as though dilapidated by adversetimes and scattered with broken vessels."
2-33-18,"As Rama is going away to the forest, let that forest become a city and let this citybeing deserted by us become a forest."
2-33-19,"Scared by fear of us, let all the snakes abandon their holes, the dears and birdsthe mountain peaks, the elephants and the lions the forest itself. let them leave the region goingto be inhabited by us and reach the city of Ayodhya."
2-33-20,"Let Kaikeyi with her son along with her relatives indeed inhabit the region whereferocious animals and vultures live with grass, meat and fruits. Let us all (on the other hand)live happily in the forest along with Rama."
2-33-21,"Rama heard various kinds of remarks thus made by many people. Hearing them also, hismind was not disturbed."
2-33-22,"That Rama the virtuous man, by walking with strides of an elephant in rut,approached his father's palace, which from a distance glowed like a peak of the Kailasamountain."
2-33-23,"After entering the royal palace, which had in it disciplined and valiant attendants,saw Sumantra standing dejected not far from the palace."
2-33-24,"The, Rama even on seeing the people disturbed, appeared unmoved and smiling,intending to fulfill his father's behest and went to see his father."
2-33-25,"Seeing Sumantra appearing disturbed before that, Rama the son of Dasaratha( a scionof Ikshhvaaku) whose mind is mighty and who is setting out to the forest, waited awhile to have hispresence announced to his father."
2-33-26,"That Rama, who had passion towards piety, having made up his mind positively toenter the exile as per his father's command, spoke thus, seeing Sumantra, ""Inform my arrival to theking."""

2-34-1,"Thereafter, the lotus-eyes Rama, who was dark-brown in complexion and great beyondcompare, spoke thus to the charioteer, ""Tell about me to my father."""
2-34-2,"Quickly entering inside, when sent by Rama, the charioteer saw the king havingsighs, his senses disturbed by grief."
2-34-3,"He saw the king resembling an eclipsed sun, like fire covered by ash, as a lakewithout water."
2-34-4,"The charioteer, a great intellectual, saw Dasaratha repenting with his mind greatlyagitated and approached him with joined palms."
2-34-5,"The charioteer, first inspiring the king with blessings of triumph, spoke thus in aslow and sweet voice, overcome with fear."
2-34-6,"Your son, the tiger among men, having given away all his wealth to brahmanas anddependents, is waiting at the gate."
2-34-7,"May auspiciousness betide you! Let that Rama, who is unfailingly brave, see you.After bidding farewell to all friends, he wants to see you now."
2-34-8,"Oh, king! Rama is setting out to a great forest. See him who is resembling a sunwith rays of light, displaying royal qualities."
2-34-9,"That king Dasaratha, who speaks truth, whose mind is virtuous, who is like an oceanby his depth of character and who is blemish less like a sky, replied to Sumantra as follows:"
2-34-10,"Oh, Sumantra! being all my wives, who are here. Surrounded by all of them, I wantto see the virtuous Rama."
2-34-11,"Sumantra, after entering the gynaecium, spoke these words to those women as follows:""Oh, the venerable ladies! The king is calling you. Go there without delay."
2-34-12,"All those women, asked thus by Sumantra as per the king's orders, went to hispalace, after knowing the instructions of their husband."
2-34-13,"Encircling Kausalya, three hundred fifty women, steadfast in their vow(of devotionto their husband), with their eyes reddened, went there slowly."
2-34-14,"After arrival of his wives, king Dasaratha spoke to that charioteer as follows, ""Oh,Sumantra! Bring my son here."""
2-34-15,"Taking Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha, that charioteer then speedily went to the king'spresence."
2-34-16,"King Dasaratha surrounded by women, seeing from a distance his son coming withfolded hands, distressed as he was, rose swiftly from his seat."
2-34-17,"Seeing Rama, King Dasaratha ran speedily towards him. But without reaching him hefell on the floor senseless, afflicted as he was with sorrow."
2-34-18,"Then, Rama and Lakshmana an eminent car-warrior, quickly approached that king whoseemed unconscious with full of grief as he was, through agony."
2-34-19,"Sounds of thousands of women crying ""Alas! Alas! Oh Rama!"" generated all at oncefrom the royal palace, mixed with the sound of tinkling ornaments."
2-34-20,"Holding Dasaratha in their arms and crying, both Rama and Lakshmana along withSeetha laid him on the couch."
2-34-21,"Then, Rama with folded hands spoke thus to king Dasaratha who got consciousnesswithin a short time and who was inundated in a sea of sorrow."
2-34-22,"Oh, emperor! I take leave of you, who are the lord of all of us. See auspiciouslytowards me, who am about to leave for Dandaka forest."
2-34-23,"Permit Lakshmana also and Seetha too who is accompanying me to the forest. Even ifprevented(by me0 on many true reasons, these two are not agreeing to stay behind"
2-34-24,"Giving up grief, Oh the bestower of honour, grant leave to all of us, Lakshmanamyself and Seetha as Brahma(the lord of creation) did to his sons(sanaka and his three brothers whointended to go to forest for practising austerities)."
2-34-25,"Gazing at Rama who is unruffled, awaiting permission of the king for stay in theforest, the king Dasaratha spoke thus:"
2-34-26,"Oh, Rama! I was stupefied by Kaikeyi through a boon. Now, by confining me, be youthe king of Ayodhya."
2-34-27,"When told thus by the king, Rama the best man in supporting righteousness and who isproficient in expression, replied( as follows) to his father, after making salutation with joinedpalms."
2-34-28,"Oh, king! You be the ruler of the earth for thousand years. But, I for my part,will stay in the forest. For my sake, do not generate untruth about you."
2-34-29,"Oh, ruler of men! Having strolled in the forest for fourteen years, I shall claspyour feet once more after fulfilling my promise."
2-34-30,"Prompted secretly by kaikeyi, the distressed king, tied up by fetters of truth, saidweeping to that beloved son."
2-34-31,"Oh, darling! Proceed for welfare, for advancement and for coming again. Let yourpath of travel be auspicious, undistracted and fearless from any quarter."
2-34-32,"Oh, darling, the seion of Raghu! Truthful as you are by nature and your mind beinggiven to righteousness, your decision cannot be reversed."
2-34-33,"Oh, son! Do not leave in any case today, now at night time. Even by seeing you forone day, I may live happily."
2-34-34,"Looking at your mother and myself, stay at least for this night today. Satiated byall the desired objects, you may leave tomorrow at dawn."
2-34-35,"Oh Rama, my son! An incorrigible thing is being done by you since for my pleasureyou are going to the forest a solitary place, leaving beloved ones."
2-34-36,"Oh Rama my son! Your exile is not agreeable to me. I was cheated by Kaikeyi who hadconcealed intentions and resembled fire with ashes."
2-34-37,"Incited by Kaikeyi who has destroyed established customs, you wish to redeem mydeceit, derived by me from her."
2-34-38,"It is not a great surprise, my son, that you my eldest son should seek to make yourfather as one who does not have false promises."
2-34-39,"After hearing these words of their father who was depressed, Rama and Lakshmana wereupset. Then Rama spoke these words."
2-34-40,"Even if these worldly pleasures are obtained today, who will offer those things tome tomorrow? Therefore I desire only to get away in lieu of all these enjoyments."
2-34-41,"This earth being relinquished by me; which included various provinces, filled withpeople, imbued with riches and food grains, may be given to Bharata."
2-34-42,"I cannot budge now from my decision made about my stay in the forest. Oh king thebestower of boons! You were pleased to give a boon to Kaikeyi and let it be fulfilled completely.Be you a truthful man."
2-34-43,"I , as promised, fulfilling your command, shall live in the forest along withforest-dwellers for fourteen years."
2-34-44,"Oh, king! Do not have any hesitation in offering the kingdom to Bharata. Neitherkingdom nor happiness indeed is desired by my nature. It is dear to me only to do your command asdirected."
2-34-45,"Let your sorrow disappear! Do not be overwhelmed with tears. The ocean, the lord ofrivers which is difficult to assail, indeed does not get agitated."
2-34-46,"I do not crave for kingdom or happiness nor again for Seetha nor even all theseenjoyments nor for heaven nor even for life."
2-34-47,"Oh, Jewel among men! I wish you to be a truthful mean, not a fallacious man. Iswear to you in your presence by truth and by virtue."
2-34-48,"It is not possible for me, Oh father, to stay on even for a moment. Therefore,contain this grief, Oh Lord, for there is no going back upon my word."
2-34-49,"Oh Dasaratha the seion of Raghu! I was indeed asked by Kaikeyi to go to the forest.It was also replied by me that I would go. I shall redeem that pledge."
2-34-50,"Oh, king! Do not feel anxious. We shall sport in the forest, flocked with peacefuldeer and rendered noisy by birds of various types."
2-34-51,"Oh, father! It was indeed said that even for celestials, father is the god.Therefore, I shall carry out the father's word, considering it as divine."
2-34-52,"Oh father, the best among men! You will see me, when I come back after elapsingfourteen years. Let this grief be given up."
2-34-53,"Oh, tiger among men! Why have you got perturbed-you by whom all these people bathedin tears, ought to be consoled?"
2-34-54,"Let this city, province and whole of this earth left by me, be given to Bharata. Ifor one following your instructions, shall proceed to the forest to dwell in it for long."
2-34-55,"Oh, king! Let this earth with multitude of mountains, comprising of cities withtheir gardens relinquished by me, be ruled over barely by Bharata, within the bounds ofrighteousness. Let the word of honour given by you(to Kaikeyi) come true."
2-34-56,"Oh, the faultless king! My mind is not directed on haughty physical enjoyments orsensuous pleasures which is approved by the wise. Let your agony disappear, for my sake."
2-34-57,"Oh, the sinless king! Therefore, now associating you with untruth, I just do notdesire for kingdom, nor all the sensual enjoyments, nor happiness nor existence nor even Seetha.Let your pledge(given to Kaikeyi) prove true."""
2-34-58,"I shall be happy, entering the forest filled with wonderful trees, eating fruitsand tubers as well as seeing mountains rivers and lakes in the forest. Let there be satisfactionfor you."
2-34-59,"Embracing his son, that king Dasaratha, who had thus fallen on evil days, wastormented with grief and distress, got fainted, fully losing his consciousness and not moving evena little."
2-34-60,"Then, all the queens assembled there except Kaikeyi began to cry. Sumantra also fellinto a swoon, while weeping. Everything there became loud lamenting."

2-35-1,"Then, moving his head all of a sudden sighing again and again, rubbing his hand inhand, grinding his teeth, turning his eyes red with anger shedding his normal colour, overwhelmedwith wrath, suddenly getting the evil grief, carefully reading Dasaratha's mind, sumantra thecharioteer spoke(as follows) as though shaking Kaikeyi's heart with sharp arrows, in the form ofthunderbolting words speedily peircing all her vitals."
2-35-2,"There is nothing on earth, anything which is most disgraceful for you by whom yourhusband king Dasaratha the supporter of the entire creation the unmoving and the moving, isbetrayed, Oh, Kaikeyi!"
2-35-3,"King Dasaratha is unconquerable as great Indra, unshakable as mountain andimperturbable as a great ocean. By tormenting him with your actions, you are considered by me asmurderess of your husband and ultimately the exterminator of your race too."
2-35-4,"Do not despise Dasaratha the supporter, the bestower of boons and your husband. Forwomen, will of the husband is superior to that of ten million sons."
2-35-5,"After death of a king, kingdoms are obtained as per the age of the princes. But,you want to deprive this condition in the case of Rama the lord of Ikshvaku dynasty."
2-35-6,"Let your son Bharata become the king and rule the earth. wherever Rama goes, we (onour part) shall go there."
2-35-7,"Now any brahmana cannot indeed dwell in your kigdom as now you want to do such anact, transgressing the due limits."
2-35-8,"Certainly, all of us will proceed in the path followed by Rama. Oh, queen Kaikeyi!What pleasure will be derived through attainment of soverignity, when your relatives, all brahmanasand pious souls desert you forever? Now, you want to do such an act of impropriety"
2-35-9,"I am looking only with surprise, why the earth is not immediately rent asunder,while you conduct yourself with such an act"
2-35-10,"It is also surprising me why rods of reproaching words fiery and fearful to look atuttered by great brahmana sages are not killing you, who are bent on sending Rama to exile."
2-35-11,"Who will nurture a neem tree, cutting down a mango tree with an axe? And a neemtree will not turn sweet for him who nourishes it with milk."
2-35-12,"I think, by birth your nature is as exactly as that of your mother. a proverb isquoted in the world saying that honey does not ooze from a neem tree."
2-35-13,"We know, as heard of in the past, your mother's conduct of evil satisfaction.Someone capable of giving boons, granted a great boon to your father. By that boon he couldidentify the language of all created beings. The talk of those beings belonging to sub humanspecies could be known by him."
2-35-14,"From the sound of an ant called Jrimbha near his bed, the meaning of that sound wasdeciphered by your exceedingly brilliant father and he laughed over it repeatedly."
2-35-15,"Your mother, becoming angry over his laugh, wishing even to hand him to death(incase he refuses to disclose the reason for his laughter), spoke thus: ""Oh king, the gentle sir! Iwant to know the meaning of your laughter."""
2-35-16,"The king replied to that queen as follows: Oh, royal lady! If I tell you thereason of my laughter, my death will immediately follow thereafter. There is no doubt aboutit."""
2-35-17,"Your mother then said to your father, the king of Kekayas, Live or die as you will.tell me the laughter. Do not ridicule me."
2-35-18,"Having been spoken thus by his beloved consort, the said king of the Kekayas on hispart correctly reported the matter to the sage who had bestowed the boon on him."
2-35-19,"Then the sage who had bestowed the boon replied to the king as follows: ""Oh, lord ofthe earth! Let her die or ruin. Do not reveal the reason to her."""
2-35-20,"Having heard the words of that sage who was pure-minded, the king repudiated yourmother and lived happily like Kubera the Lord of riches."
2-35-21,"Oh, Kaikeyi, seeing evil everywhere! You, too, thus following the path trodden bywicked men, are making this bad resolution by ignorance."
2-35-22,"The popular saying that males are born confirming to their fathers and females totheir mothers, occurs to me as true."
2-35-23,"Do not conform to the traits of your mother. Understand that which is said by theking. following the desire of your husband, be a protectress to these people here."""
2-35-24,"Incitedby the evil minded, do not put before the public an improper course ofconduct of your husband who spendour is equal to that of king Devendra and who is a protector ofthis world."
2-35-25,"Oh, Kaikeyi! Dasaratha the faultless man, the majesty, the lotus-eyed man and theking cannot indeed belie the promise given to you(Hence, you alone has to change your opinion)"
2-35-26,"Let Rama the eldest(of the sons) who is generous strong skilled, capable ofprotecting his own duty as Kshatriya but also of protecting the world of living beings, beinstalled on the throne of Ayodhya"
2-35-27,"Oh, Kaikeyi! A great accusation will surely roam about you in the world, if Ramaleaving his royal father goes to the forest."
2-35-28,"Let Rama of that character protect this kingdom! Be you free from distress. Thereis none other than Rama living in your excellent city who is competent to rule this Ayodhya"
2-35-29,"In the event of Rama being installe din the office of the prince Regent, KingDasaratha wielder of the great bow will surely have recourse to the forest, cherishly recollectingthe conduct of his forebears"
2-35-30,"Thus, Sumantra repeatedly with joint palms, caused a shaking to Kaikeyi in the royalassmebly, by his kind words as well as bitter words."
2-35-31,"That queen Kaikeyi, however, was neither excited nor repented in her heart nor wasany change observed in the colour of her face."
2-35-32,"Thus completes 35th chapter in Ayodhya Kanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki,the work of a sage and the oldest epic.</h4><h3><a name=""VerseLocator"" id=""VerseLocator""></a>Verse Locator

2-36-1,"Then, Dasaratha the scion of Ikshvaku dynasty, squeezed by his own promise in thematter of sending Rama to exile, sighed heavily with tears and spoke the following words again andagian to Sumantra."
2-36-2,"Oh, Sumantra! Let a military body consisting of (all) the four limbs of the arms,filled with the best of its kind, be arranged immediately"
2-36-3,"Let courtesans well versed in speaking and merchants with great riches havingexposure for extension of sales bestow elegance to the forces of the Prince"
2-36-4,"Appoint in this contingent those too, by giving abundant money to them who weredependent on Rama and on whom he took delight in gallantry"""
2-36-5,"Let important weapons, chiefs of police and vehicles, hunters knowing the secretsof forest accompany Rama(scion of Kakutsa)"
2-36-6,"Killing deer and elephants, drinking forest-honey, seeing various rivers, he wouldnot remember of sovereignty"
2-36-7,"Let the granary and the treasury belonging to me be sent to Rama residing in theuninhabited forest."
2-36-8,"Rama can spend his exile happily, by performing sacrificial rite in holy places anddisbursing appropriate gifts, along with sages living in the forest "
2-36-9,"The mighty armed Bharata will rule Ayodhya. Let the glorious Rama be sent alog withall objects of enjoyment"
2-36-10,"While Dasartha was speaking thus, fear drew near Kaikeyi. Her mouth too also gotparched. her voice also got choked."
2-36-11,"Feeling depressed and apprehensive, with her mouth getthing parched and her faceturned towards the king, Kaikeyi spoke as follows:"
2-36-12,"Bharata will not accept the kingdom, which will become uninhabited, hollow andwhich will be absolutely unenjoyable like wine, quaffed of its spiriteous part, Oh noble soul!"
2-36-13,"While Kaikeyi who has cast off her shame was thus uttering th emost cruel words,King Dasaratha spoke these words to that lady with large eyes:"
2-36-14,"Having charged me with a burden, Oh hostile woman, why do you prick me while I amcarrying it? Why did you not check before(while asking the boons by putting a condition that Ramashould not be allowed to take anything with him) the deed(of sending troups etc with Rama) in thebegining itself, Oh the vulgar woman!"""
2-36-15,"Doubly enraged in hearing this angry question of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi the beautifulwoman replied to the king as follows:"
2-36-16,"Spoken to as above, king Dasaratha uttered only a word ""Shame!"". The entire peoplethere were ashamed. But Kaikeyi did not perceive it"""
2-36-17,"There, the aged and the upright chief minister siddhartha by name who was highlyesteemed by the king, spoke to Kaikeyi these words:"
2-36-18,"Asamanja the evil-minded, catching hold of children playing in the street andthrowing them in the waters of saryu river, took delight in it"
2-36-19,"By watching him, all the citizens were angry and spoke to the king, ""choose eitherto keep yourself Asamanja alone or to preserve us, Oh the promoter of the state!"""
2-36-20,"Thereupon the king said to them, ""For what reason is this fear? Duly asked by theking, those people also replied these words:"
2-36-21,"He obtains incomparable delight by throwing, through stupidity, our playingchildren in sarayu river in a whirled state of mind."
2-36-22,"Hearing the words of those poeple, that king abandoned the son repugnant to hissubjects, in a bid to do good to them."
2-36-23,"Arranging immediately to place him along with his wife together with theparaphrenalia (like utensils, implements etc) in a vehicle, the king instructed his persons thus:""He should be exiled for life."""
2-36-24,"Roaming in all directions as though he has done sinful deeds, he ransacked mountainpasses, by taking a basket and a shovel."
2-36-25,"The highly righteous King Sagara abandoned Asamanja for perpetration sinful deedsas above. But, what sin Rama has done, for which he was debarred in this way?"
2-36-26,"We do not indeed perceive any fault in Rama. It is as difficult to find a taint inhim as in a new moon."
2-36-27,"Or if you see any fault in Rama, Oh Kaikeyi you tell about it now correctly. Then,Rama will be exiled."
2-36-28,"As it is contradictory to righteousness to abandon one who is guilty and who isdevoted to a good path, it would consume the splendour of even Indra (the ruler of gods)"
2-36-29,"Oh, Kaikeyi! Hence, there is no need of impeding the royal fortune of Rama. Oh,lady with a charming face! Even blame from the public should be taken care of by you."
2-36-30,"Hearing the words of Siddhartha, king Dasaratha spoke to Kaikeyi in the mosttiresome tone, with a voice choked with deep anguish, as follows."
2-36-31,"Oh, the sinful being! Do you not agree with these words of Siddhartha? By resortingto the path of the deplorable, you with a bad behaviour, are not alive to my interests or to yourown. Your action is deprived of a righteous path."
2-36-32,"I am accompanying Rama now, by abandoning my kingdom, happiness and wealth. Youenjoy the kingdom for a long time, happily together with Bharata the King."

2-37-1,"Hearing the words of the chief minister, Rama who was well-versed in courtesy, spokethen to Dasaratha as follows:"
2-37-2,"Of what use for me, who have forsaken enjoyments, cast away attachment foreverything and am going to live in the forest on nomadic food, Oh king, with an army accompanyingme?"
2-37-3,"Who, after giving away a first-class elephant, will work out his mind on a ropewith which it is tied? What use is there for him through attachment to the rope after abandaningthe excellent elephant?"
2-37-4,"Oh, the best among good men! So also, what use is there for me by the army Oh,King, when I am giving away absolutely all. Let the dresses of a mendicant be brought to me.'"
2-37-5,"I am going to reside in the abode of forest for fourteen years. Bring a shoel and abasket both for me."
2-37-6,"Thereupon, Kaikeyi shamelessly bringing personally of men, said to Rama; ""Put theseon"""
2-37-7,"Taking those two pieces of bark (as loin cloth and cover) from kaikeyi anddiscarding his clothing of fine yarn, Rama put on the garb of ascetics."
2-37-8,"Lakshmana too there itself before his father put on the clothing of ascetics, bydiscarding his beautiful raiment."
2-37-9,"Then, Seetha who wore silken clothing, by seeing the piece of bark intended to beworne by her, felt alarming as a deer would on seeing a snare(set for entrapping)"
2-37-10,"Feeling abashed while taking the wearing apparel made of Kusa grass and greatlytroubled in mind, Seetha who bore auspicious marks knew what is righteousness who was anillustration of righteousness spoke these words with her eyes filled with tears to her husband wholooked like Chitraratha(the king of Gandharvas)"
2-37-11,"How ascetics residing in the forest wear this piece of bark? Thus saying, Seethawho was not adept in wearing the bark of trees, erred again and again(in her attempt to wearit)"
2-37-12,"Keeping one piece of bark on her neck as well as holding it with her hand, Seethastood abashed, not adept as she was in wearing it."
2-37-13,"Rama, the foremost of those upholding virute, quicky came and personally fastenedthat bark over the sild garment of Seetha."
2-37-14,"Seeing the greatest Rama fastening the bark to Seetha in that manner, the women inthe gynaecium shed tears from their eyes."
2-37-15,"Very much distress as they were, they spoke to Rama of dazzling glory as follows: ""Dear child! This Seetha the high sould, was not so commanded to reside in the forest."""
2-37-16,"When you departed to the forest in seclusion following the words of your father, OhRama, let her sight be a reward to us till your return."
2-37-17," You go to the forest along with Lakshmana as your companion Oh son! Seetha thebeautiful girl is not fit to reside in a forest like an ascetic."
2-37-18,"Accept our prayer, Oh son! Let Seetha the beautiful young lady stay here. Indeed,you the ever righteous in any case do not wish to stay back."
2-37-19,"Even after hearing their words in this manner, Rama fastened that piece of bark toSeetha, who has a well-matched nature."
2-37-20,"Seeing Seetha accepting the piece of bark, Vasistha the king's preceptor preventedher and spoke thus to Kaikeyi."
2-37-21,"Oh the evil minded Kaikeyi, who have exceeded your limits, who have broughtdisgrace to your family! You are not establishing justifiable standard and you misled the king."
2-37-22,"Oh, the woman without decorum! Seetha the princess shall not proceed to forest. Shewill occuply the throne, which was awarded to Rama."
2-37-23,"A wife is very self to all, who constantly care for their wives. As Seetha isRama's self, she can rule the earth."
2-37-24,"Or rather, if Seetha goes to forest together with Rama, we also will follow suit.This city too will go."
2-37-25,"The fronitier- guards and the State including its patrons, as well as this citywith its goods and chattels will go whereever Rama and his wife are there."
2-37-26,"Wearing pieces of bark, Bharata along with Shatrughna will live along with Ramatheir brother residing in the forest and moving in the forest."
2-37-27,"Thereafter, singly you alone with bad conduct hurt to people, rule this earth whichis bereft of people and desolate, with its trees alone remaining."
2-37-28,"Where Rama is not a king, that place will not indeed become on kingdom. Thatforest, where Rama will be living, can become a kingdom."
2-37-29,"If Bharata is born to king Dasaratha, he is not fit either to rule the earth thatis not being offered by his father nor to live as a son in your case."
2-37-30,"Even if you can jump from the surface of the earth to the sky, Bharata who knowsthe record of his father's dynasty will not do as you wish him to do"
2-37-31,"therefore, an unfriendly act(alone) has been done by you, eventhough you arecovetons towards his well-being. There is none indeed in this world who is not devoted to Rama"
2-37-32,"Oh, Kaikeyi! You will see now itself that beasts, elephants, deers and birds goingwith Rama and trees also turning their faces towards Rama."
2-37-33,"Moreover, putting aside the bark of trees, give excellent jewellery to yourdaughter-in-law, Oh, Kaikeyi! the bark of trees is not ordained for her Thus saying so, Vasishtaprevented that wearing of garment by Seetha."
2-37-34,"Oh, Kaikeyi! It was solicited by you, the dwelling in the forest of Rama only. LetSeetha, to be decorated daily, be adorned with ornaments and live in the forest along withRama."
2-37-35,"Let Seetha go with excellent conveyances, well accompanied by attendants, with allcostumes and useful accessories. Her exile was not indeed solicted by you, while asking forboons"
2-37-36,"Eventhough Vasista, the preceptor of the king, who had an influenc beyond compareand the best of brahmanas was speaking as above, Seetha did not turn away here resolution to followthe ways of her beloved husband."

2-39-33,"Fourteen years will elapse, while you are asleep. you as such, will see me, dulyarrived here in my entire being, surrounded by my well-wishers."
2-39-34,"Uttering the aforesaid words of such quality and appropriate meaning to his mother,Rama thought once again and gazed at his three hundred and fifty step-mothers."
2-39-35,"Rama joined his palms and saluted those step mothers also, who were too distressedin the same way and spoke these words which were in consonance with the spirit ofrighteousness."
2-39-36,"Please excuse me, if I have done any mistake either becuase of our living togetheror due to ignorance on my part. I now take leave of you all."
2-39-37,"All those women, whose mind was overpowered with grief, heard the aforesaid coolsubmission of Rama, which was in consonance with righteousness."
2-39-38,"While Rama was speaking thus, an outery, resembling the wail of female cranes arosefrom those wives of Dasaratha."
2-39-39,"Dasaratha' s palace, which was earlier resounding with tomtoms, large drums andMeghas( musical instruments which sound like rumbling of clouds) was now filled with wails andcries and fallen on evil days."
2-39-40,"Thus completes 39th chapter of ayodhya Kanda in glorious Valmiki Ramayana, the workof a sage and the oldest epic.</h4><h3><a name=""VerseLocator"" id=""VerseLocator""></a>Verse Locator for

2-40-1,"Then, Rama Seetha and Lakshmana, who felt miserable, bowed down by touching the feetof the king and went round him clockwise with joined palms."
2-40-2,"After taking leave of Dasaratha, Rama who knew what is right and stood confounded bysorrow, bowed along with Seetha to Kausalya."
2-40-3,"Immediately following his brother, Lakshmana too bowed to Kausalya, then clasped thefeet of his mother Sumitra."
2-40-4,"Smelling (as a token of affection) the head of Lakshmana mighty armed, who wassaluting her, his mother Sumitra who wished well of him, spoke weepin, to that son of her ( asfollows)"
2-40-5,"Highly fond of your kinsman Rama, you have been pemitted (by me) to dwell in theforest(with your eldest half-brother). Do not neglect your half-brother). Do not neglect yourhalf-brother Rama, who is going to the forest, my son!"
2-40-6,"Oh, sinless one! Whether in adversity or in riches, he alone is refugee to you. Itshould become the code of conduct in the world, that younger brother should be subject to thecontrol of his elder brother."
2-40-7,"It is indeed a practice right from ancient times in your race, to make gifts, todedicate onself to performance of sacrificial rites and to foresake one's body to fightbattles."
2-40-8,"Thus speaking to Lakshmana, who was in readiness to leave the forest and who lovedRama dearly, Sumitra repeatedly said to him, ""fare forth, fare forth!"""
2-40-9,"Know Rama to be Dasaratha. Look upon Seetha the daughter of Janaka as myself.Consider the forest as Ayodhya and depart happily, my son!"
2-40-10,"Then, Sumantra the humble man, who was aware of humility, joined his palms and spokethese words to Rama even as Matali(charioteer of Indra) would to Indra (the ruler of gods)."
2-40-11,"Mount the chariot, oh the highly illustrious prince! May all be well with you! Ishall take you speedily, wherever you direct me to go."
2-40-12,"you have to reside in the forest for fourteen years. Those years, as directed bythe queen, are to be considered having commenced."
2-40-13,"Having adorned herself, Seetha with her comely buttocks, mounted with a delightedmind, that chariot which was shining like the sun."
2-40-14,"Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers quickly mounted that chariot, which wasreplendent like fire and decked with gold."
2-40-15,"For Seetha who was accompanying with her husband, Dasaratha gave away garments andjewellery, taking into consideration the period for which she had to stay in the forest."
2-40-16,"Even so for the two brothers, keeping the sets of weapon, an armour of hard makewith leather-cover in the midst of the chariot, Sumantra saw the three of whom Seetha constitutedthe third mounted and quickly drove the horses which were highly admired, with their swiftnessresembling the velocity of wind."
2-40-17,"Rama after departing to the great forest for a long term, unconsciousness prevailedin the city. There was faintness in the strength of people."
2-40-18,"The city( of Ayodhya) is filled with flurry, with its elephants intoxicated in rutand highly excited and resonant with tinkling of ornaments of horses."
2-40-19,"That city, including the youngsters and the old, stricken with extreme agony, rantowards Rama alone, in the same way as the one afflicted with heat of the sun rushes towardswater."
2-40-20,"Having down towards sides and back of the chariot with their faces turned towardsRama and with their faces filled with tears, all those people said with loud voices to Sumantrathus:"
2-40-21,"Hold in the reins of the horses and go slowly and slowly, Oh charioteer! We wouldbehold the face of Rama, which would be henceforth difficult to behold for us"
2-40-22,"The heart of Rama's mother(Kausalya) is surely and undoubtedly made of iron, sinceit does not get broken when Rama resembling an offspring of gods is going to the forest"
2-40-23,"Seetha(the princess of Videha kingdom) has done what ought to be done, by goingalong with him like a shadow, delighted in virtue as she was and does not leave her husband in thesame way as Mount Meru does not leave the efflugence of sun"
2-40-24,"Oh, Lakshmana! You are attending ever to your brother who speaks affectionately andis equal to the god. Ah, you are the accomplisher of purpose!"
2-40-25,"It is an immense fulfilment for you, it is a tremendous good fortune for you, nay,it is even a means to heaven that you are following this Rama"
2-40-26,"Saying so, those people were not able to restrain their tears that come and followedthat Rama, their beloved delight of the Ikshvakus."
2-40-27,"Then, the king with the distressed mind, saying that he would behold his belovedsaw, came out of his palace surrounded by women who were too dejected."
2-40-28,"In front of him was heard a huge noise of crying women, echoing like trumpeting offemale elephants when a lordly elephant has been pinioned."
2-40-29,"At that time, the father of Rama as is well known as a glorious king Dasaratha(ascion of Kakutstha) looked shrunk, like the full moon oversadowed by an eclipse."
2-40-30,"That glorious son of Dasaratha(Rama) of inconceivable courage, directed thecharioteer in the words ""Let the chariot be driven fast."""
2-40-31,"Rama commanded that charioteer with the words ""Move on!"" The people said to him""stop!"" Urged on the passage, the charioteer could not do both."
2-40-32,"The dust raised on the road due to moving out of mighty armed Rama, was suppressedby the falling tears of the citizens."
2-40-33,"With full of wailing tears, the citizens of after making loud cries becameunconscious with deep agony, at the time of departure of Rama."
2-40-34,"Tears born of anguish flowed from the eyes of women like(drops of) water fallingfrom lotuses by the commotion of fish."
2-40-35,"Seeing the city with singleness of mind, the glorious monarch Dasaratha fell downwith agony, like a tree slain at its root."
2-40-36,"Thereafter, seeing the king becoming feeble and much distressed, the outery of thepeople rose from the rear of Rama."
2-40-37,"Some poeple crying ""Oh, Rama!"" and some other scrying ""Oh, Rama's mother!"", made theentire women in the gynaecium to weap."
2-40-38,"Looking back, Rama saw the king sorrowful and perplexed in mind, as well as hismother following (him) on the road."
2-40-39,"Rama, bound by the chord of righteousness, could not gaze openly at his parents, asa foal caught in asnare would not properly look at its dam."
2-40-40,"Seeing them coming by foot, though worthy of a chariot, habituated to comfort andunworthy of suffering, Rama commanded the charioteer with words: ""Drive fast!"""
2-40-41,"Rama the tiger among men, feeling pained, as an elephant being pricked by a good,indeed was not able to bear that plight of his father and his mother."
2-40-42,"Rama's mother (Kausalya) ran towards her son, as a cow fond of her calf and whosecalf is tied(in a stall), runs home for her calf."
2-40-43,"Rama again and again saw that Kausalya, his mother who was crying thus, runningafter that chariot as though dancing, shouting""Oh, Rama, Rama!"" ""Oh, Seetha!"" and ""Oh, Lakshmana!""trickling tears descending from her eyes for the sake of Rama Lakshmana and Seetha."
2-40-44,"Dasaratha exclaimed saying ""Stop!"" while Rama called out ""Go on, proceed!"" (In thatway) Sumantra's mind became confused, as in between two (opposing) whirl pools."
2-40-45,"Rama said to him: ""You can say to the king that you did not hear (his call), evenwhen scolded (later). seeing their grief for a long time is quite unbearbale."""
2-40-46,"The charioteer, doing as per Rama's words, took leave of those citizens and drivethe horses more speedily even while they are going."
2-40-47,"The king's people returned after (mentally) going round Rama. Their minds did notreturn. Their impulse of tears also did not get reduced."
2-40-48,"The ministers spoke to king Dasaratha as follows:"" We should not follow to a longdistance him whom we wish to see come back."""
2-40-49,"Hearing their words, which were befilting with all virtues, the king Dasaratha feltmiserable, stopped short, gazing along with his wife, at his son Rama, with his whole bodyperspiring and wearing a dejected look."
2-40-50,"Thus completes 40th chapter in the AyodhyaKanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki,the work of a sage and the oldest epic.</h4><h3><a name=""VerseLocator"" id=""VerseLocator""></a>Verse

2-44-2,"That son of yours, oh the venerable one, is endowed with excellent virtues and isthe foremost among men. What is the use in your lamenting in this way or in weeping piteously?"
2-44-3,"Oh, noble lady! Your son is having mighty strength. He proved his high- soledfather perfectly truthful by renouncing his throne. He stood firmly in righteousness, which isalways practiced perfectly by disciples and which gives fruits even after death. That Rama, themost excellent man, never deserves to be lamented."

2-44-5,"Sita, who was habituated to comforts, even after knowing the pain whatsoever, isaccompanying your virtuous- soled son."""
2-44-6,"What has not been secured by your capable son, who is rich in virtue and isengrossed in the vow of truthfulness, and the banner of whose fame flutters though out theworld?"

2-45-1,"The people devoted to the high- soled Rama of unfailing bravery accompanied him onhis way to the forest for exile."
2-45-2,"When the king was forced (in the interests of his son) to turn back, the group offriends who were following Rama's chariot did not return."
2-45-3,"Rama who enjoyed great celebrity and who was richly endowed with every virtue,resembling the full moon, had indeed become the favorite for the people living in Ayodhya."
2-45-4,"Despite the entreaties of the people of his own, Rama(the scion of the Kakutstha),in order to honor his father's vow; proceeded towards the forest."
2-45-5,"Fondly gazing on the people as though drinking with his eyes, Rama lovingly spoke(as follows) as though they were his own children:"
2-45-6,"The respect and affection that has been bestowed upon me by you (the residents ofAyodhya) may for my satisfaction be bestowed in a special measure on Bharata."
2-45-7,"Bharata who enhances the delight of Kaikeyi and who possesses excellent conduct,will indeed do pleasing and beneficial things to you appropriately."
2-45-8,"Bharata who is matured in knowledge but young in age, who is gentle but endowedwith virility and virtue, will become your worthy master who can dispel your fears"
2-45-9,"Bharata who is endowed with royal virtues is being marked as the prince. Further,king's command is to be carried out by me and the rest of you."
2-45-10,"If you desire to please me, see that the king does not suffer agony when I havegone to forest for exile"
2-45-11,"The more Rama the son of Dasaratha, showed himself to be faithful to his duty, themore the people wished to have him as their master """
2-45-12,"Rama accompanied by son of Sumitra, drew the people of the city, who were weepingpiteously, after him as if tied and pulled with cords."
2-45-13,"Those brahmanas, who were triply revered for their learning, their age and theirspirituality, their heads shaking with advanced years, cried out :"
2-45-14,"Oh Noble Steeds, of speedy breed! You who are carrying Rama, do come back! Do notproceed! Be friendly to your master (since by taking Rama against our wishes, you will be doing adisservice to him)"
2-45-15,"Indeed all things, which are endowed with ears, more so horses, stand appraised ofour entreaty. Therefore, you return."
2-45-16,"That hero of the pure soul, of virtuous and auspicious firm resolve, that master,deserves to be brought back to the city and not to be taken to the forest."
2-45-17,"Seeing those aged brahmanas uttering those painful words, Rama quickly got down fromthe chariot."
2-45-18,"Rama with Sita and Lakshmana, taking close strides, proceeded on foot towards theforest."
2-45-19,"That Rama who was affectionate in his disposition and had compassion in his eyes,could not abandon those brahmanas walking on foot, far behind the chariot."
2-45-20,"Perceiving Rama still going towards the forest, those brahmanas perplexed in mindand greatly distressed, spoke the following words :"
2-45-21,"The whole of this brahmana community is following you, devoted (as you are) to thebrahmanas. See, they are bearing the sacred fires on their shoulders"
2-45-22,"Look at these canopies (obtained by us while observing Vajpeya sacrifice*)accompanying our backs like clouds at the end of the rainy season"

2-45-25,"We will carry the Vedas in our hearts as our excellent treasure and our wives toowill remain at home, protected by their character"
2-45-26,"We shall not revoke our decision. Our mind is fully determined to go along with you(to the forest). If you do not pay attention to piety, what being will remain devoted to the pathof virtue?"
2-45-27," Oh, prince of resolute conduct! We entreat you by our heads having gray hair likethe white color of the swans, that are soiled with dust as a result of their falling on the ground(in the course of our prostration to you) (pray) turn back."
2-45-28,"Sacrifices have been commenced by many of those Brahmanas that have come here.Their completion, oh dear child, depends on your return"
2-45-29,"Beings both animate and inanimate, Oh, Rama, are indeed devoted to you. Showaffection to those devotees, who entreat you to return."
2-45-30,"The trees held by their roots, unable to accompany you, seen to be weeping,hump-backed by the force of wind"
2-45-31,"Birds too, which sit motionless and are unable to go out in search of food andwhich remain fixed at one spot on trees, are supplicating you to return, compassionate as you areto all created beings"
2-45-32,"While those brahmanas were crying thus with a view to persuading Rama to return, theriver Tamasa appeared there, as though retarding the progress of Rama """
2-45-33,"Thereafter Sumantra the charioteer too released the horses, tired as they were, fromthe chariot and quickly making them roll, allowed them to graze not very far from the (bank of)Tamasa once they had drunk water and had their body washed in the river."""
2-46-1,"Then Rama taking his position at the banks of Tamasa river and looking at Sita,spoke to Lakshmana as follows :"
2-46-2,"Oh, Lakshmana! We have been sent to the forest. Today is the first night of ourresidence in the forest .You ought not feel anxious. May all be well with you!"
2-46-3,"Look here: As the animals and birds are returning to their respective abodesseeking for shelter, the desolate woods seem to be crying from all sides"
2-46-4,"Now, the city of Ayodhya the capital of my father with its men and women willlament about us that have departed (to the forest). There is no doubt"
2-46-5,"Oh, tiger among men! The citizens (of Ayodhya) are indeed having affection to theking no less than to you and myself, as also to Bharata and Satrughna, for many of ourvirtues."
2-46-6,"I feel repented for my father and my illustrious mother. I fear whether they willbecome even blind, by weeping incessantly."
2-46-7,"Bharata, the virtuous man, can indeed console my father and mother by his kindwords."
2-46-8,"Oh,Lakshmana! Thinking of Bharata's kindness again and again, I do not grieve forour father and mother"
2-46-9,"Oh, Lakshmana, tiger among men! You have done well by accompanying me, asotherwise, a help would have to be sought for by me for protecting Seetha"
2-46-10," Oh, Lakshmana! I shall live on water alone tonight. Though there are various kindsof wild fruits and roots, this is indeed a liking for me"
2-46-11,"Thus telling Lakshmana, Rama spoke also to Sumantra as follows: ""Oh, gentle man!Attend to the horses carefully."""
2-46-12,"The sun having completely set, Sumantra tied up the horses, supplied them withabundant grass and immediately stood nearest (to Rama)."
2-46-13,"Having worshipped the beautiful evening twilight and having seen the night comenearer, Sumantra along with Lakshmana made the bed for Rama."
2-46-14,"Seeing that bed made of leaves of a tree on the bank of Tamasa river with the helpof Lakshmana, Rama along with his wife laid down on it."
2-46-15,"Seeing that brother sleeping along with his wife, Lakshmana narrated Rama's variousvirtues to Sumantra."
2-46-16,"WhileLakshmana was thus recounting Rama's excellences to Sumantra, keeping awakethat whole night at the bank of Tamasa river, the sun rose."
2-46-17,"At a good distance from Tamasa river, whose banks were crowded with herds of cows,Rama passed that night there with the citizens."
2-46-18,"Getting up from the bed and seeing those citizens, Rama with an extraordinarysplendor, spoke to his brother, Lakshmana who was endowed with auspicious bodily marks:"
2-46-19,"Observe, Oh Lakshmana, the citizens full of longing for us, unmindful even of theirhomes, sleeping together at the roots of trees, Oh, the son of Sumitra!"
2-46-20,"From the way in which these citizens are making coercion to take us back (toAyodhya), it seems they will even lay down their lives, but in no case would give up theirresolve"
2-46-21,"Till which time the citizens are asleep, within that time, let us quickly mount thechariot and take a route which has no fear from any quarter"
2-46-22,"From this the citizens of Ayodhya (the ancient capital of Ikshvaku), who arelonging for me, may not sleep as of now, at the roots of trees again and again"
2-46-23,"The residents of city should indeed be made free of their suffering brought aboutby (citizens) themselves, by the sons of their rulers. The citizens should on no account beburdened with hardship caused by (princes) them selves as is our case."
2-46-24,"Lakshmana replied as follows to Rama, who is standing firm like righteousnesspersonified: ""Oh, wise brother! What you say is agreeable to me. (Pray) ascend the chariotquickly"""
2-46-25,"Then, the glorious Rama spoke to the charioteer as follows: ""Oh, capable man! Keepthe chariot ready. I shall proceed to the forest. Let us go quickly from here."""
2-46-26,"Then, Sumantra quickly fastened the chariot to its excellent horses and thereaftersubmitted with joined palms to Rama (as follows):"
2-46-27,"Oh, mighty armed prince! Your chariot is kept ready. You ascend it along with Sitaand with Lakshmana, Oh jewel among car-warriors! May prosperity attend you"
2-46-28,"Rama mounted the chariot with all necessaries (like bow, armor, quiver, spade,basket, and so on) and crossed the swift flowing Tamasa river, thickly set with whirl- pools."
2-46-29,"Having duly crossed the stream, the glorious Rama the mighty armed reached a greatroad free from obstacles and safe even for those who are apprehensive of danger."
2-46-30,"In order to elude the citizens, Rama spoke to Sumantra as follows: ""Oh, charioteer!You mount the chariot and go northward. Proceed for a while quickly and bring back the chariotagain. Remaining careful, do it in such a way that the citizens may not be able to locate me"""
2-46-31,"Hearing Rama's advice, the charioteer made a round of the chariot as he wassuggested and on returning, reported to Rama about the arrival of the chariot."
2-46-32,"Then, Rama and Lakshmana(the promoters of the race of Raghu) along with Sitaascended the chariot yoked together. The charioteer urged the horses along the route by which theycan reach a grove suited to the practice of austerities."
2-46-33,"However, Sumantra placed that chariot by facing it to the north, for he saw omensauspicious for journey (in that quarter). Rama (son of Dasaratha) the mighty car-warrior, alongwith the charioteer mounted the chariot and proceeded to the forest."
2-47-1,"As the night was beginning to become dawn, those citizens relinquished by Raghavawere perplexed with grief and became motionless."
2-47-2,"Made miserable with tears born of anguish and agony, they could not notice even aglimmer of Rama, though casting their eyes everywhere."
2-47-3,"Their faces distorted with sorrow, deprived as they were of sagacious Rama andtherefore non-pulsed, the citizens broke into piteous exclamations, saying:-"
2-47-4,"Cursed be to that slumber, rendered unconscious, by which we could not behold todaythat mighty armed Rama with a broad chest."
2-47-5,"How that Rama the strong armed, whose actions are never ineffectual, leave forexile, abandoning his devoted citizens?"
2-47-6,"How did the chief of Raghus, who protected us ever, like a father the children bornof his loins, could proceed to the forest, leaving us?"
2-47-7,"Let us have recourse to death here itself, or definitely set out for a grandjourney ( to the north with a resolve to die). For what purpose can life be good for us, separatedas we are from Rama?"
2-47-8," Or there are a number of big dry logs of wood here. Lighting a funeral fire out ofthem, let us all enter the fire."
2-47-9,"What shall we say to our fellow citizens? �The great armed Rama who is free fromegoism and who speaks kindly ( to all ) has been conveyed to the forest by us!' How can we sayso?"
2-47-10,"Seeing us returning without Rama, that city of Ayodhya, already desolate, will withits women, children and the aged, become even deeply cheerless."
2-47-11,"Having left the city thus with that hero, the conqueror of one's own self, how canwe look on that city again without him?"
2-47-12,"Uplifting their arms , those men stricken with anguish, like cows bereft of theircalves, lamented in various ways as above."
2-47-13,"Then, proceeding to some distance along the tracks for a while, they wereoverwhelmed with great despair again due to sudden disappearance of tracks."
2-47-14,"The good-natured citizens, due to disappearance of the tracks of the chariot,returned to Ayodhya, saying thus, "" How is it? What shall we do? We are afflicted byprovidence"""
2-47-15,"Therafter, all of them with aggrieved hearts went to the city of Ayodhya, which wascomprising of virtuous people with distress, by the same path on which they had come."
2-47-16,"Beholding the city, they shed tears through their eyes stricken as they were ingrief , their minds distressed through cheerlessness."
2-47-17,"Bereft of Rama, the aforesaid city of Ayodhya was not any more enchanting than ariver whose snakes were uplifted from its pool by Garuda."
2-47-18,"As the sky without the moon or the sea without the water, these disconcerted menbeheld the city from which all joy had fled."
2-47-19,"Entering their houses full of abundant riches with uneasiness, the citizens couldnot distinguish between their own people and others, even though being looked at, stricken as theywere with grief, their joy having altogether extinguished."
2-48-1,"The lives of those citizens, who had returned dejected and cheerless in this wayafter accompanying Rama were greatly hurt, having their eyes filled with tears afflicted withgrief, longing to give up their lives and appeared as though they were dead."
2-48-2,"Reaching each his own house, all of them surrounded by their sons and wife, shedtears, their faces being covered by them."
2-48-3,"None was either delightful or merry. Merchants no longer exhibited their wares, northeir merchandise looked charming. Those in charge of home did not attend to cooking."
2-48-4,"None was delightful for instance on finding out a lost fortune, or on getting richesin abundance. No mother did rejoice even on obtaining a son born for the first time."
2-48-5,"Oppressed with sorrow and weeping, women in every house heaped reproaches on theirhusbands who came home, with words as sharp as pricks of the goad which attack an elephant."
2-48-6,"What purpose of theirs who do not see Rama, will be served by their dwellings, wifeor wealth or sons or pleasures even?"
2-48-7,"Lakshmana alone is a good man in this world, who was accompanying Rama belonging toKakutstha dynasty, along with Sita ,duly rendering service to them in the forest."""
2-48-8,"Fortunate too are the rivers; lotus ponds and lakes for bathing in whose sacredwaters Rama entered into."
2-48-9,"Forests with beautiful row of trees, tracks of land abounding in water, rivers andmountains with alluring peaks will bring splendor to Rama."
2-48-10,"Any mountain or forest which Rama will visit, will not fail to respect him like abeloved guest who has arrived."
2-48-11,"Plants with many -colored flowers as their chaplets, bearing copious clusters ofblossoms full of bees exhibit themselves at Rama."
2-48-12,"Even in unseasonable ness, mountains in compassion will present principal flowersand fruits to Rama, on his arrival."
2-48-13,"Mountains will show various wonderful waterfalls again and again, duly streamingforth uncontaminated waters."
2-48-14,"Trees on apex of mountains will enrapture Rama. Where there is Rama, there isneither fear nor humiliation."
2-48-15,"That Rama the son of Dasaratha, the hero and the mighty armed will come to our viewnot far from us. Let us run after him."
2-48-16,"The shelter of the feet of the lord and the high-souled Rama is in itself a joy.Rama indeed is the protector of all of us, he the refuge and our supreme asylum "
2-48-17,"We shall serve Sita; while you attend on Rama. Thus, the citizen's wives,afflicted with agony, spoke in so many words to their husbands."
2-48-18,"Rama will secure the needs and interests of yours in the forest, while Sita will dothe same thing with regard to us womenfolk."
2-48-19,"Who will be highly pleased with this residence in the city, which is apprehensible,with anxious people in it and not being a pleasant spot with unsettled minds?"
2-48-20,"If it were to be the rule of Kaikeyi, it will not be in consonance withrighteousness, with no protector and indeed with no use for our lives, mush less for our sons andriches."
2-48-21,"Whom else Kaikeyi will not abandon? --that Kaikeyi, by whom her son and her husbandwere forsaken for the sake of power and who brought disgrace to her family."
2-48-22,"We swear even by our sons that while Kaikeyi is surviving and as long as we live,we will never inhabit this kingdom as Kaikeyi's servants!"
2-48-23,"Who can live happily on having obtained (as one's ruler) that impious woman ofwicked conduct, who banished the son of the king without any pity?"
2-48-24,"The whole of this kingdom, without any leader, having no support and visited bycalamities, will meet with ruin because of Kaikeyi's fault."
2-48-25,"For, Rama having gone into exile, the monarch will not survive and when Dasarathais dead, utter regrets will remain thereafter. It is certain!"
2-48-26,"So, drink poison duly stirred up, since your merits are exhausted and you aremarked out by ill fortune. Otherwise, follow Rama to forest or reach a place where even the name ofKaikeyi may not reach your ears."
2-48-27,"Rama has been sent to exile along with Sita and Lakshmana deceitfully. We have beenhanded over now to Bharata, like the beasts in the hands of a slaughterer."
2-48-28,"Rama, whose face is like the full moon, of dark brown complexion, whose collar-boneis invisible (because of its being covered with flesh), a conqueror of foes, whose arms descend tohis knees, whose eyes resemble lotuses, the elder brother of Lakshmana, who takes initiative inspeaking and expresses with sweetness, truthful of speech and possessed of extra ordinary strength,is benevolent to all, delightfully charming as the moon, that tiger among men, as mighty as anelephant in rut, that great car-warrior, will surely adorn the woods, while roaming throughthem.."
2-48-29,"Those wives of citizens in the city of Ayodhya, lamenting as aforesaid, beganweeping, as though fear has cropped up for a forth-coming death."
2-48-30,"The sun sank below the horizon and the night fell, while the women in the houseswere weeping in that manner about Rama."
2-48-31,"The city of Ayodhya, in which the kindling of fires had ceased and the chanting ofVedas and narration of sacred stories died out, looked as though it was coated with darkness atthat time."
2-48-32,"The city of Ayodhya, in which the business of the trading class had come to astand-still, in which joy had been faded out, which had become (now) support less, looked dim asthough stars had disappeared in the sky."
2-48-33,"The women whose minds became sick on account of Rama, as one would feel on one's ownson or brother having been sent into exile, cried miserably expressing their grief in various ways.To them, Rama was dearer than their very sons!"
2-48-34,"That city of Ayodhya, in which singing, rejoicing, dancing and instrumental musichad been completely set at rest, when jpy had departed forever and whose shops had been closed,looked at that time like a grat ocean whose waters had dried up."
2-49-1,"Rama the tiger among men, revolving in his mind the command of his father, covered along distance during the rest of the night."
2-49-2,"While Rama was traveling with the same alacrity, that delightful night passed away.Having worshipped the blissful morning twilight, he passed beyond the boundary of that country."
2-49-3,"Seeing villages, whose outskirts have been tilled and the woodlands laden withblossoms and hearing as follows the words of men dwelling together in the midst of the village,Rama proceeded apace in those excellent horses as though slowly (engrossed as he was in enjoyingthe sights)."
2-49-4,"Woe unto the king Dasaratha who fell into the clutches of concupiscence. Alas!Kaikeyi the cruel and the sinful one now is still engaged in a cruel game. She is sending to exilethe prince Rama, the pious man, the great intellectual, the compassionate man and he who subduedthe senses. That hot-tempered Kaikeyi is behaving in a rude manner, transgressing the bounds ofpropriety"
2-49-5,"How Sita the venerable woman, the daughter of Janaka, who was delighted always inhomely comforts can now experience hardships in the forest?"
2-49-6,"What a surprise! The king Dasaratha, having no love for his son, now wants toabandon Rama who is so beloved to the people and is even faultless."
2-49-7,"Hearing these words of people residing in villages and hamlets, Rama the heroicprince of Kosala crossed the boundaries of Kosala state."
2-49-8,"Having crossed the river of auspicious waters called Vedashruti, Rama then stretchedforth, facing the quarter occupied by Sage Agastya."
2-49-9,"After traveling a pretty long time from there, Rama crossed the river Gomati havingbeautiful waters, whose banks were adorned with cows and which headed towards the sea."
2-49-10,"Reaching the other bank of Gomati river with the help of the swift moving horses,Rama crossed the river called Syandika which had resounded with howls of peacocks and swans."
2-49-11,"The said Rama showed to Sita the land (of Kosala, the southern boundary of which wasdefined by Syandika river)given long ago by the king Manu to Ikshvaku and which was bounded by manyterritories."
2-49-12,"The glorious Rama, the foremost among men, whose voice resembled the cackling of aswan in rut, addressed the charioteer with great affection, in the words ""Oh, charioteer!"" andspoke as follows :"
2-49-13,"When, coming back and united with my mother and father, shall I roam hunting in theforest, bordering on Sarayu river and laden with blossoms?"
2-49-14,"I do not hanker much after hunting in the woodlands bordering on Sarayu river. Infact it is a delightful spot, made much of in the world by hosts of royal sages. Hunting in theforest is indeed for gratification of royal sages in this world. At times; the bow- men adopted it.But I do not long for it excessively."
2-49-15,"Uttering in sweet voice to the charioteer on various topics dearer to him, Ramaadvanced thus along that route."
2-50-1,"Having traveled the extensive and beautiful Kosala territory and standing with hisface turned towards Ayodhya, the wise Rama with joined palms spoke the following words:"
2-50-2,"I bid farewell to you, Oh best of the cities, carefully protected by Dasaratha bornin Kakutstha dynasty, as well as of the deities who protect you and dwell in you."
2-50-3,"After getting relieved from exile in the forest and thus freed from the debt to theemperor, I shall see you again, duly getting united with my mother and father."
2-50-4,"Lifting his right arm and wearing a woeful look, his face covered with tears, Ramapossessing lovely reddish eyes, spoke them to the people hailing from the countryside.(as follows):"
2-50-5,"Mercy and compassion according to my worth (in your view) have been shown to me byyou. Keeping agony for a long time is undesirable. Let each return to accomplish your desiredobject(attending to your house-hold work)!"
2-50-6,"Respectfully saluting the high soled prince and going round him clockwise (as a markof reverence), those men stood rooted here and there, wailing frightfully."
2-50-7,"While they were lamenting thus unceasingly, Rama passed beyond their sight, as thesun sinks out of view at nightfall."
2-50-8,"Then Rama, a tiger among men, in his chariot, crossed Kosala territory, which wasrich in grain and treasure, inhabited by men given to charity, benevolent and free from everydanger, pleasing, full of temples and sacrificial stakes, adorned with gardens and mango-orchards,intersected by ponds full of water, populated by contented and well nourished people, abounded inherds of cows which deserved to be seen by all kings and which re-echoed to the chanting ofreligious texts."
2-50-9,"Rama, the best among the resolute, moved into the middle of a happy and prosperouskingdom, abounding in lovely gardens and fit to be enjoyed by kings."
2-50-10,"There, Rama beheld the celestial and lovely river of Ganga with its treetributaries, carrying clear waters without green moss and frequented by sages."
2-50-11,"The River Ganga was adorned with splendid hermitages within easy distance from oneanother, with pools overflowing with water, visited at suitable hours by celestial nymphs thrillingwith rapture."
2-50-12,"The blessed river was graced by gods and demons, Gandharvas(celestial musicians) andkinnaras and was constantly visited by consorts of Nagas and Gandharvas."
2-50-13,"The well known river was hemmed in by hills serving as the play- ground of hundredsof celestials and embellished with hundreds of celestial gardens; it coursed through the heavensfor the benefit of gods and which in heaven was named ""The stream of Golden Lotuses""."
2-50-14,"The holy river, the sound of whose clashing waves and its striking with rocksresembled a deep laughter, having a bright smile as white as a foam, its waters reduced at someplaces to the shape of a maiden's plaited locks, was rendered beautiful at some places by whirlpools."
2-50-15,"At some places, its waters were still and deep. At some places, they were disturbedwith violent agitation. At some places, they made a deep roaring sound. At some places, they werehaving a terrific noise"
2-50-16,"Hosts of gods took a dip into its water .It was adorned by white lotuses. It washemmed in, with expanse of small islands and at some places, lined with white sands."
2-50-17,"The river was rendered resonant by swans and cranes, was graced with cackling ofChakrawaka** birds and other birds which are in rut all through the year kept hovering on itswater."
2-50-18,"At some places the river was adorned with trees growing on its banks encircling likegarlands, at some places crowded with thick cluster of lotuses."
2-50-19,"At some places, it was graced with beds of water lilies in the form of buds and atsome places, it was reddened with the pollen of numerous flowers, as though excited withpassion."
2-50-20,"Having every aggregation of dirt removed, the river presented a spotlessly clearappearance like a crystal. The interior of the forest was reddened noisy again and again by theelephants guarding the quarters, by the ruttiest wild elephants and the elephants of excellentbreed used for riding by gods."
2-50-21,"Surrounded by fruits and flowers and tender leaves, shrubs and birds, it looked likea young woman artistically decked with the best of jewels. The river was infested with dolphins,crocodiles and snakes."
2-50-22,"Rama, the mighty armed, reached the river Ganga, which is devoid of sins and whichdispels all sins, which had fallen from the mass of matted hair of Lord Shankara through thespiritual power of Emperor Bhagiratha, which is rendered noisy by cranes and herons, which is aconsort of the ocean and which is in the vicinity of Sringaverapura(the modern Singraur)."
2-50-23,"Beholding the river Ganga with its waves covering whirlpools, Rama the great warriorsaid to Sumantra the charioteer as follows: ""We shall halt here itself today."""
2-50-24,"Oh, charioteer! Not far from the river stands this very large sacred fig tree withits many flowers and shoots. We shall stay here itself."
2-50-25,"I shall see (from here) the excellent river Ganga, which is auspicious and whosewaters deserve to be respected by gods, men, Gandharvas, beasts, reptiles and birds ."
2-50-26,"Saying �so be it' and nothing more to Rama, Lakshmana and Sumantra too then directedthe horses to that sacred fig tree."
2-50-27,"Rama, the delight of Ikshvaku dynasty, reached that beautiful tree and got down fromthe chariot along with Sita and Lakshmana."
2-50-28,"Sumantra too dismounted from the chariot, unyoked the superb horses after which withjoined palms, he seated himself near Rama at the foot of the tree."
2-50-29,"There, a king named Guha was Rama's friend dear to him as his own life. He wasNishada by birth, a strong man and well known as a ruler of Nishadas."
2-50-30,"Hearing of Rama the tiger among men having come to his territory, he approached theprince, escorted by elderly ministers and relatives."
2-50-31,"Seeing from a distance the king of Nishada coming, Rama along with Lakshmanathereupon went forth to meet Guha."
2-50-32,"Closely embracing Rama, Guha who felt disturbed, spoke to him, ""This city too is asmuch as Ayodhya to you. What can I do for you? Oh mighty armed! Who indeed will get such a lovelyguest?"""
2-50-33,"Having brought pristine cooked rice of excellent quality and other dishes of variouskinds, he then quickly offered him water to wash his hands and spoke as follows:"
2-50-34,"Welcome to you, Oh, mighty armed! All this land is yours. We are your servants. Youare the Lord. Rule over our kingdom in an efficient way."
2-50-35,"Here have arrived various kinds of dishes, drinks and syrups as also excellent beds(for you to sleep on) and food for your horses"
2-50-36,"To Guha who was speaking as aforesaid, Rama replied thus: ""We stand honored by you,by your very visit to us on foot, as well as your show of affection and are pleased with you"""
2-50-37,"Pressing gently with his muscular arms, Rama spoke these words: "" Oh, Guha! Thankheaven that I am seeing you in good health with your relatives. Is all well with the kingdom, theallies and the treasure?"""
2-50-38,"I know your affection by which all this is extensively well arranged by you. But Iam not in a position indeed to accept it."
2-50-39,"Know me as under a vow to be an ascetic, wearing the robes of bark and deerskin andby piety, I am determined to live in the forest by eating roots and fruits only."
2-50-40,"I desire nothing but a little forage for the horses. By being provided with thismuch at the present moment, I shall be duly satisfied by you."
2-50-41,"These horses were cherished by the king Dasaratha, my father. I shall feel honoredby these horses being duly fed."
2-50-42,"Then Guha on that spot commanded his men as follows: ""Let water for drinking andforage be supplied promptly to horses"""
2-50-43,"Having worshipped the evening twilight appearing in the west, with an upper garmentmade of bark(on his person); Rama then took for food only water brought by Lakshmana himself."
2-50-44,"Having washed the feet of Rama who was lying on the ground along with his consort,Lakshmana then came and stood near a tree."
2-50-45,"Guha too along with the charioteer conversed with Lakshmana and thereafter wieldinga bow; alertly kept a vigil over Rama."
2-50-46,"The illustrious, lofty minded and the high-soled son of Dasaratha, who had neverseen suffering and who deserved all comforts, remained lying on the ground thereafter, while thatlong night passed away."
2-51-1,"Distressed with anguish (to see Rama and Sita lying on the ground) Guha said toLakshmana, the scion of Raghu, who kept awake, through sincere love, for the protection of hisbrother Rama."
2-51-2,"Here is a comfortable bed made for you, my friend! Relax well comfortably on it,Oh, prince!"
2-51-3,"All of us are habituated to hardships. You are habituated to comforts. We shallkeep awake this night, for the protection of Rama"
2-51-4,"For, none is dearer to me than Rama in this world. I speak the truth and swear toyou by truth."
2-51-5,"I hope to acquire abundant acclaim and supreme merit in this world as also fullreward of wealth, by the sole grace of Rama"
2-51-6,"As such, I along with my kindred, shall protect my dear friend Rama who is reposingwith Sita in every way, with bow in hand."
2-51-7,"Nothing is indeed unknown in this forest to me, where I wander continually. We canable to withstand even a vast army too, comprising of four parts (elephants, chariots, cavalry, andinfantry)."
2-51-8,"Then, Lakshmana replied to Guha as follows: ""Oh, sinless Guha! Being protected byyou, who keep your duty alone in view, all of us are fearless in this land."""
2-51-9,"When Rama, the son of Dasaratha is lying on the ground with Sita, how is itpossible for me to sleep or to enjoy the pleasures of life?"
2-51-10,"See that Rama, who cannot be vanquished in combat even by the gods and demonscombined, now sleeping profoundly on the grass along with Sita."
2-51-11,"When Rama- who is endowed with similar characteristics as Dasaratha, uniquelybeloved, the son obtained by Dasaratha by virtue of his chanting of several sacred texts andausterities and by various undertakings (in the form of sacrificial performances) has gone toexile, the king will not live long and the earth will become surely widowed forthwith."
2-51-12,"Having cried out in a high-pitched tone, the women having exhausted, will havefallen silent and I am sure that a profound stillness reigns in the palace."
2-51-13,"I do not expect Kausalya, Dasaratha and my mother all of them to remain alive forthis night."
2-51-14,"By looking forward to meet Satrughna, my mother might even stay alive. But it willbe painful if Kausalya who has given birth to a heroic son, dies."
2-51-15,"That city of Ayodhya, filled with devoted people, hitherto a source of joy and whichbrought pleasure to the world, when seized with agony over the king's death, will perish."
2-51-16,"How, in the absence of his magnanimous and the first born son, will the vital airsin the body of the generous king be maintained?"
2-51-17,"After the death of king, Kausalya will die. My mother also will die thereafter."
2-51-18,"Having failed to install Rama in the kingdom, failed forever, which was the mostcherished wish of his heart, my father will leave this world."
2-51-19,"Those who are fortunate will consecrate our deceased father and the king in thecourse of all funeral rites, when the hour has struck."
2-51-20,"People will joyfully move in the capital belonging to my father and the city withits quadrangular places allocated at lovely sites, and well- aligned roads, rich in mansions ofwell-to-do men, temples and royal palaces adorned with the foremost of courtesans, its chariotshorses and elephants that obstruct the roads, the musical instruments that resound there- full ofall blessings and crowded with merry and well fed men, well- provided with gardens and royal parksand bright with festivities carried on under the patronage of associations."
2-51-21,"Will Dasaratha remain alive? After returning from exile, can we see the high-soledking Dasaratha of noble vows again?"
2-51-22,"Can we safely return to Ayodhya, after completion of the exile in the forest alongwith Rama who is faithful to his promises?"
2-51-23,"While the high-soled Lakshmana thus lamenting, stood on ground, afflicted withanguish as he was, that night rolled away."
2-51-24,"While Lakshmana (son of Dasaratha), who was concerned with the welfare of thepeople; was thus speaking the truth out of his affection for his elder brother (Rama), Guha,overcome with agony and oppressed with adversity shed tears like an elephant tormented withfever."
2-52-1,"That night having given way to dawn, the illustrious Rama with a broad chest spoke(as follows) to Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra and who was endowed with auspicious signs :"
2-52-2,"Oh, dear brother! This is the hour of sunrise. The auspicious night has departed.That bird of dark plumage, the cuckoo, is singing."
2-52-3,"Oh, good brother! Hear the cries of peacocks resounding in the forest. Let us crossthe swift-flowing Ganga River that gushes to the sea."
2-52-4,"Lakshmana, the delight of his friends, having understood the words of Rama, calledGuha as well as Sumantra and stood in front of his brother."
2-52-5,"Hearing the command of Rama, Guha quickly received it, invited his ministers andspoke to them as follows:"
2-52-6,"Let a beautiful boat that is solidly constructed, sails well and a helmsman in it,be brought to the bank to carry this hero across!"
2-52-7,"Hearing that command, the chief minister of King Guha brought a charming boat to thebank and reported the matter to Guha."
2-52-8,"Then, Guha with folded hands spoke to Rama as follows: ""Oh, Lord! Here, the boat hasarrived. What more can I do for you?"""
2-52-9,"Oh, tiger among men! Oh, Rama resembling a son of divinity! Here is the boat foryou to cross the river, which flows into the sea. Oh, virtuous one! (Pray) get into it."
2-52-10,"Then, Rama with great splendor, spoke to Guha as follows: ""My desire has beenaccomplished by you. Let us embark with all speed."""
2-52-11,"Having equipped themselves with a quiver each with arrows, fastening their swordsand armed with their bows, Rama and Lakshmana, with Sita, proceeded towards the river of Ganga."
2-52-12,"Sumantra joining his palms in humility, approached Rama who knew what is right andsaid, ""What shall I do?"""
2-52-13,"Touching Sumantra with his auspicious right hand, Rama then said: ""Oh, Sumantra!Return quickly to the king's presence and be attentive in serving him."""
2-52-14,"Go now, that your service to me has been completed. Abandoning the chariot, I shallgo on foot to the mighty forest, Rama said."
2-52-15,"Finding himself dismissed, Sumantra the charioteer was distressed and spoke to Rama,the tiger among men, as follows:"
2-52-16,"None in the world has had to suffer such a fate as yourself; that you should haveto dwell in the forest with your brother and your consort as if you were an ordinary man!"
2-52-17,"I think that there is no reward in leading a life of religious student or instudying religious scriptures or even in cultivating tenderness and straight forwardness, whenadversity has come to you."
2-52-18,"Oh, heroic Rama! Living in the forest along with Sita and your brother, you willobtain the same position as one who has conquered the three worlds."
2-52-19,"Oh, Rama! We are actually ruined, in that, disappointed in our hopes by you too, weshall fall under the sway of Kaikeyi the sinful woman and reap the suffering."
2-52-20,"Sumantra the charioteer thus speaking, wept for a long time, stricken with grief,seeing Rama, equal to his soul, departing to a distance."
2-52-21,"Then, Rama again and again spoke these sweet words as follows to that charioteer,whose tears got dried up and who had sipped some water and got himself purified:"
2-52-22,"I do not see any one who is as great a friend of the Ikshvakus as you are. (Pray)act in such a way that king Dasaratha may not lament about me"
2-52-23,"The king, his mind afflicted with grief, is aged as well. He is pressed down by aburden of passion. Hence, I tell you this."
2-52-24,"What so ever act that high-soled emperor may enjoin you to do, with intent tooblige the desire of Kaikeyi, it is to be done unhesitatingly."
2-52-25,"The kings indeed rule the states with this end in view that their will may not befrustrated in any undertaking."
2-52-26,"Oh, Sumantra! Carry out everything in such a way that the said emperor neitherfinds it unpleasing nor gets tormented by grief."
2-52-27,"Only after performing respectful salutation to the old and venerable king, who hasnever known suffering and who has subdued his senses, you tell these words to him on mybehalf."
2-52-28,"Indeed neither I nor Lakshmana and Sita grieve for having moved from Ayodhya orthat we are going to dwell in a forest."
2-52-29,"After completing fourteen years, you will once more see Lakshmana, myself and Sitatoo returned apace from the forest."
2-52-30,"Oh,Sumantra! This is what you should say to the king, my mother, all other queensand Kaikeyi. Tell Kausalya again and again that I am keeping good health. Thereafter, conveysalutations at her feet on behalf of Sita as well as myself and Lakshmana the faithful man."
2-52-31,"Tell our salutations to the emperor too. Bring Bharata quickly. After his arrival,Bharata may be installed in the position, as desired by the king."
2-52-32,"When you embrace Bharata and install him in the office of the Prince Regent, theagony caused by the repentance felt by you on our account will not overpower you."
2-52-33,"Bharata too is to be told thus: Treat without distinction all your mothers withthe same regard as you behave towards the king."""
2-52-34,"As is your affection for Kaikeyi, so let it be for Sumitra and also the divineKausalya, my mother"
2-52-35,"If you accept the princely kingdom with an intent to please our father, it will bepossible for you to enhance happiness in both the worlds (in this world and the next)."
2-52-36,"Sumantra, who was being sent back by Rama, was agonized with grief after hearing thewhole of that discourse and affectionately spoke to Rama as follows:"
2-52-37,"If I spoke to you fearlessly in a friendly tone without following courteousness,you ought to forgive my mode of expression, considering me as your devotee"
2-52-38,"How indeed can I return without you to that city, which through separation fromyou, has been reduced to the state of a mother stricken with grief due to separation from herson"
2-52-39,"By seeing my chariot on that day even with Rama in it, the people were lamenting somuch. Now, if they see the chariot without Rama the city of Ayodhya will even be brokenasunder."
2-52-40,"The city will be plunged in misery, like an army in which its commander is lost ina combat with the charioteer alone surviving, on seeing this chariot without you."
2-52-41,"Thinking of you, who though residing far away are established foremost in theirminds, the people of Ayodhya must have been deprived of their food today."
2-52-42,"The great perplexity that ensued, on the occasion of your exile, among the people(of Ayodhya), whose minds were depressed through grief on your account, was witnessed by youindeed, Oh, Rama!"
2-52-43,"The cry of distress raised by the citizens (of Ayodhya) will be increased ahundred-fold, when they see me with an empty chariot."
2-52-44,"Further, shall I say to the queen Kausalya as follows: - �Your son, Rama has beentaken by me to the house of his maternal uncle, do not grieve'."
2-52-45,"I cannot tell such words too which are untrue. How can I tell, �I abandoned yourson in the forest', which words are true but unkind?"
2-52-46,"How will the excellent horses obedient to me, which carried yourself, Sita andLakshmana, draw the chariot bereft of you?"
2-52-47,"Oh, the faultless Rama! For this reason, I cannot go back to Ayodhya. (Pray) permitme to accompany you to the forest."
2-52-48,"If you leave me even though I solicit you to take me with you, I shall enter a firewith chariot and all, here itself the moment I am forsaken by you"
2-52-49,"Oh, Rama! With the help of the chariot, I shall ward off those animals in theforest, which create obstacles to your austerities."
2-52-50,"The pleasure of driving your chariot has been obtained by me because of you and itis through you that I seek the happiness that comes in dwelling in a forest."
2-52-51,"Be graceful. I desire to become your close associate in the forest. I wish to hearyour loving assent with the words �be my close associate!"
2-52-52,"Oh, hero! If these horses too can render service to you, they can attain a supremeabode."
2-52-53,"'-""By all means, I am leaving for good, Ayodhya or even heaven. Dwelling in theforest, with my head bent low, I shall render service to you."""
2-52-54,"As a doer of wicked deeds cannot enter Amaravati, the capital of Devendra, so alsoI cannot enter Ayodhya without you."
2-52-55,"This is indeed my desire that after reaching the end of your exile, I may take youback to the city of Ayodhya in this very chariot."
2-52-56,"So long as I am with you together in the forest, fourteen years will slip awaymomentarily. Otherwise than this, they will multiply a hundred- fold."
2-52-57,"Oh, prince, who are so fond of your dependents! You ought not abandon me, yourdevoted servant, established in the path followed by the son of his master and (always)keepingwithin bounds."
2-52-58,"Rama, who was compassionate towards his dependents, spoke as follows to Sumantra,who was miserably entreating him again and again in many modes."
2-52-59,"Oh, charioteer so fond of your master! I know your excellent devotion to me. Hearwherefore I send you from here to the city of Ayodhya."
2-52-60,"Seeing you, returning to Ayodhya, Kaikeyi, my younger mother will get the proofthat Rama has gone to the forest."
2-52-61,"Having completely satisfied, about me having gone to forest, Kaikeyi will leave herstrong suspicion that the virtuous king may be a person who speaks untruth."
2-52-62,"This is my first priority that my younger mother should get the extensive kingdom,protected by Bharata and thus ruled by her own son."
2-52-63,"For my pleasure and pleasure of the king, you go along with the chariot to Ayodhyaand inform all the matters that you have been asked to tell each in the way you have been asked todo."
2-52-64,"Having spoken thus to the charioteer, the courageous Rama consoled him again andagain. Then, he spoke the following reasoned words to Guha:"
2-52-65,"Oh, Guha! This stay in the inhabited woods is not proper for me. My stay shoulddefinitely be in a hermitage. Let an action diverted towards that aim be taken"
2-52-66,"I as such, wishing well of my father, Sita as well as Lakshmana and having taken upa discipline to be followed by ascetics, want to proceed further, wearing matted hair. Please bringthe latex of a banyan tree."
2-52-67,"Guha immediately brought that latex to the prince. With that, Rama made matted hairto himself and to Lakshmana."
2-52-68,"Rama, tiger among men who possessed long arms wore the distinguished mark of anascetic (in the shape of matted hair) . Then, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers clad in the bark oftrees and wearing a round mass of matted locks (on their head) looked bright like two asceticsages."
2-52-69,"Having adopted the way of a hermit (temporarily) along with Lakshmana, Rama thenaccepted the vow of an ascetic life and spoke to Guha, his friend as follows:"
2-52-70,"Oh, Guha! Remain vigilant in defense, finance, internal security and publicrelations, for a kingdom is the most difficult one to be protected!"
2-52-71,"Then Rama, who was a delight to Ikshvaku dynasty, bade farewell to Guha and departedquickly, remaining undistracted, along with his consort and together with Lakshmana."
2-52-72,"Seeing the boat on the bank of the river and keen to cross the swift- flowing Ganga,Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows: -"
2-52-73,"Oh, Lakshmana the tiger among men! You get into the boat stationed here unhurriedlyafterwards, having helped Sita the virtuous wife step into it."
2-52-74,"Hearing the command completely of his elder brother, the prudent Lakshmana, by notcounteracting it, made Sita to ascend the boat first and stepped into it afterwards."
2-52-75,"Then, the glorious Rama got into the boat himself. Thereafter, Guha the ruler ofNishadas commanded his kinsfolk to row them across the river."
2-52-76,"After ascending the boat, Rama too of mighty splendor then recited a sacred text(daiviim naavam etc) fit for brahmanas and Kshatriyas alike and conducive to his own good."
2-52-77,"Having sipped water as per scriptures and with extreme delight, Rama with Sita madeobeisance to that river. Lakshmana, of infinite splendor, followed suit."
2-52-78,"Bidding farewell to Guha with his army of men and Sumantra, Rama sat on the boat anddirected the boatmen to move on."
2-52-79,"Propelled by those splendid and vigorous oarsmen, that boat furnished with a pilot,rapidly moved across the water."
2-52-80,"Coming to the middle of Bhagirathi river, the irreproachable Sita with joined palms,spoke as follows to the said river: -"
2-52-81,"Oh, Ganga! Let Rama, the son of the emperor Dasaratha honor his father's commandunder your protection! Having dwelled in the forest in full fourteen years, may he return once moreto your bank with his brother, Lakshmana and myself! Oh, blessed goddess Ganga! Returning safely,with all my desires fulfilled, I shall worship you with great joy."
2-52-82,"You, Oh goddess flowing through three regions (namely heaven, earth and subterraneanregions), include in your basin the realm of Brahma (the outermost of the six spheres envelopingthe earth) and are vividly seen on this terrestrial plane as a consort of the ocean king."""
2-52-83,"Oh, charming goddess! I, Sita, greet you and extol you too. When Rama the tigeramong men safely returns and regains his kingdom, I shall give away a lakh of cows, soft clothingand food to brahmanas with intent to please you."
2-52-84,"Oh, goddess! After reaching back the city of Ayodhya, I shall worship you withthousand pots of spirituous liquor and jellied meat with cooked rice well prepared for the solemnrite."
2-52-85,"I shall worship all deities dwelling on your banks as also sacred spots andsanctuaries."
2-52-86,"Oh, irreproachable goddess! May the sinless Rama (with mighty arms) re-enterAyodhya again from the forest, along with Lakshmana and myself."
2-52-87,"Thus praying to Ganga, the efficient and irreproachable Sita rapidly reached theright bank of the river."
2-52-88,"Reaching the bank and leaving the boat, Rama the best among men and the chastiser offoes proceeded further along with Lakshmana and Sita."
2-52-89,"Then, Rama the mighty armed, spoke to Lakshmana (who heightened the joy of Sumitra)as follows:"
2-52-90,"Security is an inevitable need in a forest, which has unforeseen dangers and isuninhabited, Oh, Lakshmana! Go in front. Let Sita follow you."
2-52-91,"I shall proceed in the rear, protecting you and Sita. Oh, jewel among men! We mustaccord protection here to one another."
2-52-92,"An act which has gone out of hand, whatsoever, cannot indeed be remedied again.Sita will experience the hardship of staying in a forest only from now."
2-52-93,"Today she will enter the forest, where density of people is not seen, which isutterly devoid of fields and gardens, has a rugged surface and is full of stumbles."
2-52-94,"Listening to Rama's words, Lakshmana walked in front. Immediately after Sita, Rama,the delight of Raghu dynasty, advanced."
2-52-95,"Constantly gazing at Rama, who reached soon the other bank of Ganga River, thedistressed Sumantra, his vision having failed due to the long distance and perturbed as he was,shed tears (of grief over separation from Rama)."
2-52-96,"Having crossed the great river, Rama the high-soled, the bestowal of boons, equal inglory with the guardians of spheres, then reached progressively the prosperous and the happy landof Vatsa; which contained rows of beautiful crops."
2-52-97,"Having hunted there four deer, namely Varaaha, Rishya, Prisata; and Mahaaruru (thefour principal species of deer) and taking quickly the portions that were pure, being hungry asthey were, Rama and Lakshmana reached a tree to take rest in the evening."
2-53-1,"Rama, the foremost of those affording happiness to others, reached the aforesaidtree, worshipped the western twilight and spoke to Lakshmana as follows:"
2-53-2,"This might which has got past us today outside the inhabited territory is the firstnight which has passed without Sumantra. You ought not repent over it."
2-53-3,"Remaining free from lassitude, we must both keep awake during nights, from todayLakshmana! The safety and welfare of Sita indeed depend on us two."
2-53-4,"Let us pass this night anyhow, Lakshmana! Let us lie down on the ground, coveringit by straw, leaves and so on, procured by our own hands."
2-53-5,"Streching himself on the bare ground, Rama, who was accustomed to a luxurious coach,uttered the following suitable words to Lakshmana:"
2-53-6,"Assuredly the emperor is sleeping badly tonight, while Kaikeyi, having realized herambitions, ought to feel satisfied."
2-53-7,"Seeing Bharata returned, queen Kaikeyi, I am afraid, may not expel the lives of theemperor for the sake of kingdom."
2-53-8,"Aged and (therefore) helpless, deprived of my presence, what will he do, dominatedas he is by his passion for Kaikeyi and who has fallen into the clutches of Kaikeyi."
2-53-9,"Reflecting on this misfortune of the king and his mental derangement, I deem thatpassion alone is greater than early gain and religious merit."
2-53-10,"what man however deluded, what father on account of a woman, at his own will andpleasure, abandon a son like myself?"
2-53-11,"Alas, Kaikeyi's son Bharata (alone) is happy along with his wife. Like an overlord,he is going to enjoy the prosperous kingdom of Kosala."
2-53-12,"Father is superannuated. I am staying in the forest. Bharata will become the primehead for the entire kingdom."
2-53-13,"He who pursues sensuous pleasures neglecting his real interests and discipline sooncomes to distress; in the same way as king Dasaratha has."
2-53-14,"It seems that Kaikeyi came into our house, oh good brother, to bring about an endto Dasaratha, to send me into exile and to secure kingship for Bharata."
2-53-15,"Blinded by pride of good fortune, Kaikeyi may even now persecute Kausalya andSumitra because of their relationship with me."
2-53-16,"Queen Sumitra is likely to suffer hardship because of her affinity to us. From thisvery place, you proceed to Ayodhya next morning, oh, Lakshmana!"
2-53-17,"I shall proceed to Dandaka forest alone with Sita, while you will be the protectorfor Kausalya, who has no defender."
2-53-18,"Kaikeyi of base deeds may resort to unjustified means to be disliked. Give (forprotection) my mother to Bharata, oh virtuous Prince!"
2-53-19,"In some other (past) birth, women must have been deprived of their sons by mymother (Kausalya), oh, Lakshmana! For that reason this has arisen certainly."
2-53-20,"At a time when Kausalya should have obtained benefits for her labors repaid by me,she has been deprived of my company by me, who was nurtured by her for a long time and brought upwith great pains. Woe to me."
2-53-21,"Let no woman ever give birth to such a son as myself, who have caused perpetualgrief to my mother, oh, Lakshmana!"
2-53-22,"Oh, Lakshmana! I think that myna (which is kept as a pet by mother Kausalya) ismore affectionate than I, since her are heard the words, Bite, oh parrot, the foot of theenemy."""
2-53-23,"What can be done by me, her son, who cannot go to her aid even a little to her, mymother, who is weeping, who is unfortunate and who has no son, oh conqueror of foes?"
2-53-24,"Kausalya my mother of poor luck indeed, bereft of me, is stricken with greatmelancholy and lies plunged in a sea of grief"
2-53-25,"Enraged, I can subdue with my arrows single handed not only Ayodhya but also theearth. But it is not a question of valor here."
2-53-26,"Oh, the sinless Lakshmana! I am terribly concerned of doing wrong and of ruining myprospects in the other world. Hence, I do not allow myself to be crowned."
2-53-27,"Rama during the night in that lonely forest, wailed piteously thus and in so manyother ways and sat quite, his face full of tears."
2-53-28,"Lakshmana consoled Rama as follows when the later had ceased lamenting like a fire whose flames had gone out and as a sea without a violent motion."
2-53-29,"The city of Ayodhya, now that you have come away from it, has certainly beendivested of its splendor and resembles a night without the moon, Oh, Rama the jewel among armedwarriors!"
2-53-30,"It is not proper, oh Rama, that you should grieve in this way. You cause distressto Sita and me too, oh jewel among men!"
2-53-31,"Oh, Rama! Bereft of you , neither Sita nor I will not survive even for a moment,like fish pulled out of water."
2-53-32,"Oh, Rama causing pain to the foes! Without you, I do not wish to see either ourfather or Satrughna or Sumitra or even the heaven."
2-53-33,"Then Rama and Lakshmana the lovers of piety, sitting comfortably there and on seeinga bed well- prepared under a banyan tree, sought for the bed."
2-53-34,"Attentively hearing Lakshmana's words which were excellent and wholistic andadopting for a fairly long period the course of conduct prescribed for hermits, Rama resolved tospend all the fourteen years in exile with Lakshmana."
2-53-35,"Thence forward, those two powerful offspring of the Raghu race (Rama and Lakshmana)never admitted fear or agitation (while dwelling) in that vast and lonely forest any more than acouple of lions on the slopes of a mountain."
2-54-1,"Having spent the beautiful night under the big tree, Rama, Seetha and Lakshmanastarted from that place when the immaculate sun had risen."
2-54-2,"Having penetrated into a deep forest, they the illustrious trios, while seeing manystretches of land and at some places, attractive scenery never seen before, proceeded in thedirection of that region where river Yamuna was flowing forth towards river Ganga, associated withthe name of Emperor Bhagiratha."
2-54-3,"Observing various trees while walking at ease, Rama spoke to Lakshmana (as follows)when the day had just receded."
2-54-4,"Perceive, Oh Lakshmana, the smoke looking prominent as a sign of the glorious godof fire near Prayaga (the confluence of the holy Ganga and Yamuna rivers). I think that sageBharadwaja is staying nearby."
2-54-5,"We have certainly reached the confluence of rivers Ganga and Yamuna. Yes, the noiseproduced by clashing of waters is heard."
2-54-6,"Pieces of timber split up by men who are dependent upon forest-products, as alsothese trees of various kinds are seen in the hermitage of Bharadwaja."
2-54-7,"Having walked comfortably, Rama and Lakshmana wielding their bows, reached the abodeof the sage Bhardwaja, near the confluence of rivers Ganga and Yamuna, while the Sun was falling tothe west."
2-54-8,"Having reached the hermitage and scaring the beasts and birds (by his veryappearance as a bowman) and having proceeded on the intervening path for a while, Rama approachedthe vicinity of Bharadwaja."
2-54-9,"Arriving at the hermitage, the two valiant princes, who wished to see the sage,accompanied by Seetha, halted at first at some distance off."
2-54-10,"Entering the hermitage and beholding the high-souled sage who was austere andcontemplative, his glance sharpened through severe meditation, surrounded by a group of disciples,who had kindled sacrificial fire, the highly fortunate man as he was, Rama together with Lakshmanaand Seetha greeted him with joined palms."
2-54-11,"Rama (the elder brother of Lakshmana) introduced himself to the sage as follows: ""Ohvenerable sage! We both are Rama and Lakshmana the sons of Dasaratha."""
2-54-12,"Here is my blessed and irreproachable wife Seetha, daughter of Janaka who hasaccompanied me to the lonely forest suitable for religious austerities."
2-54-13,"While I was being sent to exile by my father, my young and beloved brotherLakshmana (son of Sumitra) of firm vows has also followed me to the forest."
2-54-14,"Oh, Venerable sage! Commanded by our father, we are entering a lonely forest topractise asceticism, living on roots and fruits."
2-54-15,"Hearing the words of that virtuous prince (Rama), the pious minded sage Bharadwajathen offered Madhuparka* as well as water to wash his hands with."
2-54-16,"The sage, who had practiced austerities, gave them various kinds of delicaciesprepared from wild roots and fruits and also arranged accommodation for them."
2-54-17,"Honouring with words of welcome, the sage Bharadwaja seated, being surrounded on allsides with beasts, birds and hermits, spoke thus to Rama."
2-54-18,"Bharadwaja then said these endowed with righteousness to Rama, who had since takenhis seat after accepting the aforesaid hospitality:"
2-54-19,"In fact, I am seeing you, arriving here after a long time, Oh scion of Kakutstha!And I have heard of your unjust banishment."
2-54-20,"This holy place at the confluence of the two rivers is secluded and delightful. Youstay here comfortably."
2-54-21,"Addressed in these words by Bharadwaja, Rama, born in Raghu dynasty, for his part,interested in the welfare of all, replied in the following pleasant words."
2-54-22,"The people of the city and the rural folks Oh venerable sir, are nearer to thisplace. Finding me easy to see at this place, people keen to see Seetha and myself, I presume, willmake their appearance at this hermitage. For this reason, I do not wish to stay here."
2-54-23,"See some excellent Seetha suitable for a hermitage in some lonely place, Ohvenerable sir, where Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, who is worthy of every comfort, may finddelight in it."
2-54-24,"Hearing these auspicious words of Rama, Bharadwaja the great sage then for his partspoke these suggestive words."
2-54-25,"Sixty miles from here, dear son, lies a sacred mountain on which you may takeupyour dwelling, which region is inhabited by great sages, is charming to look at from all sides,infested by the black species of monkeys with a long tail, haunted by apes and bears, known by thename of Chitrakuta and which closely resembles Gandha maadana mountain."
2-54-26,"As long as a man observes the peaks of Chitrakuta mountain, he will performvirtuous deeds and will never set his mind on a sin."
2-54-27,"On that mountain, many sages having spent hundred years in austerities as though insport , ascended to heaven, duly attaining their final emancipation."
2-54-28,"I consider that mountain to be a very lonely and comfortable place for you to livein. Orelse stay with m here itself, during the period of your exile, Oh Rama!"
2-54-29,"The pious sage Bharadwaja fulfilled all desires of Rama; who was his beloved guestand who was accompanied by his consort, Seetha and his brother, Lakshmana."
2-54-30,"While Rama, having approached that great sage at Prayaga(the confluence of Ganga andYamuna), was discoursing on various topics, the auspicious night arrived."
2-54-31,"Greatly fatigued, Rama(Scion of Kakutstha) accompanied by Seetha as the third(Lakshmana being the second) who was accustmed to all comforts, happily spent that night at thelovely hermitage of Bharadwaja."
2-54-32,"When the night was gleaming into a dawn, Rama the lion among men approached the sageBharadwaja, who was gleaming with resplendence and spoke as follows:"
2-54-33,"We have lodged in your hermitage tonight, Oh venerable sir! (Pray) you give uspermission for fixing our residence now, Oh sage practicing truthfulness !"
2-54-34,"That night having come to an end, Bharadwaja replied for his part, as follows:""Proced to Chitrakuta, rich in honey, tubers and fruits."""
2-54-35,"I consider the abode of Chitrakuta as the right place for you to stay, Oh Rama,possessed of great strength! You set off for that well-known, sacred and lovely mountain,Chitrakuta which is adoned with clusters of trees of every description, frequented by Kinnaras andNagas, is rendered charming by the cried of peacocks and infested with lordly elephants andbountiful with tubers and fruits."
2-54-36,"Since herds of elephants and troops of deer wander all around in the woodlandsthere, you will visibly notice them Oh Rama!"
2-54-37,"Roaming about with Seetha, your mind will be delighted to see rivers, cascades,peaks of mountains, fissures in rocks, caves and rivulets."
2-54-38,"After reaching the auspicious and absolutely beautiful Chitrakuta mountain,reveberant in all direction with the notes of small white cranes and cucukoo birds as well as withmany kinds of deer and elephants in rut, settle down there in a hermitage."
2-55-1,"Having stayed that night there, those princes the annihilators of enemies,thereafter offered salutation to the sage Bharadwaja and proceeded towards that mountain ofChitrakuta."
2-55-2,"That great sage Bharadwaja performed a religious rite ensuring a sage journey(scattering boiled rice on the ground and invoking blessing through the repetition of certainsacred texts0 for them. Perceiving them setting out for the journey, the sage accompanied them fora distance, as a father would do for his sons (and daughter-in-law)."
2-55-3,"Bharadwaja the great sage with a remarkable splendour began to speak the followingwords to Rama the truly brave man."
2-55-4,"After approaching Oh, the best of men! The confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, followthe river Yamuna which takes to the direction of west."
2-55-5,"Reaching the River Yamuna belonging to olden times, having a rapid stream andperceiving in it a passage for descent into the river, which is too much frequented the river,which is too much frequented, you cross the River Yamuna (the daughter of the sun-god) by preparinga raft there, Oh Rama!"
2-55-6,"After crossing the river Yamuna and approaching a large banyan tree named Syama(dark-green) having green leaves surrounded by many tress and visited by Siddhas, Seetha should,joining her palms, recite her auspicious prayers to the tree."""
2-55-7,"Having approached that tree, you can stay there or go beyond it. After going onlyfor two miles from there, you will see a beautiful forest blue in colour with bamboo trees touchingupon Yamuna river and interspersed with Sallaka and jujube trees."
2-55-8,"It is the way to Chitrakuta. I visited that place many times. It is beautiful,endowed with serenity and free from forest-fire."
2-55-9,"Having thus informed the way and ebbing urged by Rama to return after he had paidobeisance to the sage and Rama having replied �so be it', the great sage Bharadwaja returned."
2-55-10,"That sage having returned, Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows: ""Oh Lakshmana! We arefortunate that the sage has shown compassion towards us."""
2-55-11,"Deliberating thus, Rama and Lakshmana the tigers among men who were highlyintelligent, headed for the river Yamuna guarding Seetha still in front."
2-55-12,"Having reached the River Yamuna, running with rapid stream, all of them then plungedinto a thought of how to cross those river-waters."
2-55-13,"Then, Rama and Lakshmana prepared a big raft with pieces of timber fastenedtogether, covered with a kind of grass and spread over with dry bamboo canes."
2-55-14,"Thereafter, the valiant Lakshmana made for Seetha a comfortable seat, after choppingbranches of reeds and of rose apple tree."
2-55-15,"Then Rama the son of Dasaratha helped Seetha his beloved consort who wasunimaginable like the goddess of fortune and who was feeling shy a little- to mount the raft."
2-55-16,"Rama kept the two robes the jewellery, a shovel and a basket by the side of Seethain the raft there, along with weapons."
2-55-17,"Those valiant sons of Dasaratha firmly held that raft, firstly helped Seetha toascend it and then ferried across the river watchfully."
2-55-18,"Having arrived at the middle of Yamuna river, Seetha offered salutation to the riverand prayed as follows: ""Oh, goddess of Yamuna! Adieu! I am crossing you! May my husband completehis vow! When Rama safely comes back again towards the city of Ayodhya, ruled by Ikshvaku kings Ishall propitiate you by offering a thousand cows and a hundred drinking vessels."""
2-55-19,"Seetha of excellent complexion thus praying with joined palms to Yamuna River,forthwith reached the southern side of the river."
2-55-20,"Thus, by the raft, Seetha Rama and lakshmaNa crossed the River Yamuna, which flowsbriskly, wreathed with waves, with many trees born on its bank and having rays for itreflection."
2-55-21,"They, who have crossed the river, abandoned the raft and march through theriver-forest of Yamuna and reached a cool banyan tree called Syama having green leaves."
2-55-22,"Having approached that banyan tree, Seetha spoke these words, ""Oh, great tree!Obeisance to you! Let my husband complete his vow! Let me see again Kausalya and the illustriousSumitra."" Thus speaking, Seetha circumambulated that tree with joined palms."
2-55-23,"Seeing the irreproachable Seetha, who was beloved and obedient to him thus praying,Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows:"
2-55-24,"Oh, Lakshmana, the excellent of men! You take Seetha and proceed in the front. I,along with weapons, will follow you behind."
2-55-25,"Give to Seetha whatever fruit or flower she desires it and wherever this Seetha'smind finds delight."
2-55-26,"Seetha who was walking in the middle of both of them was like an auspicious femaleelephant in the middle of two elephants."
2-55-27,"That Seetha asked Rama whenever she saw the one or the other tree or a bush or acreeper shining with flowers which was not seen earlier."
2-55-28,"Duly grasping Seetha's words; Lakshmana brought to her many kinds of beautiful twigsof trees, full of flowers."
2-55-29,"Then Seetha the daughter of King Janaka was please to see the River Yamuna withwonderful sands and waters re-echoing to the cry of swans and cranes."
2-55-30,"Thereafter having travelled only a couple of miles the two brothers Rama andLakshmana killed many consecrated deer and ate in the river-forest of Yamuna."
2-55-31,"Having strolled in the charming forest, mad noisy by a number of peacocks and whichwas inhabited by elephants and monkeys and reaching an agreeable level ground at the bank of theriver wearing an undejected look finally sought for an abode for the night."
2-56-1,"Then, Rama gently woke up Lakshmana, who was sleeping without break, even when thenight was passing away."
2-56-2,"Oh, Lakshmana! Hear the sound of wild animals, resounding beautifully. It is timefor our journey. Let us start."
2-56-3,"That Lakshmana who was sleeping, being woken up by his brother at the right moment,had relinquished sleep, sloth and strain which resulted on the way."
2-56-4,"Thereafter, all of them raised up touched the auspicious water (took bath) in theriver and proceeded towards the path leading to Chitrakuta mountain, as suggested by the sageBharadwaja."
2-56-5,"Rama who set out along with Lakshmana at that dawn, spoke as follows to Seetha whoseeyes looked like lotus leaves."
2-56-6,"Oh, Seetha! Behold Kimshuka trees with their diadem of flower blossoming all over,as if they are blazing up, in this winter."
2-56-7,"Look at these Bhallataka (cashew nut) trees, abounding in flowers and bent downwith fruits and leaves, all unplucked by men. We can certainly live here."
2-56-8,"Oh, Lakshmana! Behold in every tree the hanging honey-combs, with sizes of awater-trough, gathered by honey-bees."
2-56-9,"In this beautiful forest-region, dense with a scattered mass of flowers, a Chatakabird is crying and a peacock is responding to it."""
2-56-10,"See this Chitrakuta mountain with a high and mighty peak, wide-spread with amultitude of elephants and made to resound by a congregation of birds."
2-56-11,"Oh, brother! We shall sport in this forest of Chitrakuta, having a level-groundbeautifully extensive with many trees and is pure."
2-56-12,"Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha traveling on foot, approached themountain of Chitrakuta, which was pleasant and lovely."
2-56-13,"Reaching that mountain, with various flocks of birds, with many roots and fruits,lovely and rich in streaming water, Rama said to Lakshmana as follows:"
2-56-14,"It is appearing to me that this beautiful Chitrakuta mountain yields an easysustenance, for, it is charmingly filled with various kinds of trees and creepers with differentkinds of roots and fruits."
2-56-15,"Oh, gentle brother! High souled sages are also staying on this mountain. Let thisbecome the dwelling. Let us have a pleasant resort here."
2-56-16,"After deciding thus Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana all with joined palms approached thehermitage and offered salutation to the sage Valmiki."
2-56-17,"The great sage Valmiki, who knew what is right, full of delight, treated them withhonour, offered cordial welcome and requested them to sit."
2-56-18,"Then Rama, the lord with mighty arms, in accord with tradition, reported to theascetic all that concerned them and spoke to Lakshmana as follows:"
2-56-19,"Lakshmana, my gentle brother! Bring strong and choicest timber and construct adwelling. My mind is fascinated in dwelling here."""
2-56-20,"Hearing those words of Rama, Lakshmana brought various kinds of trees. Thereafter,he the annihilator of enemies, constructed a leaf-hut."
2-56-21,"Seeing that hut, which was firmly built and thatched as well as beautiful to lookat, Rama spoke the following words to Lakshmana who listened to his command and who was closelyattentive to him:"
2-56-22,"Oh, Lakshmana! Bring the meat of an antelope. We shall perform a purifactoryceremony while entering the house. Which is to be done by those who wish to live long."
2-56-23,"Oh, large-eyed Lakshmana! Killing the antelope quickly, bring it here. Theprescribed rite according to scriptural point of view indeed is to be performed. Keep in mind thesacred obligation."
2-56-24,"Lakshmana the slayer of enemies, understanding his brother's words, acted asinstructed. Rama spoke again to Lakshmana as follows."
2-56-25,"Oh, gentle brother! Boil this antelope's meat. We shall worship the leaf-hut. Thisday and this instant also are of a distinctive character. Be quick."
2-56-26,"Then, Lakshmana the strong man and son of Sumitra, killing a holy back antelope,tossed it in an ignited fire."
2-56-27,"Feeling certain that it is cooked and heated thoroughly with no blood remaining,Lakshmana spoke to Rama the lion among man as follows:"
2-56-28,"This black antelope, with its complete limbs, has been cooked completely by me. Oh,Rama resembling God! Worship the concerned deity, as you are skilled in that act."
2-56-29,"Rama, the virtuous man and the learned man in chanting of sacred spells, aftertaking bath and with subdued mind, briefly chanted all the sacred scripts to be chanted at the endof a purifactory ceremony."
2-56-30,"Worshipping all classes of deities and getting himself purified, Rama entered thehouse. There was a heartful joy in rama, with his limitless splendour."
2-56-31,"Having taken bath in the river as prescribed Rama offered oblations to Lord Rudraand Lord Vishnu after offereing tributes to Vaisvadeva. He performed benedictions relating to thepurification of house and also a silent prayer as per prescribed rites. He finally offeredexcellent tributes to the deities, for removing sins."
2-56-32,"Lakshmana erected altars in all the quarters of the hermitage as was fitting,Chaityas (places for worship of Lord Ganesha and others) and Ayatanas (places for worship of Vishnuand others)"
2-56-33,"Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha, having auspicious characteristics, satisfiedthe sirits by crowns of flowers obtained in the forest, by fruits roots and cooked meat, by water,by prayers as uttered in the sacred texts (Vedas), by sacred grass, by fuel and Kusa grass and thenentered the auspicious leaf-hut."
2-56-34,"All of them (Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana) together for residential purpose, enteredthat hut, thatched with leaves of trees, looking beautiful, well-constructed at a suitable site andprotected from winds, as if entering an assembly-hall called Sudharma (in heavn) by a group ofcelestials."
2-56-35,"Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana who subdued their senses, very happily strolled in thatexcellent forest, filled with many classes and multitude of beasts and birds, trees havingmulti-coloured crowns of flowers, and resonating with sounds of elephants in rut and ofantelopes."
2-56-36,"Delighted and joyful to reach the lovely Chitrakuta mountain and the riverMalyavati, provided with good descents and frequented by birds and beasts, Seetha, Rama andLakshmana shed the agony caused by their exile from the City of Ayodhya."
2-57-1,"While Rama landed upon the southern shore, Guha conversed for a long time withSumantra and with much distress, went to his house."
2-57-2,"It was gathered by those who were there (Guha and others) about Seetha, Rama andLakshmana coming to sage Bharadwaja, their staying with him in Prayaga and their departure toChitrakuta Mountain."
2-57-3,"Sumantra, being allowed to depart by Rama, tied excellent horses to the chariot andwith intense anguish, rode towards the very city of Ayodhya."
2-57-4,"Sumantra, seeing the sweet-smelling woods, rivers, lakes, villages and towns on theway, soon crossed them."
2-57-5,"Reaching Ayodhya in the evening time of the third day Sumantra saw that city,joyless."
2-57-6,"Beholding Ayodhya as if deserted in silence, Sumantra becoming very much distressedin mind and having afflicted with intense anguish, surmised as follows:"
2-57-7,"I hope the city of Ayodhya with its elephants, horses, people and the kings was notburnt away by a fire of sorrow and blazing grief towards Rama."
2-57-8,"Sumantra, thus lost in thought, reaching the city-gate through the fast-runninghorses, entered the city quickly."
2-57-9,"Meanwhile, seeing Sumantra the charioteer approaching, hundreds and thousands ofpeople ran towards him asking, ""Where is Rama?"""
2-57-10,"He replied them thus: ""Bidding farewell to Rama at the shore of Ganga when sent backby that virtuous and high-souled Rama, I returned here."""
2-57-11,"Hearing that Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana had crossed River Ganga, the people withtheir faces filled with tears sighed, ""Oh, fie upon us! And cried aloud, ""Alas, Rama!"""
2-57-12,"Sumantra also heard the words of those people standing in groups and telling, ""Lostindeed are we, who do not see Rama here!"""
2-57-13,"Never again can we see the pious Rama on the occasions of bestowing gifts,sacrificial performances or marriages or in large meetings."
2-57-14,"The city of Ayodhya was protected by Rama, as by a father, with due regard to whatwas appropriate, what was congenial and what brought happiness to its people."
2-57-15,"While driving through bazaars, Sumantra heard the sounds of lamentation of women,coming forth from windows, consumed by anguish on account of Rama's exile."
2-57-16,"Going through the middle of the royal highway, Sumantra by covering his face,reached the house of Dasaratha."
2-57-17,"Sumantra descended from the chariot, entered quickly the royal palace and traversedthe seven inner apartments of the palace, filled with a large number of people."
2-57-18,"Then, finding the forthcoming Sumantra from their large mansions, from seven-storiedbuildings and from royal palaces, the women who had been emaciated in not being able to see Rama,cried ""Alas! Alas""."
2-57-19,"Those women, extremely confounded with grief with their long and bright eyes filledwith a stream of tears, looked at each other imperceptibly."
2-57-20,"Sumantra also heard the feeble conversation of Dasaratha's wives absorbed in anguishon account of Rama's exile, from their respective inner apartments."
2-57-21,"What Sumantra will reply to the lamenting Kausalya, when he now returns herewithout Rama while he formerly went out with Rama?"
2-57-22,"In spite of her son (Rama) having left Ayodhya, Kausalya continues to survive. Ithink that surely it is difficult thus to live and it is not so easy to preserve it too!"
2-57-23,"Hearing those credible words of Dasaratha's wives, Sumantra all at once entered thehouse, that appeared to be set ablaze with grief."
2-57-24,"Sumantra entered the eighth inner apartment and saw in that white house, KingDasaratha the miserable the sick and the exhausted man on account of the exhausted man on accountof the grief for his son."
2-57-25,"Sumantra approached that king who was seated, offered his salutation and presentedRama's message as told."
2-57-26,"That king heard silently the message of Rama, was bewildered, afflicted by grief,for his son, became fainted and fell on the ground."
2-57-27,"The king thus having fainted, the gynaeceum was hurt. While the king was falling onthe ground, the inmates of gynaeceum wept, raising their hands in distress."
2-57-28,"Kausalya along with Sumitra lifted up their husband, who fell on the ground.Kausalya also spoke these words to Dasaratha."
2-57-29,"Oh, illustrious king! Why are you not speaking to this Rama's messenger who camefrom the forest and who has done difficult things?"
2-57-30,"Oh, Dasaratha! After doing an evil act, you are now feeling shameful. Rise up! Letit be a meritorious act for you. You cannot get a help, when you weep like this."
2-57-31,"Oh, king! On whose fear, you are not enquiring with Sumantra about the welfare ofRama, that Kaikeyi is not here. Speak fearlessly."
2-57-32,"Kausalya, speaking excitedly in tears and entirely given up to anguish uttered thusto the monarch and soon fell to the ground."
2-57-33,"All those women cried in loud voice, seeing Kausalya fallen on the ground weeping asaforesaid and gazing their husband too (lying unconscious)."
2-57-34,"Hearing that crying sound raised in gynaeceum, all aged and young men and women onall sides gathered around weeping. The city then again became disturbed."
2-58-1,"Thereafter, the king when recovered from loss of consciousness and again returned tohis breath, he called that charioteer for the purpose of getting the report on Rama."
2-58-2,"Then, Sumantra, who joined his palms in reverence, approached the monarch who wasrepenting about Rama alone, filled with pain and sorrow, advanced in age, greatly anguished,sighing like a newly caught elephant and reflecting on something as a sick elephant."
2-58-3,"The king, having great distress, spoke to Sumantra, whose body was covered withdust, his face filled with tears, who was miserable and who approached near him (as follows):"
2-58-4,"Oh, Sumantra! Where can Rama the virtuous man abide, taking refuge at the root of atree? What that Rama, who enjoyed very many pleasantries, can eat now?"
2-58-5,"Oh, Sumantra! How can Rama the prince, who was habituated to good beds, sleep withsuch discomfort on a floor like an orphan?"
2-58-6,"Foot soldiers, Chariots and elephants used to follows whenever Rama was marchingahead. How such a man can take shelter and stay in a forest devoid of people?"
2-58-7,"How Seetha Rama and Lakshmana entered forest filled with wild animals and blacksnakes?"
2-58-8,"Oh, Sumantra! How those princes with Seetha the delicate and the poor lady went onfoot, after descending from the chariot?"
2-58-9,"Oh, Sumantra! You have seen my sons entering the forest, as though divinities ofAswini had entered the Mountain-range of Mandara. You are indeed lucky."
2-58-10,"Oh, Sumantra! After reaching the forest, what words did Rama speak? What didLakshmana speak? What did Seetha speak?"
2-58-11,"Oh, charioteer! Tell me where Rama sat, slept and took food. By hearing thesethings, I shall survive, as Yayati survived in the company of saints."
2-58-12,"As asked thus by the king, Sumantra spoke to the emperor in a voice quivering andchoked with tears (as follows)."
2-58-13,"Oh, emperor! Rama, keeping up the prescribed course of conduct, making salutationwith joined palms and bowing his head in reverence to you, spoke to me as follows:"
2-58-14,"Oh, charioteer! Tell my salutations to my father, the one with a remarkableintellect, a mighty soul and the one to be respectfully greeted."
2-58-15,"Oh, charioteer! Enquire about the health of all the people in the gynaeceum withoutany disparity and offer my appropriate salutations to them."
2-58-16,"My mother Kausalya is to be told about my welfare, about my offering salutations toher and about my meticulousness."
2-58-17,"Oh, godly lady! Be always righteous and be interested in offering worship andsacrifices as per the prescribed timings in the House of Fire worship. Nurture the feet of the LordDasaratha, like with a god."
2-58-18,"Oh, mother! Behave towards my other mothers, abandoning self-conceit andindignation. Make the venerable Kaikeyi, agreeable to the king."
2-58-19,"In respect of Bharata your son, follow a respectable behaviour as with a king.Kings are indeed sovereign in substance. Remember the rules relating to kings."
2-58-20,"Bharata is to be enquired about his well-being and he is also to be informed asfollows: Follow good behaviour indeed judiciously towards all your mothers."""
2-58-21,"The mighty armed Bharata the son of Ikshvaku race, is to be told as follows: �Beinginstalled in the office of Prince Regent, attend to your father who still stays in thethrone'."
2-58-22,"The king has crossed his age. But do not depose him on that score. By proceedingaccording to the orders of the king, you live as a prince."
2-58-23,"Shedding tears profusely, Rama again spoke to me as follows : �My mother, who isvery much longing her son, is to be looked after by you as if she is your mother'."
2-58-24,"Oh, emperor! Rama of the most beautiful appearance with red eyes resembling redlotus flowers, while even uttering these words to me profusely shed tears."
2-58-25,"But Lakshmana was very angry and breathing a sigh, spoke to me as follows: �Onwhich offence this prince was expelled from home?'"
2-58-26,"The king even took shelter under a wretched decree of Kaikeyi and performed an actnot to be done, as though it is a proper deed, for which we are now tormented."
2-58-27,"Even if this was done for the good pleasure of the king or through the will of God,I do not see any justification for Rama's abandonment."
2-58-28,"Even if this was done for the good pleasure of the king or through the will of god,I do not see any justification for Rama's abandonment."
2-58-29,"Rama's exile, an illegal decision undertaken whether due to levity of judgment ordue to lack of reflection, will raise countless protests."
2-58-30,"I do not consider the emperor as my father. For me, Rama is the brother, lord,relative and my father."
2-58-31,"Leaving Rama the beloved of all people and who is interested in the welfare of allhuman beings, how would all these people would be interested in you by this act of yours?"
2-58-32,"By banishing Rama who is delightful to entire people and who is a virtuous man andby opposing all this entire world, how will you stay as a king?"
2-58-33,"Oh, King! The wise Seetha for her part with her mind like one possessed andforgetting her own existence, stood sighing and static."
2-58-34,"The illustrious Seetha having not seen such misfortune earlier, could not even tospeak me anything, weeping as she was with that uneasiness."
2-58-35,"Seeing me going back, Seetha with emaciated face, perceiving her husband, soon sheddown tears."
2-58-36,"In the same way, Rama with tears on his face and with joined palms, stood beingshielded by the arms of Lakshmana. The miserable Seetha in the same manner was weeping and seeingthe royal chariot and me."
2-59-1,"Rama having departed to the forest, horses on the return path however, sheddingwarm tears, did not proceed further on the way."
2-59-2,"I, on my part, offering salutation with joined palms to both the princes andkeeping back from that grief, ascended the chariot and moved on."
2-59-3,"With the hope that I shall be called again by Rama, I stayed there along with Guhafor three days."
2-59-4,"Oh, emperor! Even trees in your domain have withered, without giving flowerssprouts and buds, having emaciated due to Rama's separation."
2-59-5,"Rivers, pools and lakes were with hot water. Groves and gardens were with theirleaves, parched up."
2-59-6,"Living beings are not moving. Wild animals too are not roaming around. That forestbecame silent, predominated by grief towards Rama."
2-59-7,"Oh, emperor! Lotus-lakes were with lotus-leaves hiding under water pressingthemselves closely together, with muddy waters, with parched lotus-flowers and in which fish andwater fowls have completely disappeared."
2-59-8,"Water-born flowers and flowers living on dry lands now give very little fragranceand fruits do not have a luscious look as before."
2-59-9,"Oh, best of men! The gardens here are empty of men and the birds have vanished. Iam not seeing the gardens as charming (as before)."
2-59-10,"Nobody greeted me, entering into Ayodhya City. Having not seen Rama, the people arebreathing their sigh of lamentation again and again."
2-59-11,"Oh, emperor! Seeing the royal chariot returning here without Rama, all the peoplealong the royal high-way are shedding tears with grief."
2-59-12,"Seeing the returned chariot, women from mansions, seven-storied buildings and royalpalaces are crying �ha ha!', being troubled by the non-appearance of Rama."
2-59-13,"Women, being more sorrowful, are looking at each other indistinctly with their longbright eyes overwhelmed with a flood of tears."
2-59-14,"I do not see any distinction in their agony, whether they are non-friends, friendsor neutral people."
2-59-15,"Oh, emperor! The city of Ayodhya with its joy-less people, with its elephants andhorses looking miserable, with sighing exhaustion due to cries of pain, filled with sounds ofmoaning, cheerless and feeling anguish due to Rama's exile, appears to me, like Queen Kausalyawithout her son."
2-59-16,"Hearing Sumantra's words, the king in a voice choked with tears and very muchwoeful, spoke to that charioteer as follows:"
2-59-17,"Enjoined by Kaikeyi with her sinful birth and intention, I could not deliberatewith people experienced in counsel or with elders beforehand."
2-59-18,"This act has been done by me in haste due to infatuation for the sake of a woman,without consulting with friends or ministers or with interpreters of sacred texts."
2-59-19,"Oh, Sumantra! This great calamity, surely, has come as an inevitable consequence orfor the ruin of this race or accidentally."
2-59-20,"Oh, sumantra! If at all I have done any favour to you, lead me fast to Rama. Myvital spirits are hastening me."""
2-59-21,"If there is the same unlimited authority of mine even now, let Rama be brought backto Ayodhya. I cannot survive without Rama even for a moment."
2-59-22,"Or perhaps Rama the mighty-armed might have gone a long way. Make me to ascend thechariot and quickly show me to Rama."
2-59-23,"Where is that Rama having pearl-like teeth and wearing a large bow? If only I cansee him well with Seetha, I can survive."
2-59-24,"If I cannot see Rama having red eyes, mighty arms and with ear-rings made of gems,I shall proceed to the world of Death."
2-59-25,"What is more distressing to me after getting into this condition, in not seeinghere, Rama who is a delight to Ikshvaku dynasty?"
2-59-26,"Oh, Rama! Oh, Younger Brother of Rama! Oh, unfortunate Seetha! You do not know thatI am dying with grief, like one abandoned."
2-59-27,"King Dasaratha, his mind very much despaired with grief and plunged in an ocean ofsorrow, very difficult to be crossed, spoke (as follows)"
2-59-28,"Oh, Queen Kausalya! I am plunged in this ocean of grief. Its area of sorrow is forRama. its other shore is Seetha's separation. Its waves and huge whirlpools are sighs of anguish.It is agitated with water and foam as tears. Throwing away of arms is the swarm of fishes. Itsgreat sounds are cries of lamentation. The scattered hari is its duck-week. Kaikeyi is itssubmarine fire. Which is the cause for the rush in my tears. The words of the hum-backed are itshuge crocodiles. Its shores are the boons asked by the cruel Kaikeyi. Its long stretch is due tosending of Rama to far away place. I cannot cross this ocean alive, without Rama. What a pity!"
2-59-29,"Though I want to see Rama and Lakshmana now, I am not able to see them here. It isvery bad. - thus lamenting, the king of great renown soon became unconscious and fell down on hiscouch."
2-59-30,"Hearing his words lamenting as much as twice more pitiably for Rama and the kinghaving fallen unconscious, Kausalya was alarmed once again."
2-60-1,"Then, Kausalya, trembling again and again, as though possessed by a spirit, andlying on the floor without proper disposition of mind, spoke to Sumantra as follows:"
2-60-2,"Wherever Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana are there, take me to them. Without them, I donot cherish to live here even for a moment."
2-60-3,"Turn back the chariot quickly. Take also myself to the forest of Dandaka. Now, if Ido not go after them, I shall enter the Death's abode."
2-60-4,"Sumantra with joined palms and with a voice choked with tears and in faint accents,consoling Kausalya, spoke these words to her."
2-60-5,"Abandon grief, delusion and haste born of affliction. Rama, can reside in theforest, warding off anguish."
2-60-6,"Lakshmana too, knowing about a righteous conduct, having subdued his senses andserving the feet of Rama in the forest, is propitiating the other world."
2-60-7,"Seetha, getting a dwelling place resembling a house even in a lonely forest, hermind encamped in Rama and being fearless, is acquiring confidence."
2-60-8,"Not even very minute depression, even a little, is seen developed in Seetha. Itappears to me as though Seetha is accustomed to so many exiles."
2-60-9,"Seetha is taking delight in the desolate forests in the same manner as she wasearlier enjoying in visiting gardens in the city."
2-60-10,"Seetha, a charming woman with her face resembling a full moon and with her mindabsorbed in Rama, even though staying in a lonely forest, is enjoying it like a little girl."
2-60-11,"Seetha's heart is directed towards Rama. Her life also is dependent on him. Even ifAyodhya is without Rama, then it becomes a forest to her."
2-60-12,"As if only a couple of miles away from Ayodhya and as being in a garden there,Seetha on seeing villages, towns, movement of rivers, and various types of trees, enquires withRama or Lakshmana and Knows well about them."
2-60-13,"I am remembering only these incidents about Seetha. It does not flash to my mindnow of the words hurriedly spoken of by Seetha about Kaikeyi."
2-60-14,"Expunging the remarks spoken by Seetha about Kaikeyi coming almost nearer to hislips by inadvertence, Sumantra spoke only delightful and sweet words to Kausalya."
2-60-15,"Seetha's radiance resembling a moon's gleam is not fading away due to her travel inthe forest or due to the velocity of wind or because of her bewilderment or due to heat of thesun."
2-60-16,"That face of altruistic Seetha resembling a lotus flower, whose lustre is similarto that of a full moon, did not become changed."
2-60-17,"Her feet, which even though no longer painted with vermilion, still looks red asAlakta (red juice obtained from resin of certain trees), with lustre equal to that of red lotusbuds."
2-60-18,"Seetha, sporting her tinkling anklets, walks playfully. Even now, Seetha dons herornaments, as a mark of Her passion towards Rama."
2-60-19,"Seetha who stays in the forest, takes refuge in the arms of Rama and hence does notgive Herself to fear, even by seeing an elephant or a lion or a tiger."
2-60-20,"There is no need to pity them nor us nor the king too. This story will thrive inthe world forever."
2-60-21,"Abandoning grief, possessing cheerful minds, settling well in the path followed bygreat sages, delighting in the forest-life and eating fruits of the forest, they are keeping up thepromise given to their father."
2-60-22,"Even if averted thus by Sumantra, who is speaking appropriately well, beingemaciated by sorrow for her son, could not stop crying, ""O, my dear son Rama!"""
2-61-1,"When Rama, who is excellent in virtue and outstanding among those causing delight,having left for the forest, Kausalya who was feeling pained, spoke, weeping to her husband asfollows:"
2-61-2,"Despite the fame in the three worlds of your great glory that Dasaratha iscompassionate, bountiful and kind in his words, how your two sons along with Seetha who grewcomfortably can bear suffering in the forest when faced with hardships, O the best among theforemost of men!"
2-61-3,"That Seetha, who is a young lady in the prime of her youth and very delicate, canreally tolerate heat and cold?"
2-61-4,"How the large-eyed Seetha can eat a food prepared with wild rice, she having eatenhere a good food containing soups and snacks?"
2-61-5,"How that irreproachable Seetha can hear the horrid sounds of cruel animals andlions, after hearing the auspicious sounds of singing and music here?"
2-61-6,"Where Rama the mighty hero, resplendent as Mahendra's standard and the mighty armedis sleeping indeed with his arm as a pillow?"""
2-61-7,"When can I see the face of Rama with the colour of a lotus, framed with marvelouslocks of lotus-perfume, with eyes resembling lotus-petals and excellent?"
2-61-8,"There is no doubt that my heart is fully made of the solid-interior of a diamond,for which reason this heart is not shattered into a thousand pieces, even in my not seeing of thatRama."""
2-61-9,"It was not a kindly act by you that you banished my kith and kin, who were worthyof comforts to wander around in the forest in such a miserable condition."
2-61-10,"Even if Rama comes back in the fifteenth year, it cannot be inferred that Bharatawill abandon the kingdom and the treasury."
2-61-11,"There are those who in a ceremony in hour of dead relatives, first feed theirrelatives and thereafter, to fulfill their duty, remember to invite the illustrious Twice-born."
2-61-12,"The virtuous and the learned Brahmins, who are like unto gods, do not acceptafterwards even food as delicious as ambrosia."
2-61-13,"The best of Brahmins in their wisdom, will not accept what remains of the food ofwhich other Brahmins have partaken, regarding it as a bull shorn of its horns."
2-61-14,"O, king! Why not the eldest and the best brother refuse to accept the kingdomenjoyed by the younger brother?"
2-61-15,"A tiger does not wish to share a part of food eaten by another animal. In the samemanner, Rama the tiger among men may not accept that which has been enjoyed by another."
2-61-16,"Oblations, clarified butter, leavings of an offering, sacred grass and sacrificialposts made of trunk of Khadira tree, once used, are not put to use again in a sacrifice."
2-61-17,"Thus, Rama cannot accept the kingdom taken away by other, as those not accepting anambrosia whose essence has been taken away or as in a sacrifice, stalks of Soma plant (from which abeverage called Soma is prepared) are lost."
2-61-18,"Rama will not go through such a type of dishonour, as a strong tiger does notendure even touching of its tail."
2-61-19,"Even if all the worlds combine together in a great battle, they cannot stir up fearin him. The virtuous minded Rama will provide righteousness to the people withunrighteousness."
2-61-20,"Rama with great prowess and with his mighty arms can surely burn up all beings andeven the ocean itself by his golden arrows; like at the time of destruction of the world."
2-61-21,"That excellent man with such a lion's strength and with eyes like those of a bullwas ruined indeed by his own father, like killing its child-fish by an adult fish."
2-61-22,"A son, who is devoted to righteousness, has been sent to exile by you. Is it aright thing for you, as seen by scriptures or is it an eternal conduct as practiced by the Twiceborn?"
2-61-23,"O, king! A husband is a chief refuge for a woman. Her second refuge is a son. Thethird refuge is her near-relative. There is no fourth one here."
2-61-24,"Among those three refuges, you do not indeed exist. Rama on his part took refuge ina forest and I do not wish to go there. Thus, I have been ruined in all ways, by you."
2-61-25,"This kingdom along with neighboring states has been ruined by you. You yourselfalong with ministers have been ruined. I along with my son are ruined. Citizens too are ruined.Your son Bharata and your wife Kaikeyi only are delighted."
2-61-26,"Hearing the aforesaid voice of Kausalya, consisting of her cruel words, the kingalso being distressed, became disillusioned. Thereafter, the king then looking back on his own evilact, was entangled in grief"
2-62-1,"When harsh words with anger in this manner by the grief-stricken Kausalya, Rama'smother were heard, king Dasaratha felt depressed and reflected upon them."
2-62-2,"The king fell brooding thus perplexed as he was in his mind and lost hisconsciousness. Thereafter, that king who torments the enemies regained his consciousness after along time."
2-62-3,"After restoring his consciousness he, breathing a long and hot sigh and seeingKausalya by his side, began to worry again."
2-62-4,"As he thus brooded over, he recalled in his mind, a sinful deed that was done by himout of ignorance long ago, by shooting with an arrow an unseen object, the sound of which was onlyheard."
2-62-5,"The mighty emperor felt distressed through agony caused by that sinful dead and asalso through agony caused by separation from Rama and was tormented by the dual grief."
2-62-6,"That king, tormented by the afflictions, was trembling, bent his head down, joinedhis palms in salutation, desirous of getting her grace and spoke to Kausalya as follows:"
2-62-7,"O, Kausalya! I seek your grace. This joining of palms is set out by me. You arealways affectionate even towards others and even indeed kind."
2-62-8,"O, queen! For women reflecting on righteousness, a husband whether he is virtuousor worthless, is a visible god indeed."
2-62-9,"You as such, who is ever intent on virtue, who has understood good and evilfortunes in the world, even if grief-stricken, ought not to have spoken unpleasant words to me, whois too much in distress."
2-62-10,"Hearing those miserable words spoken by the distressed king, Kausalya shed tears,akin to new rain water flowing from channel."
2-62-11,"Capturing on her own head, the king's palms joined in the form of a lotus, Kausalyawas scared and spoke weeping in hurriedly lettered words in eagerness."
2-62-12,"O, king! I appeal to you with my bowed head. I lie prostrate on the floor. I amruined. I am not to be forgiven indeed by you."
2-62-13,"O, Valiant man! In both the worlds, it is ill-becoming of a woman, beingpropitiated by her husband, who is praise worthy and possessing good disposition."
2-62-14,"O, valiant man! In both the worlds, it of a woman, being propitiated by herhusband, who is praise worthy and possessing good disposition."
2-62-15,"Grief ruins courage. Grief ruins sacred learning, grief ruins all. There is noenemy like grief."
2-62-16,"A hitting that descended from the hands of an enemy is possible to be tolerated.But, the grief suddenly descended, even if so small, is not possible to be tolerated."
2-62-17,"O, valiant man! Even ascetics, who know righteousness, who have learnt sacred textsand who have rent asunder doubts relating to religious merit and wealth, go astray having theirminds infatuated with grief."
2-62-18,"Today it is counted as five days since Rama has gone to exile. It is equal to fiveyears for me, since grief has ruined my happiness."
2-62-19,"While I think of Rama, this grief in my heart is increasing, like water in a greatocean increases with the fast streaming of rivers."
2-62-20,"While Kausalya was telling auspicious words indeed as aforesaid the sun becamefeeble and turned towards night too."
2-62-21,"The king, thus cheered up by the queen Kausalya, got subjected to slumber, afterhaving been overcome by grief."
2-63-1,"The king, awakened after some time, with his mind afflicted with grief, got into ananxious thinking."
2-63-2,"Due to banishing of Rama and Lakshmana, a great calamity befell on Dasaratha who wasequal in strength to Indra like sun seized by obscurity, which is attributed to the demon Rahu."
2-63-3,"After Rama along with his wife departed to the forest, Dasaratha the king of Kosalarecalling his earlier sin, wanted to tell Kausalya, whose eye-corners were dark in colour all aboutit."
2-63-4,"After Rama was sent into exile to the forest, King Dasaratha, on the sixth night atmid-night, was recalling his sin done (long ago)."
2-63-5,"King Dasaratha, afflicted by grief for his son, recalling his sin, spoke thefollowing words to Kausalya who was suffering from sorrow for her son."
2-63-6,"O, blessed lady! O gracious one! A doer reaps surely the fruit of his own deedscorresponding to the nature of work either good or bad, of that which he does!"
2-63-7,"He who does not consider, while undertaking actions, the relative value of theirfruits as well as the utilities or defects accruing from them, is surely called a fool."
2-63-8,"Anyone, who after seeing their (charming and big) flowers, greedily desires their(large and luscious) fruits and nourishes Palasa trees, by cutting off a mongo grove, he will cometo grief after bearing of their fruit."
2-63-9,"He who without knowing the result goes running towards action, will come to griefas a nourisher of Kimsuka trees coming to grief at the time of their fruit-bearing."
2-63-10,"I nourished Palasa trees, by cutting off mango grove. Being wicked-minded inabandoning Rama at the time of arrival of fruit, I am lamenting thereafter."
2-63-11,"This sin was done by me while I was young and wielding a bow. At that time, I wasfamous as a young man, who can shoot heard (but unseen) object by an arrow, O Kausalya!"
2-63-12,"This grief, obtained by my own accord, has befallen me, as by a boy in ignoranceeating poison in the world; O, Kausalya!"
2-63-13,"How the other man became disillusioned by Palasa trees, I also became disillusionedin the same manner, without knowing accurately the correct result of hitting a target by means ofsound only."
2-63-14,"O, Kausalya! You were unmarried till then and I was the Prince Regent. Then camethe rainy season which enhanced excitement and desire (for hunting)."
2-63-15,"The sun, partaking fluids from earth and warming the world with its rays, enteredthe terrible southern quarter haunted by spirits."
2-63-16,"Heat disappeared suddenly. Resplendent clouds appeared in the sky. All frogs,cuckoos and peacocks were full of joy."
2-63-17,"Birds with moistened top of their wings as if they bathed, reached with greatdifficulty the trees, the tops of which were shaken off by rain and wind."
2-63-18,"Enveloped by water falling again and again on the water already fallen, themountain with its antelopes in rut, glowed like an ocean."
2-63-19,"Although the water-streams were crystal clear, they flowed in serpentine courses,with white and red colours because of their admixture with ashes and mountain-minerals on theway."
2-63-20,"The water-streams, which were crystal-clear till then, became churned with reddishwaters, carrying water by a wrong way, after the onset of rain."
2-63-21,"With a wish to do hunting as an exercise in that most comfortable season, I wentalong Sarayu River, in a chariot, wearing bow and arrows."
2-63-22,"Without my senses under control and with an intent to kill there a (wild) buffaloor an elephant or any other wild animal coming in the night at that place for the purpose ofdrinking water, I was ready with my bow at a solitary place."
2-63-23,"Hearing the sound, I killed turning towards it, a wild animal, which came to thebank of Sarayu River and another violent beast too which came there."
2-63-24,"Meanwhile, in that darkness and not within the react of the eye, I heard the soundof a pitcher being filled up, the sound of which appeared like that of an elephant."
2-63-25,"With an intent to hit that elephant, I drew out a shining arrow resembling aserpent, targeted towards the direction sound and discharged it."
2-63-26,"I released a sharp arrow, resembling a serpent. There, at dawn, arose a distinctvoice uttering 'Ah! Ah!' of a forest-inhabitant, dropping down in water after his vital part washit by an arrow."
2-63-27,"While that arrow was attacking a human voice there was heard, saying, 'Oh, how aweapon did rush upon an ascetic like me?' "
2-63-28,"'I came to the river, which is away from habitation, in the night to fetch water. Bywhom I was hit by an arrow? On the other hand what wrong have I done to anyone?"""
2-63-29,"To a seer like me, of having laid down violence and living a fruits and roots ofwild plants in the forest, how a killing by an arrow is enjoined?"
2-63-30,"Who is desirous of killing me, wearing a mass of locks of hair and clad with barkof trees and deer-skin? What harm was done to him by me?"
2-63-31,"A vain act concerning only with a useless objective is undertaken in this manner.No one will admire him, as for instance like any man seeking the bed of his preceptor's wife, asgood."
2-63-32,"I do not worry that much of my death. I worry both for my mother and father, in thecase of my death."
2-63-33,"'By what means of livelihood this elderly couple, maintained since a long time byme, support themselves when I obtain my death?'"
2-63-34,"I and my aged parents are killed by a single arrow. By a man without self controland being very much a fool, all of as are virtually killed."
2-63-35,"Hearing those pitiable words and since I was always intent on righteousness, I feltdistressed. The bow and arrow fell down from my hands to the ground."
2-63-36,"Hearing his pathetic cry, weeping profusely during the night, I became unconsciousfrequently, utterly bewildered as I was, due to flare-up of my grief."
2-63-37,"Distressed in mind and with much sorrowful feeling, I reached that place and sawthe ascetic, hit by the arrow at the bank of Sarayu River, with his tresses of hair scattered, hispitcher of water thrown asunder, having his limbs anointed with sand and blood lying down as hewas, hurt by the arrow."
2-63-38,"Looking up with his eyes, as if going to scorch with his glory, at me who stoodterrified and sick in mind, he spoke those harsh words then:"
2-63-39,"O, king! I, who was carrying water for my parents, was hit by you. What was theharm done to you by me who is residing in a forest?"
2-63-40,"'Being hit on my secret part by a single arrow, you virtually killed both my motherand father, who are blind and aged.'"
2-63-41,"Both of them, weak blind and thirsty, might have refrained their thirst withdifficulty and waited with expectation of my arrival since long. I am sure."
2-63-42,"'Surely, our (mine or father's) religious austerity or sacred knowledge have notborne fruit because my father does not have information about me, having fallen down and lying onthe ground.'"
2-63-43,"What my disabled father, unable to walk around can do, even if he knows like a treeunable to protect another tree which is being cut off?"
2-63-44,"'O, Dasaratha! Going there soon, you alone tell my father; so that he will notscorch you by his anger, as a forest is scorched by a flared-up fire.'"
2-63-45,"'O, king! This foot-path will lead you to my father's hermitage. After going there,seek his graciousness, lest he should get angry and execrate you."""
2-63-46,"'O, king! Extract this arrow-head from my body. This sharp arrow torments mydelicate vital part in the same way as a river-current corrodes the sandy bank, which is at aheight.'"
2-63-47,"While extracting the arrow-head from him, this thought entered my mind. Witharrow-head in his body he will suffer, even though surviving. But after extracting the arrow-head,he will die."
2-63-48,"Then, the son of the sage perceived worry in the heart of myself, who was lamentingpitiably, suffering from anguish."
2-63-49,"Sinking into despondency with distress, distorting his limbs in agony, coiling roundhimself on the floor with extreme pain and having approached the end of his life, he spoke to me(as follows) with great difficulty."
2-63-50,"'Suppressing my grief with firmness, I am becoming stable-minded. Let the torment inyour heart, caused by the thought of your having killed Brahmana be removed.'"
2-63-51,"'O, king the ruler of the country! I am not a Brahmana. Let there be no agony inyour mind. I am born through a Sudra woman by a Vysya."
2-63-52,"While he was speaking in that manner with great difficulty, his vital part havingbeen hit by an arrow and was rolling on the ground, now exerting himself, now trembling andsinking, I drew out that arrow from him. That sage looked up towards me in fear and relinquishedhis life."
2-63-53,"O, my dear Kausalya! Seeing him, with his body drenched in water, weeping withanguish, unceasingly sighing his breath, with injury in his vital part and lying down in RiverSarayu as he was, I became very much grief-stricken."
2-64-1,"The high souled Dasaratha, while lamenting about the unworthy killing of that sage,spoke further to Kausalya as follows:"
2-64-2,"Having done that great sin inadvertently, having my senses confounded and I beingalone, I thought of using my reason of what best can be done."""
2-64-3,"Taking the best water fully in that pitcher, I went to that hermitage by the pathas directed by the young sage."
2-64-4,"There I saw the frail, blind and aged parents of the young sage. They were withouta guide to support them, as birds whose wings were cut-off. Without any other occupation, they werenarrating words only about their son. Having no protector and being immobile they lost the hope oftheir son, because of me."
2-64-5,"With my mind afflicted by grief and worried about the impending peril, I fell aprey to further grief after reaching the hermitage."
2-64-6,"Hearing the sound of my foot-steps, that sage spoke as follows: O, son! Why areyou late? Give me the water soon."""
2-64-7,"My dear son! Your mother is regretting why you are playing in water in this manner.Enter the hermitage quickly."
2-64-8,"O, son! My dear! If any disagreeable thing has been done by your mother, or me,you, as a sage ought not have kept it in your mind."
2-64-9,"We being helpless, you are our refuge. We being blind, you are our eyes. Our livesare encircled around you. Why are you not talking with us?"
2-64-10,"As though fearful in mind to behold the ascetic, I spoke to him in a tone which wasindistinct inarticulate and without some consonants?"
2-64-11,"Having strengthened the firmness in my speech and having abandoned fear in my mindby deliberate efforts, I told him of the alarm that awaited him of his son's death."
2-64-12,"I am Dasaratha, belonging to warrior- class. I am not your high-souled son. Thiscalamity created by my own act, despised by noble men, befell upon me."
2-64-13,"O, venerable sage! Wearing a bow in hand, I came to the bank of Sarayu River withan intent to kill an elephant arrived to a ford (for drinking water) or any other wild animal."
2-64-14,"Then by me was heard the sound of a pitcher being filled with water. Guessing it asan elephant, I killed it with an arrow."
2-64-15,"Thereafter, reaching the bank of the river there, I saw an ascetic lying dead onthe ground, with the arrow pierced into his heart."
2-64-16,"O, honorable sage! With a desire to kill an elephant by targeting the sound, Ireleased an iron arrow, and thus your son was killed (hit)"
2-64-17,"Approaching as per his request, closer to him who was suffering from pain, I tookout the arrow soon from his vital part."
2-64-18,"Soon after taking out the arrow, he worried about both of you the parents,lamenting that you were blind and there itself he attained Heaven"
2-64-19,"Unknowingly and unexpectedly your son was killed by me. It has happened like that.Let the honorable sage command me what to do in this matter."
2-64-20,"Hearing that cruel news pronounced by me, confessing my sin, that venerable sagecould not resist his severe anger."""
2-64-21,"That sage with great splendor, whose face was filled with tears and troubled bysorrow, spoke with a sigh to me who came near him with joined palms"
2-64-22,"If you have not told me about this shameful deed yourself, O. king, your head wouldhave burst instantly into a hundred thousand pieces."
2-64-23,"A killing brought about by a warrior premeditatedly and in particular to a hermit,would expel even Indra from his post."
2-64-24,"The head of a dispatcher of a weapon with a knowledge of the matter on a sageestablished in austerity or such an unmarried student practicing sacred study, gets burst intoseven pieces."
2-64-25,"You are still surviving because you have done it unknowingly. Not even you, buttoday the whole of Ikshvaaku dynasty would have been no more, if it is not the case."
2-64-26,"He spoke to me thus: O, king! Now we want to see, as our last look, our son whosebody is drenched in blood, with his garment of deer-skin scattered from him, lying unconscious onthe ground and who is subjected to the dominion of Yama(god of death) . Take both of us to thatplace."""
2-64-27,"Thereafter, taking both of them, who were weeping profusely, to that place, I forone made that sage and his wife to touch their son."
2-64-28,"Approaching their son, that miserable couple touched their son's body and fell onit . Then, his father spoke as follows."
2-64-29,"My dear boy! You are not offering salutation to me, nor do you talk to me. Why areyou sleeping on the floor? Are you angry?"
2-64-30,"O, righteous son! I am beloved to you. Otherwise, see your mother. Why are you notembracing, my son? Utter some words, O delicate youth!"
2-64-31,"Whose sweet and heart touching voice, reciting one sacred text or the other inparticular at the end of the night, shall I hear from now?"
2-64-32,"O, son! Who after taking bath, worshipping the goddess of dawn, and offeringoblations in fire, will be sitting beside me and talking confidently looking at me, as I wasafflicted with grief and fear?"
2-64-33,"Who will feed me, like a beloved guest is fed, with roots and fruits while I amsitting without any work, without fetching anything and without having any guide making me towalk?"
2-64-34,"O, delicate youth! How can I support your mother, who is blind, aged and a poorwoman in a pitiable condition, longing for her son?"""
2-64-35,"O, son! Come to a halt. Do not go to Yama's abode. You can proceed tomorrow with meand with your mother."
2-64-36,"Bereft of you, afflicted with grief, without any protection in the forest and poor,both of us also will come soon along with you to Yama's abode."
2-64-37,"Thereafter, seeing Yama, I shall tell these words to him. �O, Yama! Excuse me. Letthis boy nourish his parents.' "
2-64-38,"The most glorious and high souled Yama, the guardian of the world will be obligedto give this solitary imperishable boon in the form of fearlessness to me, who is in such acondition."
2-64-39,"O, son! This criminal killed you. As it is true that you were sinless, you willsoon obtain the realms as reached by those who die fighting with weapons."
2-64-40,"O, son! Move on to that which is the highest state, which is obtained by thewarriors, who do not return even while being killed, from the direction facing their enemies inbattles."
2-64-41,"Obtain the destiny which was obtained by Sagara, Saibya, Dilipa, Janamejeya,Nahusha and Dundumara."
2-64-42,"O, son! Obtain that destiny, which is obtained by all the sages, by those whostudied scriptures, by an act of austerity, by a gift of the land, by him who has maintained sacredfire, who has taken a vow of marrying a single wife, who gifts a thousand cows, who are owed to theservice of the preceptor and that which is obtained by those who have abandoned their body (byjourneying to Himalayan Mountains, or drowning themselves in water or leaping into the flames)"
2-64-43,"The one born in the race of sages will not obtain an unsafe destiny. The person,who killed you, my son, will obtain that bad destiny."
2-64-44,"Thus, that sage repeatedly wept there pitiably. Then he, along with his wife,started doing the ceremony of offering water to his demised son."
2-64-45,"The pious son of the sage on his part, soon ascended the Heaven, wearing awonderful form along with Indra (the king of celestials) as a result of his own pious acts."
2-64-46,"That son of the sage who was together with Indra, talked to his parents. Consolinghis parents for a while, he spoke the following words."
2-64-47,"I obtained the supreme state because of my service to both of you. You will alsoobtain soon my vicinity."
2-64-48,"The son of the sage, whose senses were subdued, thus spoke and by a wonderful aeroplane with beautiful form, quickly reached Heaven."
2-64-49,"That ascetic with great splendor along with his wife soon performed the ceremonyoffering water to his dead son and spoke to me, who was standing near him with folded hands."
2-64-50,"O, king! You have made me, without a son, by killing my one and the only one son,by an arrow. You kill me also now. I am not frightened about death."
2-64-51,"Since you have killed my holy son through ignorance, I shall pronounce a mostpainful and very cruel curse on you."
2-64-52,"O, king! Even as I am suffering from agony now because of the loss of my son, inthe same manner; you will also die due to agony caused by the loss of your son."
2-64-53,"O, king! Since the sage was killed by you, belonging to the warrior class, throughignorance, the son of killing a Brahmin will not take possession of you."
2-64-54,"A feeling similar to this, which makes the life awful and extinct, will indeedquickly come to you, even as a merit accrues to the donor of a donation to the priest."
2-64-55,"Pronouncing the curse thus on me, that couple wept many times pitiably, placedtheir body on the funeral pile and proceeded to heaven."
2-64-56,"O, Kausalya! The sin I myself committed through ignorance on that day, by invokingan arrow and hitting an invisible object the sound of which was heard, I remember it now onreflection over it."
2-64-57,"O, Kausalya! As a disease comes sometime after eating a nutriment mixed withforbidden things, this present occurrence came as a result of the sinful act by me long ago."
2-64-58,"O, my dear lady! Those words of that noble sage, saying that I shall give up mylife due to grief for the loss of my son, have come true to me now."
2-64-59,"O, Kausalya! I am not able to see you with my eyes. Touch me well Thus speaking,King Dasaratha, terribly weeping said to his wife as follows:"
2-64-60,"O, queen! The wrong that was done by me in respect of Rama was not befitting of me.But the good that was done by Rama in my case was worthy only of him."
2-64-61,"Which wise man on this earth can abandon his son, even if he is of a bad conduct?Which son, even if he is sent to an exile, cannot become angry with his father?"
2-64-62,"Can Rama now touch me or approach me forth with? Men who attained the world of Yama(god of death) cannot even see their kith and kin."
2-64-63,"O, Kausalya! I am not able to see you with my eyes. My memory- power is fadingaway. Messengers of Yama (god of death) are hastening me to come."
2-64-64,"What can be more sorrowful than the fact I am not able to see Rama, who knowsrighteousness and who is a truly brave man, at the time of my death?"
2-64-65,"The grief arising out of non-appearance of that son, who performs unparalleledactions, is parching up my life, as sun- shine dries up a water drop"
2-64-66,"They are not humans but celestials, who will be able to see again in the fifteenthyear, the beautiful face of Rama, wearing his handsome ear-rings."
2-64-67,"The fortunate can see the face of Rama, looking like a moon, with its eyesresembling lotus leaves, with beautiful eye brows, with a comely row of teeth and a charmingnose."
2-64-68,"Fortunate are they, who can see the sweat smelling face of Rama, resembling theautumnal moon and also a full- blown lotus."
2-64-69,"Happy ones can see Rama, who having finished his exile, will come to Ayodhya likethe planet Venus coming from a journey."
2-64-70,"O, Kausalya! My heart is sinking down by delusion of mind. I am not able to graspthe related sound, touch and the smell."
2-64-71,"All of my senses are getting scared away due to mental break down, as rays of lightof a lamp whose oil is exhausted, starts splattering."
2-64-72,"This grief caused by my own self is collapsing me, who am helpless and insensible,like a river bank being collapsed by the floods of a river stream."
2-64-73,"O, mighty armed! O, Rama! O, annihilator of my grief! Alas! O, darling of yourfather! O, my protector! O, my son! Where have you gone?"
2-64-74,"O, Kausalya! O, Sumitra, the miserable! Alas! O, Kaikeyi, the cruel one! My enemy!The disgrace of my family! I am going to die."
2-64-75,"In this manner, King Dasaratha weeping as aforesaid, reached the end of his life inthe presence of Kausalya and Sumitra."
2-64-76,"King Dasaratha of noble appearance, thus speaking, who was already miserable anddistressed for sending his son to exile, felt afflicted with extreme grief by the time the mid-night passed and forthwith abandoned his life."
2-65-1,"While the night passed away, there arrived at the residence of the emperor, at thedawn of the next day, highly cultured and excellently learned bards who were pronouncers ofbenedictions and whose custom was to eulogize the king, as well as singers and panegyrists utteringrecitations in different styles."
2-65-2,"Their sounds of praises, uttering benedictions in a loud voice and pronouncingaccolades of the king, pervaded in full the interior area of the palace."
2-65-3,"While those bards are uttering praises, others who make a bang of claps, patted theclaps, eulogizing the previous glorious acts of Dasaratha."
2-65-4,"The birds dwelling in royal palaces perched on the branches of trees and others incages were awakened by that sound and began to twitter."
2-65-5,"The auspicious words uttered by bards parrots etc and the notes of Vina as well asblissful songs of the metric verses filled that palace."
2-65-6,"Then, as before, persons who maintain pure practices and those who were skilled inthe services to the king, most of whom were women and eunuchs, arrived there to serve the king."
2-65-7,"Those who took care of royal ablutions brought water sprinkled with yellow sandal ingolden pitchers in accordance with appropriate time and the set procedures."
2-65-8,"In that manner, women too most of whom were virgins brought all that were pleasingto the touch, eatables, decorative clothing and ornaments."
2-65-9,"All that was brought near him was endowed with all auspicious characteristicsoffered with reverence as per prescribed scriptures. All that was extremely graceful."
2-65-10,"All that retinue, greatly excited as they were, without coming near to the king andwith a suspicion as to what was it, stayed thus till sunrise."
2-65-11,"The women who were empowered to go near the bed of Dasaratha went in proximity tohim and woke him up."
2-65-12,"Even so, those modest and prudent women with proper conduct, touched Dasaratha's bedand could not detect any sign of life whatsoever in him."
2-65-13,"Those women knew the condition of a body in sleep, by its gestures, movements andothers. As such, they were possessed of tremor apprehensive as they were about the king's life andthey resembled like tips of reeds standing against a stream."
2-65-14,"Now, seeing the king, certainty arose in the minds of those doubting women about thecalamity (of death) that was apprehended."
2-65-15,"Overpowered by grief for their sons, the slumbering Kausalya and Sumitra did notwake up, as though they were completely overtaken by death."
2-65-16,"Kausalya bereft of luster, pale faced, emaciated with grief and dispirited, did notshine brightly (as before) like a star hidden away in darkness."
2-65-17,"The queen Kausalya, immediately close to the king and with Sumitra on her side, wasnot shining as before with her face ruffled by tears of grief."
2-65-18,"The persons in the gynaecium, having seen those distinguished queens in slumber andalso the king in that manner, thought that the king had lost his life while just sleeping."
2-65-19,"Then, those beautiful women miserably cried loudly with their voice, like femaleelephants crying when their group leader an elephant was removed from their place in theforest."
2-65-20,"Kausalya and Sumitra suddenly obtained consciousness by the sound of their cries andwoke up from sleep."
2-65-21,"Kausalya and Sumitra, on seeing and touching king Dasaratha, cried �O, Lord!' andfell on the ground."
2-65-22,"Rolling on the floor and covered by dust, Kausalya the daughter of Kosala king wasnot shining as before and resembled a star falling down from the sky."
2-65-23,"While the king was deceased, all the women saw Kausalya who fell on the floorappearing as a female elephant, which was killed and felled on the ground."
2-65-24,"Kaikeyi and all other wives of king Dasaratha were weeping afflicted by grief andfell unconscious."
2-65-25,"That great noise was supplemented by those wailing women, bloated by which, itrendered the house all the more noisy."
2-65-26,"That gynaecium of the king who met his appointed end was filled with people who feltbewildered with fear and restlessness, with tumultuous wail all around, and crowded with relativesdisturbed by sorrow, with happiness withered away in it suddenly and became a sight of misery anddespondency."
2-65-27,"Knowing that the glorious king of excellence had passed away, the king's wivessurrounded him with great sorrow; pitiably wailing profusely and lamented, grasping their hands oneanother, like orphans."
2-66-1,"Seeing the aforesaid deceased king, who looked like a fully extinguished fire, awaterless ocean and a lusterless sun, Kausalya holding the king's head on her lap with her eyesfull of tears and who was stricken with grief of various sorts, spoke to Kausalya as follows:"
2-66-2,"O Kaikeyi the cruel one and the doer of evils! You be there, having fulfilled yourdesires. Deserting the king, you can enjoy the kingdom undisturbed and without any hindrance."
2-66-3,"Rama has left me and gone to the forest. My husband too has left for heaven. I donot wish to live, as one left behind by a caravan in a wrong road."
2-66-4,"Which woman would wish to survive, leaving her husband who was divine, exceptKaikeyi who kicked off righteousness?"
2-66-5,"A greedy person cannot understand one's faults, like one who eats a forbidden dish.Due to that hump- backed woman, Kaikeyi has ruined the race of Raghu dynasty."
2-66-6,"Hearing Rama along with his wife have been sent to exile by the king as he wascoerced as he was (Kaikeyi) to do an unworthy act, Janaka will profusely lament as I do."
2-66-7,"Rama the pious man who is possessed of like lotus leaves, and who has disappearedfrom here even though living, now does not know me to have because a support -less widow."

2-72-13,"O, mother! I will grasp in obeisance my father's feet. Tell about him, as I askyou. Or is he in the house of Kausalya the senior most of my mothers?"
2-72-14,"Deluded by the greed for kingdom, Kaikeyi who knew everything closely, told theterribly unpleasant news to Bharata, who did not know anything, as though the news wasdelightful."
2-72-15,"King Dasaratha, your father who was having a noble nature, who was respect andperforming frequent sacrifices as well as a refuge to good men followed that path which all beingsfollow."
2-72-16,"Bharata, a righteous man with a noble descent and an honest man, hearing that news ,immediately fell down on the ground, being exceedingly tormented by the grief for his father."
2-72-17,"The mighty armed and heroic Bharata, raising his grievous and depressed voice,cried, ""Alas, I am undone' and lifting up his arms, fell down."
2-72-18,"Then, Bharata of great majesty, who was enveloped in grief and whose mind wastroubled by reeling under the death of his father, lamented profusely."
2-72-19,"These beautiful couch of my father earlier used to enhance its charm with hissplendor, as the moon irradiates the stainless sky in the night at the end of a rainy season."
2-72-20,"Being unoccupied by my virtuous father, the same couch now is bereft of its glory,like the sky without the moon or like the sea with its water dried up."
2-72-21,"Covering his lovely face with a raiment, Bharata the first of those who arevictorious, with a proffond distress in his mind shed tears in lamentation."
2-72-22,"Kaikeyi lifted up from the floor, her son Bharata, who was pained with sorrow,looking like a god, who fell on the ground like a sala tree, cut off by an axe, appearing like anelephant in rut, looking like the moon and sun,afflicted with grief as he was and spoke thefollowing words:"
2-72-23,"O, the highly illustrious prince! Arise,arise! Why are you lying down? Gentlemen,like you, respected in the assembly of men, do not grieve indeed."
2-72-24,"O, Bharata endowed with understanding! Your intellect, which follows good characteras well as sacred scriptures, has an authority to donate and sacrifice, ever shining as such like asplendor in the abode of the sun."
2-72-25,"Encircled by numerous afflictions, Bharata weeping for a long time , rolled over thefloor and replied to his mother as follows:"
2-72-26,"Making up my mind that the king was either going to anoint Rama as a prince regentor to perform a sacrifice, I cheerfully got into the journey."
2-72-27,"All this turned to be otherwise. By not beholding my father, who was foreverinterested in my wishes and welfare, my heart is broken to pieces"
2-72-28,"O, mother! On what ailment did the king die, when I was not here? Rama and otherswho performed purificatory rites by themselves for our father indeed fortunate."
2-72-29,"It is sure that the illustrious monarch does not know the fact of my arrival.Otherwise, my father quickly would have indeed smelled my head, by bending me in affection."
2-72-30,"Where is the caressing hand of my dear father of unwearied action wipe away thedust with which I am covered?"
2-72-31,"Announce soon about my arrival to Rama of immortal exploits, he who is a wisebrother to me, my father, my friend and to whom Iam a servant."
2-72-32,"An elder brother indeed becomes a father for a faithful man who knowsrighteousness. I will grasp his feet in obeisance. He is indeed the refuge for me now."
2-72-33,"What did my father the king, who know virtue , who was forever pious, who was trueto his promise, who was strictly truthful, who was truly valiant and who was honorable, say?"
2-72-34,"I want to hear exactly the last message of my father to me. Thus requested byBharata, Kaikeyi spoke the following words in accordance with truth."
2-72-35,"That high soled king, who was excellent in understanding the Universal spirit,departed to the world, crying �O, Rama, O, Sita, O, Lakshmana!'"
2-72-36,"Your father spoke the following last words also, when he was abandoned by theoperation of time , like a huge elephant surrendered into a trap."
2-72-37,"Those men who are able to see Rama returning Sita and the mighty armed Lakshmanaare those who are fortunate enough"
2-72-38,"Hearing the aforesaid pronouncement, which disclosed second unpleasant news, Bharatawas dejected. Becoming gloomy faced, he once again asked his mother as follows:"
2-72-39,"Where did the virtuous Rama, who augments Kausalya' s delight go now along with mybrother Lakshmana and with Sita?"
2-72-40,"Asked by Bharata in this manner, his mother started telling so greatly unpleasantwords, exactly as it had happened, as though they were very pleasant words."
2-72-41,"O, son! He, that prince Rama, wearing long narrow pieces of bark, went indeed tothe great forest of Dandaka, followed by Lakshmana and also sita."
2-72-42,"Hearing these words, Bharata being aware of the glory of his race, doubted andfearedwhether Rama was sent to exile because of his unrighteous conduct, if any and again asked hismother as follows:"
2-72-43,"Has not Rama indeed stolen the wealth of some Brahmana? Has not he done any harmeither to a rich or to a poor virtuous man?"
2-72-44,"Has the prince indeed not longed for the wife of another? Why was my brother Ramaexpelled to the forest of Dandaka?"
2-72-45,"Thereafter his mother, an unsteady woman, on account of her feminine nature began tonarrate her act which was the exact state of the case."
2-72-46,"Kaikeyi, a fool thing herself to be learned, after hearing the queries of thevirtuous Bharata, delightfully spoke the following words:"
2-72-47,"Not even a little of belonging to a Brahman was stolen by Rama,No harm was done byhim either to a rich or to a poor virtuous man. Rama does not even look with his eyes, the wives ofothers."
2-72-48,"O, son! Immediately on hearing decidedly about the coronation ceremony of Rama byme then, I asked your father to bestow kingdom to you and for banishment of Rama to the forest"
2-72-49,"Submitting to his own decree, King Dasaratha, your father has done all that wasrequested by me. Rama along with Lakshmana and Sita too were sent into exile."
2-72-50,"That beloved son having not been seen, the very celebrated monarch was mademiserable by the grief for his son and obtained death"
2-72-51,"O, Bharata knowing righteousness! The king- ship may be taken charge by you now.All this was indeed done for your sake in this manner by me."
2-72-52,"O, son! Do not dwell in grief and anguish. Dwell in courage. This city along withthe salubrious kingdom indeed is subservient to you."
2-72-53,"Hence, meet the chiefs of Brahmanas like Vasishta and others who know the rituals,perform soon the sacred rites to the king and become crowned as a king yourself to the earth, beingnot depressed in spirit."
2-73-1,"Hearing that his father was dead and both his brothers were exiled; Bharata wastormented with grief and spoke the following words:"
2-73-2,"Bereft of my father as well as my brother too, who is exactly like my father, whatis the use of a kingdom now to me, lamenting as I am with despair?"""
2-73-3,"Making Dasaratha to die and turning Rama to be an ascetic, you brought one calamityafter another like sprinkling salt on a wound."
2-73-4,"You came for destruction of our race, like the night of destruction coming at theend of the world. My father could not be aware of his embracing a live char-coal to his bosom."
2-73-5,"O, the malevolent woman! You caused the death of my father. O, the one who made ourrace unchaste! In this race, happiness is deserted through your ignorance."
2-73-6,"My father, king Dasaratha, who was true to his promise and immensely famous, nowdied, tormented as he was with bitter grief, because of you."
2-73-7,"Why did you kill my father the monarch, who was intent on righteousness? Why didyou send Rama on exile to the forest?"
2-73-8,"It is impossible that Kausalya and Sumitra, who are afflicted with grief for theirsons, will live in fellowship with you, my mother."
2-73-9,"Even Rama my elder brother, a pious man who knows how to behave with elders, usedto act with the best behavior in your case, exactly as how he was behaving with his ownmother."
2-73-10,"In the same manner, Kausalya, my elder mother having far sightedness andestablished in piety, indeed used to behave with you as your sister."
2-73-11,"Why are you not lamenting, after sending Rama, the disciplined Kausalya 's son,clothed in a bark dress, to live in a forest? O, sinful one!"
2-73-12,"You indeed sent into exile, clad in a bark dress, Rama having a virtuousdisposition, a valiant man, a self controlled and illustrious man as he was. What reason do yougather for it?"
2-73-13,"I think it is not known to you, a greedy woman, about my devotion towards Rama. Itis exactly so. You have brought in this great calamity for the sake of a kingdom."
2-73-14,"By which source of strength can I be able to protect the kingdom, without thoselions among men, Rama and Lakshmana in proximity to me?"
2-73-15,"Dasaratha the monarch, having great strength and a pious mind always indeed used totake refuge in that strong man Rama as the Meru mountain takes refuge in a forest surrounding themountain."
2-73-16,"By what stamina, shall I sustain this burden of kingship any more than a youngbullock that is yet to be tamed, would stand the strain on getting a load, lifted up with ease by agiant bullock."
2-73-17,"Or even if a strength can be brought into existence in me by following certainsuitable methods or by strength of intelligence, I will not allow you, who are greedy in fetchingof kingdom for your son, to fulfill your desire."
2-73-18,"No aversion would be felt by me even to desert you, a woman of evil designs, ifRama did not treat you like a mother at all times."
2-73-19,"O, malevolent woman with your good conduct disappeared! How this idea forbidden byour ancestors, has arisen in your mind at all?"
2-73-20,"The eldest of all in this race should be indeed anointed as a king. The rest of hisbrothers are to behave reverently towards their elder brother."
2-73-21,"O, cruel woman! I feel that you are not catching even a glimpse of the rulesrelating to kings or not even aware of a permanent procedure prevailing in the administration ofkings."
2-73-22,"According to the administration of kings the eldest son always indeed getsinaugurated in kingdom. This procedure is similar to all kings; especially so in the case ofIkshvaku kings."
2-73-23,"The pride of reputation of those belonging to Ikshvaku race, who protectrighteousness alone and who possessed good family conduct, is turned away by you today."
2-73-24,"Even kings belonging to your ancestral race were great people. How has thiscontemptible stupidity of mind born in you?"
2-73-25,"O, woman with evil designs! I for one will not fulfill your desire. A criminal act,which will cause even an end to my life, has been undertaken by you."
2-73-26,"Now itself at the cause of your dislike, I for one will bring back from the forest,my brother, who is a faultless man and a beloved man of his people."
2-73-27,"Bringing back Rama with a very firm mind, I will become a servant to him, who isradiant with glory."
2-73-28,"Speaking as aforesaid, the high soled Bharata, pricking her with a multitude ofunpleasant words, roared again like a lion stationed in a mountain cave."
2-74-1,"Reproaching Kaikeyi in that manner, Bharata again spoke the following words, wrappedas he was in great anger."
2-74-2,"O, Kaikeyi! The cruel and evil-mannered woman! Get lost from this kingdom. Youhaving abandoned righteousness, remain lamenting about me, who will be dead soon."
2-74-3,"What harm king Dasaratha or the highly righteous Rama have done to you so harshlythat Dasaratha's death and Rama's exile have occurred at one and the same time because of you?"
2-74-4,"O, Kaikeyi! You got the sin of killing an embryo because of the destruction of thisrace. O, Kaikeyi! Go to hell .Do not get the residence in the same heaven as your husband."
2-74-5,"You have done this terrific act and committed such a great sin. By forsaking thepersons beloved by all, an alarm has been created in me also."
2-74-6,"My father died and Rama is dwelling in a forest, because of you. You got me illfame in this world of beings."
2-74-7,"Though in appearance you are my mother, you are inimical to me. You are a cruelwoman, greedy of kingdom. With evil conduct, you killed your husband. I should never speak toyou."
2-74-8,"Kausalya, Sumitra and my other mothers are engrossed in a great misfortune, byfalling victim to you, who brought disgrace to our family."
2-74-9,"The righteous Rama, who is forever devoted to truth, was sent to the forest. Due togrief for his son, my father went to heaven. You do not seem to be the daughter of Asvapati, thepious and sensible king. You were born there as a demo ness, to destroy the house of myfather."
2-74-10,"The aforesaid sin you have committed has made me father less. Besides, I have beenabandoned by my brothers and all the people dislike me now."
2-74-11,"O, woman having evil desires, moving towards hell! Which world will you attain now,after making Kausalya endowed with righteousness, deprived of her son?"
2-74-12,"O, cruel woman! Don't you know that Rama the son of Kausalya is a subdued man, whois devoted to his relatives and as an eldest brother, equal to a father?"
2-74-13,"A son is the most beloved to his mother as he is born from the primary andsecondary limbs of her body and also from her heart. The other relatives are only likefriends."
2-74-14,"Once upon a time, Kamadhenu the mythical cow of Vasista, who knew righteousness andwas worshipped by celestials, is said to have seen her sons, drawing a heavy burden on earth andbecame unconscious."
2-74-15,"Seeing her sons (a pair of bullocks) fatigued, after toiling for half a part oftheir day on earth, Kamadhenu the mythical cow cried with her eyes full of tears in grief for thefate of her sons."
2-74-16,"Small and sweet smelling tear drops of that mythical cow fell on the limbs of thehigh soled Indra the lord of celestials, who was traveling below in a lower region."
2-74-17,"Seeing those sweet- scented tears falling on his limbs, Indra the Lord ofcelestials identified the tears to be those of the great Kamadhenu the mythical cow."
2-74-18,"Looking into the sky, Indra saw that Kamadhenu standing there with anguish andpitiably weeping with great grief."
2-74-19,"Indra the lord of celestials with a thunder bolt in his hand, seeing that beautifulKamadhenu the mythical cow, tormented with grief, spoke eagerly with joined palms to her, asfollows:"
2-74-20,"O, cow the well wisher of all! I hope there is no great panic from any quarter tous. For what occasion is your sorrow?"
2-74-21,"Hearing the words of the intelligent Indra the god of celestials, the prudentKamadhenu who was skilled in expressing words, replied as follows:"
2-74-22,"Heaven forefend that evil! O, Indra the lord of celestials! There is no dangerwhatsoever to you from any quarter. Seeing these pair of bullocks, my sons, who are in hardship,being scorched by sun's rays, becoming weak, being troubled by the man who ploughs the land andbeing immersed in grief, I am pitiably weeping O, Indra!"
2-74-23,"By seeing them who are afflicted with the burden and aggrieved, I am greatlyanguished. They are indeed born of my body. There is no dearest one equal to a son indeed!"
2-74-24,"Seeing such a sacred cow weeping, whose hundreds of sons pervaded the entire world,Indra reckoned none whosoever as more than a son (to a mother) ."
2-74-25,"Such a Kamadhenu the sacred cow, which is desirous of maintaining the world alwayshaving unequalled behavior, the venerable one, by its very nature functioning forever with goodqualities and to whom there are thousands of sons, is lamenting, how much more indeed Kausalya willdrag her existence, without Rama?"
2-74-26,"She, who has only one son and who is a holy woman, has been made without a child byyou. Thereafter, you will obtain grief forever after your death or even here while living."
2-74-27,"I for my part, shall toil for the complete reinstatement of my brother and completethe obsequial rites due to my father as well as for their prosperity and glory. There is nodoubt."
2-74-28,"Rama the son of Kausalya, of great prowess will be brought back to Ayodhya and I,myself will go to the forest inhabited by the sages."
2-74-29,"O, wretched and evil minded woman! By seeing the sorrow stricken citizens, I amindeed not able to bear the inequity done by you."
2-74-30,"As for you, enter the fire or you yourself go to forest of Dandaka.or fasten a ropearound your neck. There is no other recourse for you."
2-74-31,"After Rama the truly mighty man, obtains his native land, I will even become anaccomplished man, with my sins duly washed away."
2-74-32,"As an elephant in a forest pricked with a javelin and a goad and as a hissingserpent, Bharata was enraged and fell on the ground."
2-74-33,"His eyes inflamed, his clothes in disarray, and his all ornaments discarded, Bharatathe prince and the tormentor of foes, lay on the earth, like a banner of Indra raised at the end ofa ceremony**"
2-75-1,"That valiant Bharata, having come to himself a long time on obtaining consciousness,saw his mother whose eyes were filled pitiably with tears, reproached her mother in the midst ofthe ministers and said as follows:-"
2-75-2,"I never desired for the kingdom nor consulted about this matter with even mymother. I was not aware of the proposed coronation, which has of the been contemplated by kingDasaratha; since I was staying indeed in a distant land, along with Satrughna."
2-75-3,"I was neither aware of the banishment of Rama to the forest nor about how the exileof Lakshmana and Seetha have occurred."
2-75-4,"Recognising the voice of Bharata the noble man, crying out in that manner, Kausalyaspoke the following words to Sumitra:"
2-75-5,"Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, the doer terrific deeds arrived. I went to see thatfar-sighted Bharata."
2-75-6,"That kausalya who became pale with her demeanor, dirty and emaciated, speaking toSumitra as aforesaid, became agitated and absent minded and proceeded to Bharata's place."
2-75-7,"Bharata, the younger brother of Rama on his part, along with Shatrughna started outto Kausalya's place."
2-75-8,"Seeing Kausalya who was afflicted with grief, who fell unconscious (on the way) whowas crying and who was an honorable woman with a noble mind. Shatrughna and Bharata wept in sorrow,approached her painfully and embraced her."
2-75-9,"Kausalya who was very much in sorrow , spoke the following words to Bharata: ""you,who have a desire for kingdom, have got this invincible kingdom .""Alas! By the cruel deed ofKaikeyi, it was obtained by you soon!"""
2-75-10,"The ruthless Kaikeyi condemned my son to wear garments of bark and sent him todwell in the forest: What merit has she gained from this?"
2-75-11,"Kaikeyi ought to send me too without delay to the place where my illustrious sonwith a golden novel (the distinguished mark of Vishnu the god of creation) is there."
2-75-12,"Otherwise, I for my own satisfaction accompanied by Sumitra, placing infront(carried by Brahmana) the sacred fire*** will happily set out to the place Raghava hasgone."
2-75-13,"Otherwise, you yourself ought to conduct me now, if you so desire, to the placewhere my son, the tiger among men, is living as an ascetic."
2-75-14,"This vast kingdom, endowed with elephants, horses and chariots and stock piled withgrains and riches, has been made over to you by her."
2-75-15,"Derided with these and other harsh words that he had not merited, Bharata wasextremely perturbed, as if a needle was thrust into an open wound."
2-75-16,"His mind being perplexed and having lost his consciousness, Bharata then coming hissenses, wailed in many ways and fell at the feet of the queen."
2-75-17,"Then, Bharata with folded hands, replied as follows to Kausalya who was encircled byafflictions and weeping as aforesaid in many ways:"
2-75-18,"O, noble woman! Why do you reproach me, sinless as I am, for those things that I donot know anything? Nay, you know well of the greatest affection I have for Rama."
2-75-19,"May the mind of the one who in any way whatsoever allowed for the departure of myelder brother the best of men who keeps up his promise, be closed to all the seriptures."
2-75-20,"May he who counseled the banishment of my noble brother become the slave of thevilest scoundrels, may he answer the calls of nature in the face of the sun and may he kick withhis foot, a sleeping cow."
2-75-21,"With whose counsel my elder brother went to exile, to him let that sin incur, as toa master who imposes the heaviest labour on his servant without remunerating him."

2-76-8,"O, king! Bereft of you and deprived of its lord, this earth does not look charming.To me, this city is looking like a night without a moon."
2-76-9,"The great sage Vasishta again spoke the following words to that Bharata who wasdistressed in mind and thus lamenting."
2-76-10,"O, mighty armed Bharata! Without hesitation or repining, carry out the funeralrites of the king that should be done."
2-76-11,"Be it so answered Bharata and obedient to Vasishta's command, he summoned speedilythe appointed priests who were knowing the rules of the funeral rites."""
2-76-12,"The fires of that king were prepared outside the chamber and kindled in accordancewith the rituals by the priests and the sacrificial attendants."
2-76-13,"The attendants were choked with tears in their throats and disconsolate in theirmind, made the dead king to mount on a small palanquin and carried it away."
2-76-14,"The people went along the path, scattering silver, gold and various kinds of clothesin front of the king."
2-76-15,"In the same manner, some others brought sandal wood, sweet aloes, different fragrantessences, with leaps of Sarala Padmaka and Devadaru woods and many other kinds of fragrantsubstances, went there and threw them into the funeral pile. Thereafter the appointed priestscaused the king's body to lie down there in the midst of the funeral pyre."
2-76-16,"Then, those priests engaged for the benefit of the king poured oblations into thefire and recited sacred texts (relevant to the funeral rites). Those among the priests, who couldrecite the hymns of Samaveda, chanted them according to the rules."
2-76-17,"Then, his ladies, encircled by elders mounted palanquins or other vehicles, asdeserving and departed from the city to that place."
2-76-18,"Then, the appointed priests as well as Kausalya and other women who were tormentedwith grief, circumambulated in anti clockwise direction that king who was lying on a funeralpile."
2-76-19,"At that time the crying sounds of thousands of women, pitiably weeping with agony,were heard like the sounds of female curlew birds."
2-76-20,"Thereafter, the lamenting ladies deprived of their grit wept again and again anddescended from their vehicles at the bank of Sarayu River."
2-76-21,"Along with Bharata, the royal women, the ministers and family priests offered theiroblations with water and entered the city with their eyes filled in tears and spent ten days withgreat difficulty by sleeping on bare floor."
2-77-1,"After having passed the tenth day of the death of Dasaratha, Bharata having himselfpurified, performed Shraddha* rites on the arrival of the twelfth day."
2-77-2,"On the occasion of Shraddha rites, Bharata gave precious stones, money, a lot ofcooked rice, very valuable clothes and various other kinds of presents to Brahmans."
2-77-3,"In that ceremony performed in honor of the dead king, Bharata the son of Dasarathagave multitudes of white goats, hundreds of cows, servants and servant maids, vehicles and very bighouses to Brahmans."
2-77-4,"Then, at the time of dawn on the thirteenth day, the mighty armed Bharata who camefor clearing up bones and ashes, wept in grief, his throat being choked of sound (because ofcrying) and spoke in great distress the following words, having reached the foot of his father'sfuneral pile (to collect the bones and ashes for their immersion in Sarayu River)."
2-77-5,"O, father! My brother Rama to whose care I was entrusted by you, having gone onexile to the forest, I now become abandoned wholly alone, by you."
2-77-6,"O, king! O, father! Where have you gone, leaving Kausalya the mother whose sonRama, her support, has been sent away from home to the forest?"
2-77-7,"Seeing that spot of collection (of bones), which became reddish brown in colourbecause of ashes, with bones consumed by fire and his father's body having extinguished, Bharatawas depressed and began to cry loudly."
2-77-8,"Miserable as he was to see the spot, Bharata fell weeping on the ground, as a flagstaff fastened by any mechanical contrivance would drop down while being raised in honor of Indrathe god of celestials."
2-77-9,"All his ministers hastily approached Bharata who was virtuous in conduct, as sagesonce rushed to the fallen Yayati at the time of his death."
2-77-10,"Seeing Bharata, Shatrughna was also overwhelmed with grief and while recollectingthe king, fell unconscious on the ground."
2-77-11,"Remembering the many gestures of his father resulting from his loving qualities madefrom time to time, Shatrughna was lamenting (as follows) like one who has lost his wits, bewilderedas he was."
2-77-12,"We are immersed in a violent and appalling ocean of sorrow invoked by Mandhara, inwhich Kaikeyi in the form of a crocodile swam in its current the irrevocable boons granted to herby my father."
2-77-13,"O, father! Where have you gone leaving the lamenting Bharata, your boy always beingcaressed by you."
2-77-14,"You used to fulfill the wishes of all of us, in the matter of eatables, drinks,clothes, and jewels. Who else will do it (now) for us."
2-77-15,"That earth which is deprived of you, the high soled and righteous king, is notriven even when it is the time to be riven."
2-77-16,"The father having obtained heaven and Rama having taken refuge in a forest, what isthe significance of life for me? I shall enter a fire."
2-77-17,"Bereft of my brother and father, I can not return to the deserted city of Ayodhya,where Ikshvaku used to reign. I shall retire to a hermitage."
2-77-18,"Hearing the lamentation of both of them and beholding their plight, all theircompanions were disturbed very much, once again."
2-77-19,"Both Shatrughna, and Bharata were wearied with grief and began to roll on theground, like two bulls whose horns have been broken."
2-77-20,"Then, Vasista, a noble man, a learned man and the family priest of their father,raised up that Bharata from the ground and spoke the following words:"
2-77-21,"O, Lord Bharata! This is the thirteenth day of the death of your father. Why areyou hanging down here, when the ceremony of collecting the bones is still unfinished?"
2-77-22,"The three pairs of opposites (namely hunger and thirst, joy and sorrow; birth anddeath) occur to all living beings without any distinction. They being inevitable, you ought not tobehave like this."
2-77-23,"Even Sumantra, who knew the Truth, raising up Shatrughna and pacifying him, told himabout the origin and dissolution of all beings."
2-77-24,"The two illustrious tigers among men (Bharata and Satrughna) who had got up,appeared like two banners severally raised in honor of Indra (the god of celestials) soiled throughrain and the sun."
2-77-25,"The ministers hurried up the princes, who were wiping their tears and who weretalking pitiably with their eyes reddened (due to excessive weeping) to expedite the other ritespertaining to the thirteenth day."
2-78-1,"Thereafter, Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana spoke the following words toBharata, who was tormented with grief and who desired to undertake an expedition to Rama."
2-78-2,"When that even-minded Rama is a refuge for all beings, how much more to tell aboutour seeking solace to him in our grief? He has been abandoned to the forest by a woman."
2-78-3,"Why the so-called Lakshmana, the strong and powerful man, even could not rescueRama from distress by making our father to restrain from doing it?"
2-78-4,"By perceiving the prudence and imprudence in that wrong course adopted by the king,who has fallen into the clutches of a woman, Lakshmana should have restrained Dasaratha even at thebeginning itself."
2-78-5,"While Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana was talking thus, the hump-backedManthara duly adorned with all types of ornaments, appeared at the eastern gate."
2-78-6,"Anointed with a scent of sandal-wood and wearing royal clothes, she was bedeckedwith several kinds of ornaments of every description in various ways."
2-78-7,"Studded with bright-coloured girdle-bands and many other excellent ornaments,Manthara appeared like a female-monkey tied with ropes!"
2-78-8,"Beholding that hump-backed Manthara, the very much sinful and insensitive woman, thedoor-keepers caught her and delivered her to Shatrughna (with the following words:)"
2-78-9,"Here is that sinful and cruel woman, by whose act Rama is in the forest and yourfather has laid down his body. Do with her, as you consider fitting."
2-78-10,"Hearing those words, Shatrughna who was very much in grief and was firmly resolute,spoke to all those inmates of that gynaecium, as follows:"
2-78-11,"Let this woman, who created serious misfortune to my brothers and my father,receive the fruit of her cruel act."
2-78-12,"Speaking thus in the midst of her companions, he seized that hunch-backed woman withhis powerful hand soon and she in turn made that mansion resound with her shrieks."
2-78-13,"Then, her companion, having conceived Shatrughna's anger and extremely agonised asthey were, ran away helter-shelter in all directions."
2-78-14,"All the company of women there surmised as follows : ""The way how he is coming up,he will surely slay us all"""
2-78-15,"We shall take reguge with the compassionate, magnanimous, virtuous and illustriousKausalya. Let her be the sure asylum for us."
2-78-16,"That Shatrughna, the tormentor of enemies, with his raging red eyes then violentlydragged the crying hump-back along the floor."
2-78-17,"While that Manthara was violently dragged, here various colourful ornaments werescattered asunder here and there on the floor."
2-78-18,"Thus, that splendid royal mansion scattered by those ornaments, appeared very muchlike an autumnal sky studded with innumerable stars."
2-78-19,"Shatrughna, the strong and the eminent man, thus violently seizing her with rage,sharply rebuked Kaikeyi and spoke harsh words to her."
2-78-20,"Agonised very much by those harsh and painful words, Kiakeyi overwhelmed as she waswith the fear of Shatrughna, took refuge with Bharata."
2-78-21,"Seeing that enraged Shatrughna, Bharata said: ""Among all beings women are not to bekilled. Hence she is to be pardoned."""
2-78-22,"If the pious Rama were not to express his displeasure with me for killing themother, I would have killed this Kaikeyi, the ill-mannered and sinful woman."
2-78-23,"If the virtuous Rama hears that the hunch-backed woman has been killed, it is surethat he will cease to talk to you or even to me."
2-78-24,"Hearing the words of Bharata, Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana renouncinghis guilty design forthwith released that Manthara."
2-78-25,"Manthara fell at the feet of Kaikeyi, breathless, weeping piteously."
2-78-26,"Seeing the hunch-backed woman, who was distraught on account of shatrughna'sviolence, wearing a disturbed appearance and looking like a crane that has been caught in a noose,Bharata's mother slowly consoled her."
2-79-1,"Thereafter, early in the morning on the fourteenth day, the king-makers comingtogether, spoke to Bharata the following words."
2-79-2,"Dasaratha, who was our highly venerable master, went to heaven after sending hiselder son Rama and the exceedingly strong Lakshmana to forest."
2-79-3,"O, the highly illustrious prince! From now on, do you be our king. Fortunately,this kingdom has not yet missed the mark, even without a king."
2-79-4,"O, prince Bharata! Taking all the things needed for coronation, your own people(the counsellers and the ministers) as well as the citizens are awaiting for you."
2-79-5,"O, Bharata the excellent among men! Take over the stable kingdom, which came insuccession from your ancestors, coronate yourself and rule us."
2-79-6,"The firmly resolute Bharata performed circumambulation clockwise around all thethings kept ready for consecration and replied to all those people as follows:"
2-79-7,"It is indeed appropriate to bestow kingship always to the eldest of our clan. You,being the conversant people, ought not to tell in this manner to me."
2-79-8,"Our eldest brother, Rama will become the king. I then will reside in the forest forfourteen years."
2-79-9,"Let a great and exceptionally powerful army consisting of all the four limbs bekept ready. I shall bring Rama our elder brother from the forest."
2-79-10,"Keeping in front, all the assembled requisites needed for consecration, I shallproceed to the forest for the sake of bringing back Rama."
2-79-11,"Consecrating him, the tiger among men there itself, I shall surely bring Ramasolemnized in front, as bringing home the sacred fire from a sacrificial rite, after performing itoutside the city."
2-79-12,"I shall not make her, my so-called mother, fulfil her desire. I will reside in theimpassable forest. Rama will become the king."
2-79-13,"Let a path-way be prepared by those skilled in that profession, by leveling theuneven surfaces. Let guards who can easily move in the inaccessible forests accompany us in thepath."
2-79-14,"Hearing Prince Bharata, talking in consideration of Rama's cause, all the peoplereplied in the following illustrious and excellent words:"
2-79-15,"Let the gracious goddess of prosperity abide with you, who are speaking thus,desirous of giving kingdom to Rama the eldest son of the king."
2-79-16,"Hearing those excellent words spoken by the prince close to their ears, tears bornof joy fell from the face and eyes of those venerable men."
2-79-17,"Hearing these words, the people there along with council and the ministers feltcheerful, being relieved of their anxiety and spoke the following words : ""As per your command,devoted men and a group of artisans have been instructed to make the path-way."""
2-80-1,"Then, those able to advise on the nature of soils, those skilled in thread-holdingfor leveling purposes, those who were energetic courageous and attentive in doing their jobs,excavators, mechanics, labourers, carpenters, road-menders, wood-cutters, hollow-makers, menskilled in plastering and white washing, basket makers, tanners and skilled supervisors of worksallied forth in advance."
2-80-2,"That mighty assembly of men gladly setting out to that forest was splendid like anocean on the day of the full moon having a gigantic commotion."
2-80-3,"Men skilled in making roads, furnished with tools of every kin, seeking the companyof men of their own proper place, marched ahead."
2-80-4,"Clearing away rows of creepers and shrubs timber and big rocks as well as variourskinds of trees (which obstructed the way), they carved out a path."
2-80-5,"Some men planted trees in tree-less areas. Some others chopped the existing treeshere and there by means of axes, hatchets and sickles."
2-80-6,"Some other strong men removed sturdy tufts of Virana grass and leveled the unevenplaces here and there."
2-80-7,"Some others filled up wells and extensive pits with earth. Some men leveledlow-lying places all around."
2-80-8,"Then, some men bridged the steams that could be bridged, pulverised the rocks thatcould be pulverised and smashed (the impediments that blocked the flow of water) those which couldbe smashed."
2-80-9,"Many ponds, in various sizes and shapes containing plenty of water resembling seaswere built (by constructing dams on rivulets)."
2-80-10,"In water-scarce areas, excellent wells in various shapes were dug duly decorated allaround with platforms (to rest)."
2-80-11,"That track of the troops, having its surface inlaid with cement, with floweringtrees inlaid with cement, with flowering trees on both sides, inhabited with birds in excitementmaking their sounds, adorned with flags on its either side with its surface sprinkled with water ofsandal-wood fragrance, and decorated with various kinds of flowers, looked very much splendid likethe path of celestials."
2-80-12,"Those officers appointed for execution of the work, as ordered by Bharata,skillfully instructed their work-men and erected a tent which was intended for the great-souledBharata, in a beautiful place abundant with tasty fruits. They further adorned profusely withdecorations, the tent which itself resembled on ornament."
2-80-13,"The connoisseurs erected the tents of the high-souled Bharata at auspicious hours indays when the stars were propitious."
2-80-14,"Those camps, with many breast works of sand, moats surrounding each of them, streetsas resplendent as sapphires, their crowns of terrets, the ramparts covered with stucco to protectthen, the splendid banners, the skillfully laidout avenues, lofty mansions the tops of which wereprovided with dove-cots, which flew about as it were in the air and in splendour, resembled thecapitals of Indra."
2-80-15,"The route thus prepared, extended upto the Ganga River, whose pure and limpidwaters, abounding in great fish, flowed between woods and forests of every kind."
2-80-16,"That beautiful royal high way, which was built gradually by efficient engineers,appeared as resplendent as a night in a clear sky, illumined by the moon with its procession ofstars."
2-81-1,"Then, bards and pangegyrists, who knew the importance of tidings, eulogized Bharatawith auspicious hymns of praise on the night preceding Naandimukha."
2-81-2,"A drum from the sound of which nigh-hours are identified, struck with a goldenstick, gave its sound. Couches and loud-sounding instruments in hundreds producing various types ofnoises were blown."
2-81-3,"That mammoth sound of the musical instruments, as if filling up the whole sky,created further distress and grief to Bharata who was already tormented with grief."
2-81-4,"Then, the awakened Bharata proclaiming that ""I am not the king"", caused to stop thatsound and spoke the following words to shatrughna:"
2-81-5,"Behold, O, Shatrughna! How much harm was done to the world by Kaikeyi! The kingDasartha left us, leaving all sorrows to me."
2-81-6,"This prosperous kingdom of Ayodhya, a foundation of law and religion of thathigh-souled Dasaratha the righteous king is now like boat without a rudder moving hitter andthither in water."
2-81-7,"Even that Rama, who was a great protector has been sent to the forest by this verymother of mine, abandoning her righteousness."
2-81-8,"Seeing Bharata who lost his consciousness by lamenting in that way, all the womenthen miserably cried in one voice."
2-81-9,"While Bharata was lamenting thus, the great illustrious Vasishta who knew the rulesrelating to kings, entered the assembly-hall of Dasaratha the Lord of Ikshvaku dynasty."
2-81-10,"The pious minded Vasishta along with his attendants entered that lovelyassembly-hall, made of gold and studded with gems and jewels, resembling Sudharma the celestialassembly-hall."
2-81-11,"Vasista, who knew all the scriptures, then sat in a presidential chair made of goldand wrapped with a comfortable cushion. He ordered the messengers as follows:"
2-81-12,"Quickly bring Brahmanas (a class of people having divine knowledge), Kshatriyas(people belonging to warrior-class), Vaisyas (agriculturists and traders), ministers and troopcommanders coolly. There is an urgent duty indeed for us to be done."
2-81-13,"Bring Shatrughna with his royal attendants, the illustrious Bharata, Yudhaajit(Bharata's maternal uncle) Sumantra the charioteer and those people who are royal well-wishersthere."
2-81-14,"There was a huge hallooing sound generated while the people invited were coming onchariots, horses and elephants."
2-81-15,"People of high position like ministers and other welcomed the approaching Bharata inevery way as they had welcomed Dasaratha and as Indra was welcomed by celestials."
2-81-16,"That royal assembly, made splendid by Bharata the son of Dasartha, radiated asbefore as with the presence of Dasaratha, like a lake of tranquil waters sown with pearls shellsand sand and filled with great fish and serpents."
2-82-1,"Bharata endowed with understanding, saw that assembly, enriched with the whole bodyof respectable men, looking like a night in full moon duly enriched with well-known planets."
2-82-2,"That excellent assembly was aglow with the brilliance of clothes and scentedcosmetics of its respected members occupying their appropriate seats."
2-82-3,"That beautiful assembly filled with learned men looked like a night with autumn fullmoon."
2-82-4,"Beholding all the entire body of ministers of the king, Vaishta the knower ofrighteousness uttered to Bharata the following soft-spoken words:"
2-82-5,"O, beloved Bharata! The king Dasaratha, practicing righteousness, gave away to youthis wide earth endowed with grains and riches and went to heaven."
2-82-6,"Rama, who was firmly established in truth, remembering the righteousness of goodmen, did not abandon the command of his father, as a raising moon does not abandon themoon-light."
2-82-7,"The kingdom, having its enemies destroy was given to you by your father andbrother. Enjoy it, with its delightful ministers. Get anointed for the kingdom just soon."
2-82-8,"let those living in the north, the Westerners; the southerners the kings of westernborders near the Sahya mountains who are without a throne and the seafaring traders bring crores ofjewels as gifts to you."
2-82-9,"Hearing those words, the pious Bharata was filled with distress and thirsting forjustice got his mind fixed on Rama."
2-82-10,"The youthful Bharata, with a voice of a Hamsa bird, in the midst of the assembly,lamented in a tearful and appealing speech. He even reproached his royal priest as follows:"
2-82-11,"How can a man such as I, rob the throne from one, who practices Brahmacharya(continence and chastity), versed in the science of the Vedas (sacred scriptures) and who isdevoted to duty?"
2-82-12,"How should one born of Dasaratha become the usurper of a crown? Both the kingdomand I myself belong to Rama. You ought to tell the law and justice in this matter."
2-82-13,"Rama, the eldest son, an excellent man, a pious souled and who can be compared withDilipa* and Nahusha*, is eligible to get the kingdom, as with Dasaratha."
2-82-14,"If in this world, I dishonoured the name of Ikshavaku race, I should be guilty of asinful act, practiced by disgraceful men, which does not lead to heaven."
2-82-15,"I do not indeed like that sinful act done even by my mother. From here itself, Ioffer my salutation with my joined palms to Rama who is residing in an impassable forest."
2-82-16,"I will follow Rama's steps. He, who is supreme among men, is the king. Rama iseligible even for the kingdom of the three worlds."
2-82-17,"Hearing those righteous words of Bharata, all the members of the assembly shed tearsof joy, having their minds obsessed of Rama."
2-82-18,"If I am unable to bring back my elder brother from the forest, I shall stay back inthat forest itself, as how the venerable Lakshmana is staying now."
2-82-19,"I shall use every means to bring back compulsorily, that hero before you,practicing virtues, the honourable and the distinguished men."
2-82-20,"All those who are skilled in clearing paths working on and without wages, have beensent by me in advance and the journey so planned, pleases me."
2-82-21,"The pious minded Bharata, who had an affection for his brother spoke as aforesaidand uttered the following words to Sumantra who was clever in giving counsel and who was sittingnearby."
2-82-22,"O, Sumantra! Rise quickly and go. As per my orders, arrange for the jorneyimmediately. Bring the army also."
2-82-23,"Hearing the words of the magnanimous Bharata, Sumantra joyfully arranged all that inaccord with Bharata's orders and wishes."
2-82-24,"Hearing about the expedition of the army too; for arranging of return of Rama, theministers and army-commander there were delighted."
2-82-25,"All the wives of warriors in every house, knowing about the ensuing expedition, werejubiliant and hurried up all their respective husband to setoff for the journey."
2-82-26,"Those army-generals urged the entire army to march forward quickly, with the fastmoving horses, bullock carts with a good speed and the chariots along with the warriors."
2-82-27,"Seeing that army ready, Bharata in the presence of Vasishta said as follows toSumantra who was standing by his side: ""Get ready my chariot quickly."""
2-82-28,"Bowing to the command of Bharata and taking a chariot yoked with excellent horses,Sumantra on his part approached him with delight."
2-82-29,"Bharata, born in Raghu dynasty who was sincere in his purpose a powerful man havingstrong and mighty prowess and whose talk was most appropriate, then spoke as follows: intending (toundertake a journey) to persuade his illustrious elder brother, staying in dreary woods, to returnto Ayodhya."
2-82-30,"O, Sumantra! Rise up and proceed quickly to inform the army-chief to arrange forthe troops. After propitiating that Rama staying in the forest, I want to bring him back to Ayodhyafor the welfare of the people."
2-82-31,"Sumantra, having received that explicit command from Bharata, which fulfilled hishighest hopes, called all the ministers-in-chief, the chiefs of the army and the friendlymultitude."
2-82-32,"Thereupon, from every house, warriors merchants, Shudras and Brahmanas rose up andharnessed their chariots to camels, mules, well-bred elephants and horses."
2-83-1,"Bharata rose up at day-break, mounted on excellent chariot and went quickly with adesire to see Rama."
2-83-2,"All the ministers and priests ascended, chariots yoked with horses, resembling thoseof the sun, and went ahead of Bharata."
2-83-3,"Nine thousand elephants suitably duly arranged escorted Bharata the joy of theIkshvaku dynasty, on his journey."
2-83-4,"Sixty thousand chariots filled with archers, furnished with weapons of variouskinds, followed the illustrious prince Bharata."
2-83-5,"A hundred thousand cavalry accompanied the moving Bharata, born in Raghu dynasty,who was true to his promise and who subdued his senses."
2-83-6,"Kaikeyi, Sumitra and the illustrious Kausalya rode in a resplendent chariot,delighted as they were at the thought of Rama's return."
2-83-7,"The whole body of noble men with their jubiliant hearts followed Bharata to see Ramaagain as also Lakshmana, recounting the marvelous exploits of that hero to each other saying:"
2-83-8,"When shall we see the mighty armed prince, of the hue of dark cloud, whose courageis unshakable, of inflexible purpose Rama, who banished sorrow from the earth?"
2-83-9,"Beholding Rama, our entire sorrow will indeed be dispelled, as darkness of theentire earth is dispelled at the rising of the sun."
2-83-10,"Thus did the citizens of Ayodhya recount happily of Rama's glorious deeds, and theyembraced each other as they went along."
2-83-11,"Those others who were held in high esteem, merchants and all common people proceededmerrily to join Rama."
2-83-12,"Some lapidaries, skilled potters, those who lived by manufacture of arms,carpenters, those who made various articles from peacock-feather, sawyers, workers in artificialornaments, those who pierced gems, pearls etc, those who made articles of ivory, those who lived byperfumery, highly reputed goldsmiths, weavers of blankets and other wollen goods, those whoprovided hot-water baths for other, physicians, distillers and vendors of spirituous liquors,fumigators, washer-men, tailors, chiefs of villages and hamlets, dancers with their women-folk andfishermen started on the journey."
2-83-13,"Thousands of Brahmanas, well-composed, renowned for their virtuous conduct, versedin sacred scriptures and riding on bullock-carts, accompanied Bharata."
2-83-14,"All of them, attired in clean and fair raiment, anointed with pure red sandal-paste,mounted on various kinds of vehicles, followed Bharata tranquilly."
2-83-15,"Exceedingly pleased and cheerful, that army escorted the son of Kaikeyi- Bharta whowas affectionate towards his brother and who had set out along with his family to bring hisbrother, Rama."
2-83-16,"Having gone for a considerable distance in their chariots, carts, horses andelephants, they reached the River Ganga close to the city of Shringaberapura, where the valiantGuha, a bosom friend of Rama along with multitude of relatives was ruling that regioncarefully."
2-83-17,"That army, which was accompanying Bharata, arrived at the bank of Ganga River,looking beautiful as it was with Charka* birds and stopped there."
2-83-18,"Seeing the army behind, which accompanied him and the River Ganga in front with itspropitious waters, Bharata who was skillful in words, spoke to all his officers (as follows):"
2-83-19,"It is my will that my army should take rest by all means. When they are refreshedwe shall cross the river tomorrow."
2-83-20,"Meanwhile, descending into the river, I desire to make offering of the sacred wateras libation for the infinite spirit relating to the state after death, to the king Dasaratha whohas gone to heaven."
2-83-21,"Hearing these words from Bharata, the officers attentively answered, ""Be it so"" andeach of them encamped their respective forces in accord with his pleasure."
2-83-22,"Having meticulously arranged for encampment of the army which looked lovely alongGanga that great river with the surrounding equipment (like tunts, furnishings etc), Bharata haltedthen, reflecting as to how to bring back the magnanimous Rama."
2-84-1,"Just on seeing an army encamped and positioned along the River Ganga, Guha the kingof Nishadas hastily spoke to his relatives as follows:"
2-84-2,"On this side, a huge army is seen like an ocean. I am not able to comprehend theextent of this army even by my discerning mind."
2-84-3,"Here is seen on that chariot, a towering banner bearing Kovidara tree and henceBharata himself with an evil intent seems to have come."
2-84-4,"Will Bharata the son of Kaikeyi bind us with chains or slay us? Or is he coming tokill Rama, the son of Dasaratha, who was exiled from the kingdom by his father, desirous as Bharatais to get the prosperous Ayodhya kingdom, a luxury and that which is inaccessible to another?"
2-84-5,"Rama the son of Dasaratha is my Lord and my companion too. Hence you, covered witharmor, be stationed on this bank of Ganga River, desiring to advance the interest of Rama."
2-84-6,"Let all our ferrymen guarding the river, along with the troops, eating meat rootsand fruits ( in their boats), stay positioned along the River Ganga."
2-84-7,"Let five hundred boats, each manner by a hundred youthful ferrymen, be stationedand made ready -thus announced Guha."
2-84-8,"If Bharata is favourably disposed now towards Rama, then only his army may (beallowed to) cross the River Ganga in safety."
2-84-9,"After uttering thus, Guha the king of Nishadas took fish, meat and honey as anoffering and approached Bharata."
2-84-10,"Seeing him approach, Sumantra the charioteer, a majestic man who knows the rules ofdiscipline, humbly told Bharata as follows:"
2-84-11,"This Lord who is surrounded by a thousand of his own people, is fully acquaintedwith the forest of Dandaka and also an old friend of your elder brother."
2-84-12,"O, Bharata! For that reason, let Guha the king of Nishadas see you. He knows surelywhere those two Rama and Lakshmana - are stationed."
2-84-13,"Hearing the auspicious words of Sumantra, Bharata answered, ""Introduce Guha to mewithout delay."""
2-84-14,"Having obtained permission, Guha along with his own people, joyfully and humblyapproached Bharata and spoke as follows:"
2-84-15,"This place is like a pleasure-grove near your house. We are your subjects and arereporting to you as such. Stay in this servant's house."
2-84-16,"Here are the roots and fruits gathered by my tribe as well as fresh and dried meatof great quality and of various kinds, and all a produce of the forest."
2-84-17,"I hope the army, after eating well, can halt for the night here. Furnished with allyou could desire, you can continue your journey tomorrow along with your troops."
2-85-1,"Bharata thanks Guha for having come forward to offer hospitality to him and his army. He enquires about the proper route to proceed to the hermitage of Bharadvaja. Guha assures Bharata that he along with some of his ferrymen will follow him as guides. When Guha enquires Bharata whether he has an evil intention towards Rama, Bharata clarifies him that he is proceeding to Rama?s place to bring him back to Ayodhya. When night falls Bharata along with Shatrughna and his army take rest. However Guha consoles Bharata, who has been constantly bewailing, till the nightfall."
2-85-2,"Hearing those words, the highly intelligent Bharata replied toGuha, the lord of Nishadas, in words that were full of reason and meaning."
2-85-3,"?O, friend of my elder brother! Indeed, your desire to offerhospitality to my army of such a magnitude, is great.?"
2-85-4,"Having spoken these excellent words to Guha; the greatlyillustrious Bharata, possessed of great splendor, said again to Guha the kingof Nishadas (as follows):"
2-85-5,"?O, Guha! By which of these two routes can I go to the hermitageof Bharadvaja? This region engulfed in waters of Ganga River is not very much easy to negotiate and is difficult to cross.?"
2-85-6,"Hearing the words of the wise prince; Guha, who roams about inwoods, with joined palms answered as follows:"
2-85-7,"?O highly illustrious prince! My ferrymen wielding their bows,and very attentive, will certainly accompany you. I too will follow you (inperson).?"
2-85-8,"?I hope you are not going to attack Rama, who is unwearied inaction. This great army of yours is begetting an apprehension in my mind.?"
2-85-9,"Bharata, whose heart resembled a taintless sky, spoke thefollowing words in smooth voice, to that Guha, who confessed his doubt asaforesaid."
2-85-10,"?Let not such an occasion of wretchedness come! You should neverhave suspected me. That Rama my elder brother is indeed regarded as my father.?"
2-85-11,"?I am going to get back Rama who is now living in the forest. O,Guha! No other apprehension should be made by you. I am telling you the truth.?"
2-85-12,"Hearing the words of Bharata, Guha on his part, with his faceradiated with joy spoke again to Bharata as follows:"
2-85-13,"?You be blessed! I do not see your equal on this earth - you, whowish to renounce the empire you acquired now, even without effort.?"
2-85-14,"Assuredly your fame will traverse permanently in all provinces,as you are the very person who wishes to bring back Rama from his terribleplight."
2-85-15,"While Guha was talking thus to Bharata, the sun diffused lesslight and the night fell."
2-85-16,"The illustrious Bharata, lodging that army in camps, feltdelighted by Guha?s hospitality, returned to his camp and took rest along withShatrughna."
2-85-17,"The high soled Bharata, whose only aim is to fulfill his duty andwho is undeserving of sorrow, indeed felt grief, born of anguish for Rama."
2-85-18,"As a fire is hidden in a hollow tree while a forest is on fire, sodid Bharata?s fire of anguish burn with in his heart."
2-85-19,"Perspiration born of fieriness of grief poured off from all hislimbs, as the snow heated by solar rays melts and flows from Himavat mountain."
2-85-20,"Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi was pressed by the weight of thatcolossal mountain of agony consisting of rocky caverns in the shape of settledcontemplations on Rama, minerals in the shape of groans and sighs, a cluster oftrees in the shape of depressive thoughts, summits in the form of sufferingsand fatigue, countless wild beasts in the shape of swoons, herbs and bamboos inthe form of his exertions."
2-85-21,"Thereafter, Bharata the excellent among men sighing much inmelancholy, his mind utterly confused in consequence, having obtained anextreme distress, afflicted as he was with burning fever in his breast and likea bull strayed from its herd, found no peace."
2-85-22,"The noble soled Bharata, with his escort, met Guha too in acomposed mind. Then Guha slowly reassured Bharata again as regards his elderbrother."
2-86-1,"Then Guha the foremost dweller reported Bharata, who was having incomprehensiblequalities, about the quality of goodness of Lakshmana(as follows):"
2-86-2,"I spoke as follows to that Lakshmana, who is endowed with virtues and wieldingarrows bow and a sword and who was keeping a vigil for the safe guard of his brother."
2-86-3,"O, dear brother! Here is a comfortable bed made ready for you. Feel yourself atease. Rest peacefully on this, O, delight of the Raghu race!"
2-86-4,"All my people are habituated for hardships, o virtuous prince! You are used tocomfort. Hence ,we shall keep awake for the safe guard of Rama."
2-86-5,"None is more dear to me than Rama on this earth. Moreover, do not become restless.I am telling this truth in your presence."
2-86-6,"By the grace of Rama, I wish to attain a very great renown in this earth, anextensive acquisition of righteousness, an unalloyed wealth and enjoyment."
2-86-7,"I as such with a bow in my hand, along with my relatives will guard my dear friendRama, who slept together with Seetha."
2-86-8,"Nothing is indeed unknown to me, who forever wander in this forest. We can defeateven an army consisting of all the four limbs in battle."
2-86-9,"Thus spoken as aforesaid by us the high soled Lakshmana, who perceivesrighteousness alone,politely replied to all of us( as follows)"
2-86-10,"How is it possible for me to get a sleep, or even life or comforts when Rama isreposing on the floor along with Seetha?"
2-86-11,"O, Guha! Behold that Rama, who cannot be conquered in a battle even by all thecelestials and demons, sleeping on the blades of grass along with Seetha."
2-86-12,"This Rama is an excellent son, having qualities equal to those of Dasaratha. Theking obtained Rama by performing a great penance and after facing various troubles."
2-86-13,"When Rama having seen exiled, the king Dasaratha will not survive for long.Thisearth will surely be without a husband soon."
2-86-14,"The women in the gynoecium's, having cried with a great noise, would have ceasedtheir crying out of fatigue. Now, the great noise would have stopped in the royal palace bynow."
2-86-15,"I do not expect whether all of them, like Kausalya Dasaratha and even my motherSumitra will survive at all till this night."
2-86-16,"By beholding Shatrughna, my mother perhaps may even survive. However, the afflictedKausalya who gave birth to the eminent Rama will surely die."
2-86-17,"Without realising his long-cherished wish and failing to install Rama in the kingdomof Aodhya, my father Dasaratha will expire."""
2-86-18,"Those who have accomplished their purpose (Shatrughna and others) will perform allthe funeal honours to king Dasaratha, my father when the time comes for it."
2-86-19,"They will joyfully inhabit my father capital City, with its pleasant cross roadsand meeting places, with its main roads well laid out, sumptuous with large houses and loftymansions, with all the gems they are encrusted, with elephants horses and chariots that aboundthere, the sound of trumpets with which the city resonates, the many diversions it contains, itsproperous and well-fed people, its luxurious gardens and parks as well as the assmeblies andfestivals that continuously take place inti."
2-86-20,"Shall we enter Ayodhya happily along with that virtuous Rama, who has truly redeemedhis promise, when he completed his term of exile?"
2-86-21,"While that magnamimous prince was lamenting thus, standing guard, the nightpassed."
2-86-22,"When the sun rose brightly in the next morning Rama and Lakshmana got their locksof hair matted into a thick mass at the banks of River Ganga and they were safely ferried byme."
2-86-23,"Rama and Lakshmana, who were capable of tormenting their enemies, possessing greatstrength, wearing matted locks of hari and clothes made of bark, like unto the leaders of herd ofelephants, wielding excellent bow, arrows and sword, looking back at me, went away with Seetha."
2-87-1,"Hearing those most disagreeable words from Guha, Bharata began to think deeply,directing his mind on Rama, of whom those unpleasant words were heard."
2-87-2,"That gentle, extremely courageous and the mighty armed young prince, whose shouldersresembled a lion's his large eyes opening like a flowering lotus and having pleasing appearance,momentarily sighed and in his extreme anguish, sank to the ground suddenly like an elephant thathas been wounded in the heart with goads."
2-87-3,"Seeing Bharata unconscious, Guha growing pale, shook like a tree during anearthquake."
2-87-4,"Shatrughna, who stood near, taking Bharata, who was in that unconscious state in hisarms, becoming non-pulsed, cried loudly, overcome as he was with grief."
2-87-5,"Then, all the queens, emaciated through fasting, extremely miserable, being unableto find consolation for the sad end of their lord, rushed towards Bharata."
2-87-6,"All of them, sobbing, surrounded Bharata who fell on the ground. Kausalya on herpart, torn with grief and bending over him, embraced him."
2-87-7,"That affectionate Kausalya, agitated as she was with grief and looking miserable,pressing him to her bosom as a cow its own calf, questioned Bharata (in the following words)"
2-87-8,"O, son! I hope that no ailment afflicts your body. Now, the life of this royal raceis indeed dependent on you."
2-87-9,"O, son! Rama along with Lakshman has gone to the forest. The king Dasaratha isdead. I survive, looking on you. Now, you alone are the protector for us."
2-87-10,"I hope you have not heard any unpleasant news about Lakshmana or about Rama my oneand the only son who left for the forest along with his wife."
2-87-11,"Bharata of great renown, easing himself well within a moment, consoled Kausalya andwhile still weeping, spoke to Guha (as follows)"
2-87-12,"O, guha! Tell me where did Rama my brother as also Seetha and Lakshmana halt in thenight? On what couch and eating what, did he repose?"
2-87-13,"Guha, the Lord of Nishadas, thrilling with rapture, spoke to Bharata about themanner in which he made arrangements for (feeding and reposing) his beloved and kind guest,Rama."
2-87-14,"Various kinds of food and drink and different varieties of fruits were broughtrepeatedly by me to the presence of Rama for the purpose of his consumption."
2-87-15,"Rama, the truly courageous man, refused all of them. Reminding himself of hiswarrior's statute, he could not accept it."
2-87-16,"O, Bharata! We were pacified by that high-souled Rama by saying thus: ' O, friend!We are not allowed to receive anything we must always be givers."
2-87-17,"Rama, of great glory, then along with Seetha drank the water brought by Lakshman asobserved fasting."
2-87-18,"Thereafter Lakshmana also drank the left-over water and those three practisedsilence together in that evening-twilight."
2-87-19,"Lakshmana then personally brought a layer of Kusa grass and arranged a fittinglynice bed with it for Rama immediately."
2-87-20,"Rama, along with Seetha, settled down on that bed. After washing their feet,Lakshmana went away to a distance."
2-87-21,"Here at this fort of Ingndi Tree, on just this grass, on which both Rama and Seethaslept that night."
2-87-22,"Lakshmana, the scourge of his foe, wearing a glove of goha skin, strapping twoquivers full of arrows on either side of his back and wielding a great stringed bow, remained onhis part walking round Rama during that night."
2-87-23,"Wearing excellent arrows and a bow along with my vigilant kinsmen carrying theirbows, I on my part remained near Lakshman, who was guarding Rama who vied with Indra the Lord ofcelestials."
2-88-1,"Having heard all that perfectly, Bharata approached the foot of Ingudi Tree alongwith his ministers and gazed on that grass-bed on which Rama had slept. Thereafter, he said to allhis mothers as follows: ""It is here that the magnanimous hero laid himself for that night, hislimbs pressing the earth."""
2-88-2,"Born of the great and segacious Dasaratha in an illustrious family, Rama verilydoes not desrve to sleep on this bare earth!"
2-88-3,"How could Rama the tiger among men, who used to sleep on a couch horded with richcushions covered with superior hairy skins of antelopes, sleep on a bare floor?"
2-88-4,"Having ever dwelt in palaces, the upper apartments resembling the chariots of thegods and in turrets, furnished with excellent carpets decked with heaps of flowers, perfumed withsandal and aloes, like unto a bright and towering cloud, re-echoing to the cries of parrots,suprassing the finest of palaces, which wre cool and fragrant with perfules, as unto Mount Meruwith its golden walls, where in that palace he was awakened at the fitting time by sogns and musicfrom various instruments, tinkling of ornaments and the excellent sounds of clay tomtoms, glorifiedby many panegyrists, bards and ministrels throught appropriate ballads and songs of praise."
2-88-5,"This ( such a prince becoming like this) is unbelievable in the world and does notappear true to me. My mind is indeed bewildered. I wish that it were a dream."
2-88-6,"Surely even a deity is not a little more powerful than Time (the will of god),since that Rama, the son of Dasaratha has to sleep on the bare ground!"
2-88-7,"Even Seetha the daughter of the king of videha, lovely to look upon and thecherished daughter-in-law of Dasaratha has to sleep on the floor!"
2-88-8,"This is the bed of my elder brother. Here are indeed the blessed marks of hischanging sides, in the form of all the blades of Kusa grass, trampled by his limbs on the hardground."
2-88-9,"I think the blessed Seetha has slept on this bed along with her jewels for, someparticles of gold appear to be stuck up, here and there."
2-88-10,"It is very clear that the upper garment of Seetha got entangled with these bladeshere at that time. That is why, these silk-threads appear stuck to them."
2-88-11,"I think the bed of her husband is sweet to a woman and thought Seetha is young andunfortunate, yet however delicate she be, she would experience no suffering."
2-88-12,"Alas! I am a cruel man because on my account, Rama, like an orphan, along with hiswife slept on such a bed."
2-88-13,"How can Rama, born in the race of monarchs, highly honoured by the entire world,beloved of all the people, having a dark complexion as that of a blue-lotus, having red eyes,lovely to look at who is entittled for comfort and who is not worthy of suffering, sleep on thegound, abandoning excellent kingdom and comfort?"
2-88-14,"Lakshmana, having auspicious marks on his body and an exceedingly lucky man, whoaccompanied his elder brother Rama in times of adversity in indeed a fortunate man."
2-88-15,"Seetha, who went together with her husband to the forest, is indeed an accomplishedwoman. All of us, deprived of the highly virtuous Rama, are an unsettled lot."
2-88-16,"Dasaratha went to heaven. Rama is dwelling in the forest. this kingdom appears tome as a boat without ahelmsman."
2-88-17,"Even if staying in the forest, Rama protects this earth with the power of his arms.Hence, nobdy can think even in his mind, to invade this kingdom."
2-88-18,"Without guards to watch over its ramparts, with its unrestrained horses andelephants, with its city-gates laid open, without any defenders, denuded of its happy army, plungedin desolation in difficulties and exposed, that royal capital of Ayodhya will be shunned likepoisoned food even by the enemies."
2-88-19,"From today onwards, I shall sleep on the earth or on the grass, with my locksmatted, wearing robes of bark and by all means living on fruits and roots."
2-88-20,"For the rest of his exile, on behalf of Rama, I shall dwell cheerfully in theforest, thereby discharging that promise so that the vows of Rama shall not have been made invain."
2-88-21,"Shatrughna will bear company with me, residing in the forest on behalf of Rama. Myelder brother, Rama along with Lakshmana will protect Ayodhya."
2-88-22,"Rama will be enthroned in ayodhya, by Brahmanas the Twice-born! May the gods grantthat my desire be made a reality."
2-88-23,"Should Rama not accept the respectful appeals made in many a way by me, I shallfollow the foot steps of Rama for any length of time he roams about in the forest thereafter. Heought not to refuse this grace to me."
2-89-1,"Bharata, born in Raghu race, having passed the night in that place on the banks ofGanga, rising at dawn, said to shatrughna as follows:"
2-89-2,"O, Shatrughna! wake up! Why sleep longer/ Bring guha the king of Nishadhas quicklyand be happy. Let him convey the army across the river."
2-89-3,"Thus urged by Bhrata, his brother Shatrughna said, ""I am not sleeping. Thinking ofthat Rama alone, I have been wakeful."""
2-89-4,"While those two lions among men were talking themselves with each other thus, Guhacame in time and with joined palms, addressed Bharata saying:"
2-89-5,"O, Bhrata! Did you pass the night happily on the banks of the river? I hope all iswell with your army."
2-89-6,"Hearing those words of Guha spoken with affection, Bharata also in his devotion toRama, replied as follows:"
2-89-7,"O, king! The night passed leasantly fo r us. We were treated hospitably by you. Letyour fisher-men ferry us across Ganga River on your courtless boats."
2-89-8,"Hearing Bharata's command, Guha returned to the city in all haste and spoke to thosemultitude of his people (as follows):"
2-89-9,"Rise, awake and may prosperity ever attend you! Duly haul the boats to the bank.Let us carry the army across the river."
2-89-10,"Rising immediately on hearing the command of their king, they quickly broughttogether five hundred boats from every quarter."
2-89-11,"Some excellent boats, possessing large bells were marked with Sawstika, well-kepttogether with appropriate sails and adorned with flags."
2-89-12,"Then, Guha brought there one boat also adorned with Swastika, was covered with whitecanvas, re-echoing with acclamations and which was beautiful."
2-89-13,"Vasishta, the royal priest and whatever elderly Brahmanas were present thereascended the boats, even before Bharata, Shatrughna, Kausalya, Sumitra. Whatever royal women werepresent also took theri seats. Thereafter followed the king's wives a well as bullock- carts andprovisions."
2-89-14,"The sound of men setting fire to the huts, of those who were descending the stepsleading to the boat and those who were transporting their effects touched the sky."
2-89-15,"Thos boats, adorned with flags, steered by fisher-men themselves ran speedily, dulycarrying those passengers."
2-89-16,"Some were filled with women. Some were loaded with horses and some of them ferriedanimals of draught of great value."
2-89-17,"Having reached the opposite shore, thsoe boats cleared those people and on thereturn journey, the kinsfolk of guha plied them as easily as toy- boats made of bamboo."
2-89-18,"Goaded on by their mahouts, elephants adorned with their flags, swimming across theriver, looked life winged mountains."
2-89-19,"Some ascended boats. Some others crossed the river by rafts in the same manner. Someothers swam across with the help of big and small earthen vessels. The rest swam with arms."
2-89-20,"Having made to cross River Ganga by the fisher-men themselves, that holy armyreached the magnificient woods of Prayaga at the hour of Maitra."
2-89-21,"The high-souled Bharata made the army to rest, by encamping it according to itsinclination and set out along with the priests and king's counsellors to meet Bharadwaja, theforemost of sages."
2-89-22,"Approaching the hermitage of that high-souled Brahmana and the family priest ofgods, Bharata saw an extensive and enchanting grove with its leafy huts and tress the chief ofascatics."
2-90-1,"Having seen Bharadwaja's hermitage at a couple of miles away, that excellent manBharata, knowing what is right, leaving all his army behind, discarding his weapons and ornaments,and wearing simple silken garment, went forwards by foot, proceeded by Vasishta, his spiritualpreceptor."
2-90-2,"Leaving his ministers behind at a visible distance to Bharadwaja, Bharata then wentalong with Vasishta, his spiritual preceptor."
2-90-3,"On seeing Vasishta, Bharadwaja the great ascetic rose quickly from his seat, askinghis disciples to fetch water to wash the hand (of the distinguished guests) with."
2-90-4,"Having met Vasishta and greeted by Bharata, Bharadwaja of great splendour recognizedhim to be a son of Dasaratha."
2-90-5,"Bharadwaja, knowing what is right, offering them both, in order of seniority, waterto wash theri hands and feet with and fruits afterwards, made enquiries concerning the welfare oftheir family."
2-90-6,"Subsequently, Bharadwaja made enquires with both of them as to whether all were wellin the city of Ayodhya, with the army, with the treasury, friends and counsellors. But knowingDasaratha friends and counsellors. But knowing Dasaratha to be dead, he did not speak of theking."
2-90-7,"Vasishta and Bharata in return made enquires with Bharadwaja, if all were well withhis body his sacred fires, his disciples, the trees, the deer and birds in the hermitage."
2-90-8,"The great ascetic Bharadwaja replied, ""All is well"" and spoke the following words toBharata, bound as he was with affection to Rama."
2-90-9,"For what reason have you, who are ruling the kingdom, come here? Tell me all this,for my mind is not getting cleared of doubts."
2-90-10,"That annihilator of enemies, born of Kausalya for the increase of her happiness, hewho with his brother and his wife have been exiled to the forest for a long period, that Rama whois full of glory, through the intrigues of a woman was condemned to dwell in the forest forfourteen years by his father. I hope you do not intend to do any harm to that irreproachable princeand his younger brother in order to enjoy the throne without hindrance."
2-90-11,"Thus spoken to as aforesaid, Bharata with his eyes filled with tears in grief andin a faltering tone, replied to Bharadwaja as follows:"
2-90-12,"If you the Blessed One, regard me like this, I am lost indeed! I cannot conceive ofany harm towards Rama having proceeded from me. do not charge me thus."
2-90-13," I do not approve of what my mother has done when I was away from home. I am notpleased with her nor do I accept her word in this matter."
2-90-14,"I, on my part, came to take back that tiger among men to Ayodhya, after prostratingmyself at his feet and having propitiated him."
2-90-15,"O, venerable one! Believing me to have come for the aforesaid purpose, you ought todo a favour for me. Tell me where Rama the Lord of the world is to be found now?"
2-90-16,"Requested by Vasishta and other priests likewise, Bharadwaja answered Bharata inaffectionate words as follows:"
2-90-17,"O, Bharata the tiger among men! Good manners towards teachers as well as selfcontrol and walking in the footsteps of virtuous men-these qualities are worthy of you, born as youare in the Raghu dynasty."
2-90-18," I was aware of your purpose in your mind. But, I desired to confirm it and it ison this account that I asked you, in order to strengthen you fame immeasurably."
2-90-19,"I know where the virtuous Rama along with Seetha and LakSmana are to be found. Yourelder brother is staying on the great mountain called Chitrakuta."
2-90-20,"You may proceed to that place tomorrow. Stay here today along with your ministers.O, man of great wisdom, who understands legitimate interest and desire! Grant me this desire."
2-90-21,"Bharata of a broad outlook and whose reality (as an admirer of Rama) had now come tobe known, answered thus: ""So be it"". Then, the prince made up his mind to stay for that night inthe hermitage."""
2-91-1,"Seeing he had resolved to halt at that place for the night, the sage Bharadwajaprepared to offer Bharata the son of Kaikeyi the full honours due to a guest"
2-91-2,"Then, Bharata said to Bharadwaja as follows: ""Have you not presented me with waterto wash my hands and feet and offered me this hospitality fitting for a guest in this forest?"""
2-91-3,"Then, Bharadwaja smilingly replied to Bharata as follows: ""I know you possess afriendly disposition and you are pleased with whatever is offered to you."""
2-91-4,"O, Bharata the excellent among men! I wish to offer food to your army. You ought tofulfil my satisfaction in every suitable way."
2-91-5,"O, warrior! Why did you come here, leaving your army at a distance? Why did you notcome to my place with your army?"
2-91-6,"Bharata, with joined palms, replied to Bharadwaja who was rich with austerity in thefollowing words: ""O, venerable one! I have not come here with my army for the fear of displeasingyou."""
2-91-7,"O, Venerable One! Either the king or the prince should always keep away from theplaces occupied by ascetics"
2-91-8,"O, Holy one! Spirited horses, men and rare elephants in rut covering an immensearea are accompanying me."
2-91-9,"Let them not damage the trees, huts and ground and defile the waters of hermitages'- in this thought, I came alone."
2-91-10,"Thereafter Bharata, having been commanded by that great sage to bring the armythere, allowed the army's arrival to the hermitage."
2-91-11,"Meanwhile, entering the fire-sanctuary (the place where the sacrificial fire iskept), sipping water and wiping the lips, Bharadwaja invoked Visvakarma (the architect of gods) inorder to fulfil his duties towards the guests (as follows)"
2-91-12,"I wish to offer hospitality to the guest I summon vishvakarma who is also thedivine carpenter. Let arrangements be made in that connection for me."
2-91-13,"I further invoke the three gods (Yama, Varuna and Kubera) the guardians of theworlds with Indra as their king. I wish to offer hospitality to the guests. Let arrangements bemade in this connection for me."
2-91-14,"Let the rivers which flow towards the east and those which flow towards the west,across the earth and in the aerial region now come together here from all quarters."
2-91-15,"Let some rivers flow with Maireya ( a kind of wine made from date palms etc) someothers flow with highly refined spirituous liquor and some others flow with cool water with a tasteof sugarcane."
2-91-16,"I invoke the celestials and celestial musicians Vishvavasu, Haha and Huhu as alsoApsaras (nymphs) belonging to the celestial and celestial musicians' race from all regions."
2-91-17,"I invoke the celestial nymphs called ghritachi, Vishvachi, Mishra Kesi, Alambusa,Nagadanta and Hema as also Hima who has an abode made in mountains."
2-91-18,"I invoke the fair women who are attending on Brahma the Lord of creation - all ofthem with their external appendages (like musical instruments) along with (their teacher)Tumburu."
2-91-19,"Let that beautiful garden in the region of northern Kuru, presided over by Kubera(the god of riches) always with its leaves which serve as raiment and ornaments, with its fruits inthe form of heavenly damsels appear in this place."
2-91-20,"Many the blessed moon-god (the duty presiding over annual plants) furnish me atthis place, excellent food of every variety, confections, sweets, sauces and syrups."
2-91-21,"May the blessed moon-god furnish me many-coloured flowers which have just fallenfrom the flower-plants or trees, the drinks like wine and others as also various kinds ofmeat."
2-91-22,"That sage Bharadwaja, with his intense meditation, possessing unequal splendour andwith austerity, spoke as follows, in tones befitting proper articulation and pronunciation of thescriptural texts:"
2-91-23,"While that sage Bharadwaja, with joined palms, was meditating with absorption in theeast, all those celestials came one by one."
2-91-24,"Then, a pleasant comfortable and gracious breeze, passing over the mountains ofMalaya and Dardura, began to blw, removing sweat by its influence."
2-91-25,"Thereafter wonderful clouds let loose a rain of flowers, while the sound of divinegongs could be heard on every side."
2-91-26,"Troops of Apsaras (divine nymphs) danced to the melodious rustling of the wind. Theclestials and the celestial musicians sang. Vinas, stringed musical instruments transmitted theirtunes."

2-96-8,"The lordly elephants in the forest, the buffaloes in the great woods and the wildbeasts frightened by lions are suddenly running away in various directions."
2-96-9,"O, Lakshmana! You ought to find out whether it is a king or a prince roaming for ahunt or some other savage beast."
2-96-10,"O, Lakshmana! This mountain is difficult of access even to birds. You ought to findout soon, all this in an accurate manner."
2-96-11,"Lakshmana quickly ascended a Sala tree in flowering and looking towards alldirections, saw towards eastern side."
2-96-12,"Looking in northern direction, Lakshmana saw a huge army, full of chariots, steedsand elephants accompanied by smart foot-soldiers."
2-96-13,"Lakshmana informed Rama about that army which was full of horses, elephants andchariots decorated with flags and spoke the following words also."
2-96-14,"O, honourable brother! Extinguish the fire. Let Seetha occupy a hiding place. Makeyour bow ready with a bow-string and arrows. Wear an armour."
2-96-15,"Rama the tiger among men replied to Lakshmana, saying: ""O, Lakshmana! See, whosearmy do you think is this?"""
2-96-16,"Hearing Rama's words, Lakshmana was irritated like a fire and spoke the followingwords, as though he was wishing to scorch the army."
2-96-17,"Bharata, Kaikeyi's son, having obtained coronation and desirous of making thekingdom free of enemies, is coming here to kill both of us. It is clear."
2-96-18,"The gigantic and glorious tree with superb branches is shining over thereprominently. The ensign bearing the device of a kovidara (pomegranate) tree is shining on thatchariot."
2-96-19,"Among the cavalry, some are cavorting merrily on their swift horses, while othersare beaming with delight, mounted on their elephants."
2-96-20,"O, warrior! Let us take up our bows and ascend the mountain or let us stay hereitself, fully prepared with our weapons in our hands."
2-96-21,"O, Rama! Will that flag with the insignia of a Kovidara tree come into oursubjugation? Can we see Bharata, because of whom a great misfortune has occurred to you, to Seethaand to me?"
2-96-22,"O, Rama the warrior! By the reason of whom you were deprived of an eternal kingdom,such Bharata as a foe who is coming here, deserves to be slain by me."
2-96-23,"O, Rama! I see no sin in slaying Bharata. None is charged with unlawfulness, if onestrikes down an aggressor."
2-96-24,"Bharata is the assailant and his death is legitimate. He being dead, you will rulethe entire earth."
2-96-25,"Let Kaikeyi, who is craving for the kingdom see, with great sorrow, her son slainby me today in battle, as a tree is crushed down by an elephant."
2-96-26,"I shall kill Kaikeyi too along with her friend the hunch-back and otheraccomplices. Let the earth today be relieved of a great sinner."
2-96-27,"O, warrior bestowing an honour! Today in the concentrated fury that injustice haskindled I shall scatter the enemy - battalions as a fire consumes the dry wood."
2-96-28,"Today, with my sharpened arrows, I shall slay the bodies of my foes and make thisforest of Chitrakuta overflow with blood."
2-96-29,"The elephants and horses whose breasts were laid open with my darts and the men toostruck down by me, be dragged about by savage beasts."
2-96-30,"By killing Bharata together with his army in this great forest, I shall dischargemy debt to my bow and arrows."
2-97-1,"Rama on the other hand, pacifying Lakshmana (son of Sumitra), who was very muchagitated and infatuated with anger, spoke the following words:"
2-97-2,"While Bharata, wieldin a bow and highly wise-man himself is coming here, what isthe use of a bow or sword with a shield?"
2-97-3,"O, Lakshmana! Having promised to make our father's wish a reality. What shall I dowith the kingdom by acquiring an ill-fame in killing Bharata who came here to see me?"
2-97-4,"I should not enjoy the spoils obtained by slaying a relative or friend, like thepartaking of a poisoned food."
2-97-5,"O, Lakshmana! It is for your sake I desire virtue, legitimately acquired wealth andpleasure or even the earth itself. I promise this to you."
2-97-6,"O, Lakshmana! I desire the throne only for the protection and happiness of mybrothers. I touch my weapon and swear this fact."
2-97-7,"This earth, bounded by the sea is not hard to obtain for me, O the excellent man! Ido not indeed wish even the position of Indra by unrighteousness."
2-97-8,"If there be happiness that I could enjoy without Bharata or you or withoutShatrughna, may it be without Shatrughna, may it be burnt to ashes by fire, O thehonour-giver!"
2-97-9,"I think Bharata was back to Ayodhya, with full of affection for his brothers. He isdearer to me than my life- he who is mindful of the duties of his race. Hearing of my exile andthat I was wearing matted locks and the antelope skin, accompanied by Seetha and you, O mostvaliant of warriors, in his devotion towards me and due to the distress that troubles his mind,Bharata has come to see me. He has not come with any other motive."
2-97-10,"Getting angry with Kaikeyi his mother and speaking unkind and harsh words to her,the glorious Bharata after getting permission from our further, came here to bestow kingdom tome."
2-97-11,"This is the proper time for Bharata to come here and see us. He does not behave oreven think unkindly towards us."
2-97-12,"Has Bharata at any time done any harm to you previously? What so the reason for youto be so apprehensive of Bharata now?"
2-97-13,"Indeed, Bharata must not hear harsh or disagreeable word from your lips. If anaffront is offered to him, it is offered to me!"
2-97-14,"O, Lakshmana! How should a son strike his father, even in a distress or a brotherstrike a brother who is as dear to him as his life?"
2-97-15,"If you are uttering these words for the sake of the kingdom, I shall tell Bharatato give the kingdom to you, when I see him."
2-97-16,"O, Lakshmana! When Bharata receives this command from me, Cede the empire to him"",he will answer, So, be it."""
2-97-17,"At these words spoken by his honourable brother, to whom he was devoted, abashed,shrank into himself."
2-97-18,"Listening to these words ashamed, answered: ""I think that our father Dasaratha camehere to see you himself."""
2-97-19,"Observing the emberassed , Rama said, ""I think the mighty armed Dasaratha came hereto see us."""
2-97-20,"Or rather, to my mind, as he knows that we have been accustomed to comfort,reflecting that we are dwelling in the forest, he wishes to take us home."
2-97-21,"The glorious Dasaratha, my father possibly will take back Seetha from the forest,she who has ever lived in the heart of prosperity."
2-97-22,"O, warrior! See those two excellent horses of noble breed, shining attractively andvying with the wind in swiftness."
2-97-23,"Here is that colossal elephant who is moving at the head of the army calledShatrunjaya, the aged companion of our sagacious father."
2-97-24,"O, the mighty armed! But I do not see that white heavenly canopy of our father,well known insignia in the world. An apprehension on this point is created in my mind."
2-97-25,"O, Lakshmana! You get down from the top of the tree. Act on my word. Thus spokethe virtuous Rama to that Lakshmana."
2-97-26,"Descending from the top of that Sala tree, Lakshmana the victorious in battle, withjoined palms, stood by the side of Rama."
2-97-27,"Commanded by Bharata that no trampling of army should be made in the hermitage ofRama, the army was encamped round the mountain."
2-97-28,"That royal army of Ikshvaku race, crowded with elephants horses and chariots wasencamped around the edge of the mountain occupying an area of one Yojana and a half."
2-97-29,"Brought by the virtuous Bharata, who laid aside his arrogance, placing therighteousness in forefront in order to propitiate Rama, that army showed itself to be disciplinedin the vicinity of Chitrakuta."
2-98-1,"After encamping the army, the mighty Bharata the excellent among men, sought toapproach on foot, Rama who was complying with the words of his father."
2-98-2,"Soon after encamping the army in a well-behaved manner per the guidelines, Bharataspoke the following words to Shatrughna:"
2-98-3,"O, gentle brother! You, along with a troop of men and trackers, ought to search onall sides of this forest."
2-98-4,"Let Guha search for Rama and Lakshmana in this forest, himself accompanied by amultitude of his kinsmen, duly wielding their bows, arrows and swords."
2-98-5,"I too, surrounded by the ministers, citizens, priests and Brahmanas; shallpersonally go round the entire forest on foot."
2-98-6,"Peace will not be with me until I do not see Rama or the very mighty Lakshmana orthe illustrious Seetha."
2-98-7,"Peace will not be with me until I do not see the auspicious face of my elderbrother, resembling the moon and having eyes bearing resemblance to lotus-leaves."
2-98-8,"Peace will nt be with me until I do not hold firmly on my head, the soles of myelder brother, bearing royal insignia."
2-98-9,"Peace will not come to me until my elder brother, who is eligible for the crown, isnot installed in the kingdom of Ayodhya, which was derived from our father and grand father andconsecrated by sprinkling water on his head (as a symbol of crowing the kingdom)."
2-98-10,"Lakshmana, who is seeing regularly the face of Rama having a great luminanceresembling the bright moon and having lotus eyes, is indeed an accomplished man."
2-98-11,"Seetha, the illustrious daughter of Janaka, who is following the steps of Rama theLord of the earth extending to the sea, has fulfilled her object."
2-98-12,"That enchanting mountain of Chitrakuta resembles the King of Mountains on whichRama is residing, as Kubera the Lord of riches is living in the garden of Nandana."
2-98-13,"Blessed is this dense forest, inhabited by wild animals, where Rama, the greatwarrior and the excellent man among the wielders of weapons, dwells."
2-99-1,"Having stationed his forces, Bharata set out eagerly to see his brother, pointingout the sign of Rama's habitation to Shatrughna."
2-99-2,"Bharata, who was affectionate towards the elders, asked the sage Vasishta to bringhis mothers soon thereafter and went ahead quickly."
2-99-3,"Sumantra also, equally desirous of seeing Rama; followed Shatrughna at a littledistance."
2-99-4,"While the illustrious Bharata passed on, he observed in that wood of ascetics, aleafy hut of his brother together with a small hut made of leaves, nearby."
2-99-5,"Bharata then beheld wood that had been broken up and heaps of flowers gathered infront of that hermitage."
2-99-6,"While coming to the hermitage, Bharata saw some signs here and there serving as aproper direction to that hermitage, tufts of Kusha grass and strips of bark tied to the trees byRama and Lakshmana."
2-99-7,"Bharata also saw in the vicinity great heaps of dried dung of deers and buffaloes,kept ready for protection against cold."
2-99-8,"Then, proceeding further, the valiant and the mighty armed Bharata spoke toShatrughna in joy, as also those ministers who surrounded him."
2-99-9,"I think we have reached the place about which Bharadwaja directed us. I believeMandakini River is not far from here."
2-99-10,"These pieces of bark have been tied up from above. This may be the path provided assigns by Lakshmana in order to find his way back in odd hours of darkness."
2-99-11,"At the side of the mountain, this is a roaming place of elephants, having hugeteeth, violent as they are and ferociously roaring at each other."
2-99-12,"See this intense smoke coming from that fire which the sages in the forest alwaysdesire to keep in their hermitages."
2-99-13,"Here, I can see joyfully Rama, the tiger among men, who gives respect to elders andis as venerable as a sage."
2-99-14,"Proceeding for a while on Chitrakuta mountain and reaching the River Mandakini, thatBharata said to his ministers and others as follows:"
2-99-15,"The foremost of men and the Lord of the people, having sought seclusion, sat on thefloor, delighted as he was in the posture of a hero (with his left foot placed on his right knee).O Fie unto my birth and life!"
2-99-16,"Rama the Lord of Men with great luster, has been overtaken by this misfortunebecause of me and leaving all enjoyments, is living in the forest."
2-99-17,"Thus abhhored by the world, I will fall on the feet of Rama, Seetha and Lakshmanaand seek to regain Rama's grace."
2-99-18,"As Bharata was lamenting thus, he beheld in that forest, a splendid and sacred leafyhut, which was covered with many soft leaves of Sala, Tala and Asvakarna trees, overspread withblades of Kusa grass in a sacrificial performance, appearing like an extensive altar and it wasadorned with bows plated with gold, like unto the weapons of Indra the Lord of celestials,constructed for heroic exploits, having great power, the torments of their foes, graced withfearful arrows in their quivers, like unto the rays of the sun, bright as serpents with shininghoods, in the same way of Bhagavati (the realm of Nagas), decked with a couple of swords encased insheaths of gold, adorned with two shields decorated with flowers of gold, finger-guards embroideredwith gold and in different colours suspended on walls and which hut was unassailable by hordes ofenemies as is a lion's cave to deer."
2-99-19,"Bharata saw a sacrificial altar in the north-east corner having a steep descent,extensive in area and having a sacred fire burned in the hermitage of Rama."
2-99-20,"Looking around for a moment, Bharata beheld his elder brother, Rama himself seatedin the hut, wearing matted locks."
2-99-21,"Bharata saw that Rama clad in an antelope-skin and robes of bark, seated close by,resembling a fire (in brilliance), with the neck and shoulders of a lion, mighty arms and eyesresembling the lotus, the very virtuous Lord of the Earth extending upto the ocean, the EternalBrahma, and seated on the ground spread with Darbha grass, with Seetha and Lakshmana."
2-99-22,"Beholding him, the illustrious and the high-souled Bharata the son of Kaikeyimdistraught by the grief that possessed him, rushed towards Rama."
2-99-23,"On seeing his brother, Bharata broke into lamentations and in a voice strangled with sobs, unable to restrain his agony with firmeness, said:"
2-99-24,"My elder brother who is fit to be honoured in an assembly by a body of ministersaround him, is now being served by a body of wild beasts around him in this jungle."
2-99-25,"That magnanimous hero, who formerly used to possess countless articles of apparelis now wearing two antelope-skins, following ascetic righteousness."
2-99-26,"How this Rama, who used to wear various kinds of colourful flowers, is bearing thisburden of matted locks now?"
2-99-27,"He who acquired merit through countless sacrifices performed according to theprescribed injunctions, now follows the path of righteousness through asceticism!"
2-99-28,"He whose body was formerly rendered fragrant by white sandal paste, has only dustwith which to smear the limbs of this venerable elder brother!"
2-99-29,"Rama who used to have happiness, has fallen into this misfortune, because of mecursed be my reprehensive existence that the whole world condemns!"
2-99-30,"Thus did that pitiable Bharata lament, perspiration be-dewing his lotus-likecountenance and, without touching Rama's feet, fell down grooming."
2-99-31,"Overcome with grief, the highly valiant prince Bharata cried out ""O, Noble One!""once and in his distress, was unable to speak anything further."
2-99-32,"Crying at the top of his voice, ""O, Noble One"" only, on seeing the illustrious Rama,he was unable to speak further, his throat choked with tears."
2-99-33,"Shatrughna too, weeping, threw himself at Rama's feet and Rama too, embracing themboth, allowed his tears to fall."
2-99-34,"Then, in that forest, the princes Rama and Lakshmana were seen by Sumantra and Guha,as in the sky, the sun and the moon are seen in conjunction with Venus and Jupiter."
2-99-35,"All those dwellers in the woods, seeing those princes resembling leaders ofelephant-herbs meeting together there in that great forest, losing their cheerfulness, began toshed tears."
2-100-1,"Rama saw Bharata, with matted locks, wearing bark-robes and, with joined palms,lying on the ground, incapable of being seen as the sun at the time of the dissolution of theworld."
2-100-2,"Rama recognized with some difficulty his brother Bharata, whose face became pale andwho was emaciated, and took him by the arm."
2-100-3,"Smelling the crown of his head, placing him on his lap, Rama who was born in Raghudynasty embraced Bharata and with an absorbent mind, enquired of him as follows:"
2-100-4,"My darling! Where is our father, that you have come to the forest? He, being alive,you ought not have to come to the forest."
2-100-5,"I see you after a long time, coming from a far-off distance, wearing a mournfulface into this forest Alas! Why have you come to the forest, my darling?"
2-100-6,"My dear brother! Is the king alive, that you have come here? I hope the miserableking has not indeed departed to the other world, all of a sudden."
2-100-7,"O, gentle brother! I hope the eternal kingdom has in a no way suffered from youryouthful experience. My darling! Are you rendering service to our father, who is trulyvaliant?"
2-100-8,"I hope that the King Dasaratha is well, he who is true to his promise, he whoperforms Rajasuya and Ashvamedha Sacrifices and he who has a righteous resolve."
2-100-9,"My darling! Are you treating respectfully as before that preceptor of theIkshvakus, the one who knows the sacred scriptures, the one who knows the sacred scriptures, thelearned who constantly keep up the virtues and he who has a great splendour?"
2-100-10,"My darling! I hope that Kausalya and Sumitra having good offspring are happy. Ihope the venerable queen Kaikeyi is rejoicing."
2-100-11,"I hope that the preceptor (Suyajgna the son of Vasishta); who is rich in humility,a son of a noble family, who has a knowledge of many scriptures an unenvious person and who is fullof insight, is duly honoured by you."
2-100-12,"I hope that a brahmin who is versed in the traditions, who is intelligent and just,employed in your sacred fires, always informs you in time, about a sacrificial fire having been orgoing to be fed with oblations."
2-100-13,"My darling! I hope that you are holding in high esteem the gods, your ancestors,dependents and teachers of your father's age the doctors and the brahmins."
2-100-14,"O, my darling! I hope that you treat with due respect; Sudhanva, your teacher inarchery, who is furnished with the most excellent arrows and darts and well-versed in politicaleconomy."
2-100-15,"I hope that ministers who are valiant like you, learned, masters of their senses ofnoble birth and skilled interpreting internal sentiments by external gesture, are assigned toyou."
2-100-16,"The source of victory for kings indeed comes from a concealed counsel by ministers,who are well-versed in political sciences and who can hide their thoughts within themselves."
2-100-17,"I hope you do not fall a prey to excess of sleep and do wake up at appropriatetime. I hope you contemplate during the later half of the night, about the adroitness of anaction."
2-100-18,"I hope that you do not deliberate alone nor indeed with numerous men. I hope yourdecision arrived at by you through such deliberation does not flow to the public (even before it iscarried out)."
2-100-19,"O, Bharata! I hope considering your interest fully, you lanuch an undertaking,which has maximum benefit with minimum coast and indeed do not delay it further."
2-100-20,"I hope the other kings know your entire undertakings only after they have beensuccessfully completed as well as those which have taken a shape, but not your proposedundertakings."
2-100-21,"My darling! I hope that others are not knowing, by their enquiries or strategies orby any other approaches not mentioned, the details of discussions you make with yourministers."
2-100-22,"I hope you solicit for one wise man rather than for a thousand stupids for, a wiseman can be of a great help to you in difficult matters."
2-100-23,"Even if a king employs thousands or tens of thousands of fools, they will not behelpful to him."
2-100-24,"Even one wise, valiant sagacious and efficient minister alone can cause to secure agreat prosperity to the king or to one who enjoys royal authority."
2-100-25,"I hope that superior servants are assigned superior works only, mediocre servantsin mediocre works and inferior servants in inferior works."
2-100-26,"I hope you are appointing those ministers, who are eminent incorruptible, born ofthe fathers and for bears of good family and who are full of integrity in matters of greatimportance."
2-100-27,"O, Bharata! I hope your ministers do not watch as mere witnesses, while yoursubjects in the kingdom wielding tremble with great fear, under your inflexible wielding of thescepter."
2-100-28,"I hope those who perform the sacrifice do not hold you in contempt, as one whoaccepts terrible gifts; as one who is fallen, as women hold in contempt of those highly lustfulmen."
2-100-29,"He, who does not slay a physician skilled in ways and means of aggravating adisease, a servant intent on bringing disgrace and a valiant warrior seeking kingly power, is*himself) slain by them."
2-100-30,"I hope an army-chief, who is cheerful, wise, courageous, valiant, well-behaved,born in a good family, who is beloved by his subordinates and efficient, is selected by you."
2-100-31,"I hope those warriors, who are excellent strong, skilled in war-face, whoseexcellent actions were seen before and the most courageous ones are duly honoured and respected byyou."
2-100-32,"I hope you are regularly giving your army, the daily provisions and the suitablesalary to them, without any delay."
2-100-33,"When there is delay in giving bread and wages, the servants become incensed againsttheir master and become corrupt; and that is said to be a great unfortunate occurrence."
2-100-34,"I hope all the foremost descendents of your race (kshatriyas) are devoted to youand do they lay down their lives steadfastly for your sake?"
2-100-35,"I hope that a knowledgeable man, living in your own country, a wise man a skilledperson endowed with presence of mind and the one who knows how to speak to the point, is selectedas an ambassador by you."
2-100-36,"Do you get to know throught three spies, each unacquainted with each other, aboutthe eighteen* functionaries of the enemies and the fifteen functionaries of your own side?"
2-100-37,"O, slayer of your Foes! I hope you do not forever think lightly of your foes, whoare weak and having been expelled, return again."
2-100-38,"I hope are not honouring the materialistic brahmins, My dear brother! These men areskilled in perverting the mind, ignorant as they are and thinking themselves to be learned."""

2-100-40,"I hope you preserve the City of Ayodhya, furnished with everything and flourishing,that was formerly inhabited by our heroic ancestors, O my dear brother, that is worthy of its name,with its fortified gates, its elephant horses and chariots that fill it, with its brahmins,warriors and merchants in thousands, ever engaged in their respective duties, with its noblecitizens self-controlled and full of energy, with its palaces in various shapes and the learned whoabound there."
2-100-41,"I hope that the kingdom, adorned with peaceful places rich in temples and shedswhere water stored for distribution to passers-by in tanks, with happy men and women, graced bysocial festivities, with land well-tilled, abiding in cattle which are totally free from cruelties,the agricultural land not exclusively fed by rains, which is beautiful and is purged of beasts ofprey, which is completely rid of fears, studded with mines, a destitute of sinful men, andwell-protected by our fore-fathers, is prosperous and an abode of happiness."

2-100-44,"I hope you are pacifying the women well. Are they protected by you? I hope you arenot believing the words of these women and not telling them the secrets."
2-100-45,"Are you supervising the woods inhabited by elephants? I hope female elephants arethere to you in good number. I hope you are not simply satisfied with the existing population offemale elephants, horses and male-elephants."
2-100-46,"O, Prince! Do you, regally adorned, appear before the people on rising eachmorning, on the great high way?"
2-100-47,"I hope that all your servants, in your presence, do not adopt a disrespectfulattitude or on the other hand all of them do not hasten away on seeing you. Ofcourse, a middlecourse only in the principle to be followed in this matter."

2-100-53,"O, Bharata! I hope that your well-educated ministers examine a case dispassionatelywhen a contention occurs between a rich man and a poor man, after studying the situationcarefully."
2-100-54,"The tears fallen from those who are the victims of false accusations, O Bharata,destroy their sons and herds of those who are indifferent to justice, merely for the sake ofpleasure."
2-100-55,"I hope that you seek to conciliate by the following three means, viz. gifts, aloving mind and polite words- the aged, the children and the foremost physicians."
2-100-56,"I hope you greet your teachers, the elderly, the ascetics, the deities; theunexpected visitors, the trees standing at cross roads and all the brahmins of auspicious life andconduct."

2-100-63,"Do you find advantages in your study of Vedas? Are your acts, production of fairresults? Do you benefit from the company of your consorts? Has your learning been fruitful?"
2-100-64,"O, Bharata! I hope that your conviction, is the same as mentioned by me in theforegoing verses, which is conducive to long life, fame, religious merit, enjoyment andwealth."
2-100-65,"Do you follow the common practice, which our fore fathers observed and which is inaccord with the path of the virtuous and which is distinguished in itself."
2-100-66,"I hope you do not eat by yourself nicely made eatable and do you share it with yourfriends, who seek it?"
2-100-67,"A wise and learned king, having obtained and ruled the entire earth, properly byrighteousness and by administering justice to the people, indeed ascends to heaven when detachedfrom the mortal body."
2-101-1,"Rama along with Lakshmana, his younger brother, began to question Bharata, hisbrother who was devoted to elders (as follows):"
2-101-2,"I desire to hear from you, why you have come tot his place in robes of bark and anantelope-skin."
2-101-3,"You ought to tell me all about the purpose for which you entered this place, cladin deer-skin and matted hair, relinquishing the kingdom."
2-101-4,"Thus questioned by the high souled Rama, by closely embracing him again, Bharatawith joined palms answered as follows:"
2-101-5,"O, noble brother! Our father the mighty armed, after performing a deed mustdifficult to perform, and having abandoned us has gone the divine region; he died of grief onaccount of separation from his son."
2-101-6,"O, tormented of foes! As urged by his wife and my mother Kaikeyi;, our fathercommitted this great sin that has taken away his own reputation."
2-101-7,"Without having plucked the fruit of kingdom, widowed and emaciated with grief mymother will fall into the most terrific hell."
2-101-8,"Grant me, who am your true servant, a favour! This very day, as Indra the Lord ofcelestials himself, receive the royal anointing!"
2-101-9,"Grant all these people and these widowed Queens, who have come here to see you,this felicity!"
2-101-10,"O, Prince! For that reason, accept the throne that is befitting; endowed to you asper succession and that is yours by right fulfill, as your should, the desires of yourfriends."
2-101-11,"Bring the widowhood of the entire world to an end by becoming her Lord, as does theimmaculate moon to the autumn-night."
2-101-12,"Grant this grace to your brother, who prostrates at your feet along with yourministers is both your discipline and your slave."
2-101-13,"O, Tiger among men! You cannot disregard this unbroken kingdom, which is eternal,ancestral and honoured."
2-101-14,"Thus speaking, the mighty armed Bharata, with tears, once again seized Rama's feetin great honour, as per precept."
2-101-15,"Rama embraced his brother Bharata, who sighed again and again like an elephant inrut, and spoke as follows:-"
2-101-16,"How should a man of noble birth, rich in Sattva (goodness), dignified and who hasobserved sacred vows like myself, commit sin for the sake of a mere kingdom?"
2-101-17,"O, Bharata the annihilator of enemies! I do not see the slightest fault in you andyou should not reproach your mother for a childish action."
2-101-18,"O, Bharata the highly intelligent and the faultless man! It is incumbent always onthe part of the elders to act freely with reference to their wives and progeny."
2-101-19,"O, gentle brother! Since it was said thus by virtuous men in this world, we shouldall, women children and disciples, obey our Lord; this must be known to you."
2-101-20,"The great king is the master, who has a discretion either to make me reside in theforest, wearing bark robes and a black antelope skin or to sit on the throne, O gentlebrother!"
2-101-21,"O, excellent among the supporters of law and the virtuous! The same degree ofrespect is to be paid to our mother, as is due to our father, who is honoured by all."
2-101-22,"How can I do otherwise, while both my parents of virtuous nature ask me to go tothe forest?"
2-101-23,"It is for you to occupy the throne in Ayodhya that the world reveres and it is forme to occupy this Dandaka forest, wearing bark robes."
2-101-24,"Having commanded thus, the emperor Dasaratha with a great splendour, made thedivision of duties in this manner (for us two) in the presence of the people and then ascended toheaven."
2-101-25,"That pious souled king, the preceptor of the world is the standard authority foryou and you have to enjoy the share given by our father accordingly."
2-101-26,"I, for my part, shall enjoy the share given to me by our high-souled father forfourteen years, taking my abode in Dandaka forest, O gentle brother!"
2-102-1,"Hearing Rama's words, Bharata replied as follows: ""What will the discharge of royalduties amount to me, who is outside of that code?"""
2-102-2,"O, the foremost of men! O, Majesty! It has been ever the established tradition inus that while the elder son is there, the younger one cannot become a king."
2-102-3,"O, Rama! Therefore, come to the prosperous Ayodhya along with me and get anointedin kingdom for the welfare of our race."
2-102-4,"The king, whom people speak of as a human being and whose conduct is in conformitywith righteousness and worldly prosperity, they declare as super- human, is conceded by me as agod-head."
2-102-5,"While I was there in Kekaya kingdom and you had proceeded tot he forest, the kingDasaratha, the revered one who was given to the performance of sacrifices and was honoured by thevirtuous, has gone to heaven."
2-102-6,"Hardly were you gone with Seetha and Lakshmana, than the king succumbed tomisfortune and grief and ascended to the most sacred heaven."
2-102-7,"Arise, O the Tiger among men! Let the traditional libations of water be offered toour father. Shatrughna and I have previously done it."
2-102-8,"O, Rama! It is said that the one given by an affectionate son becomes measurelessand you undoubtedly are beloved to our father."
2-102-9,"Entirely abandoned by you, lamenting about you, desirous of beholding you, beingnot able to turn away his mind absorbed in you alone, immersed in grief of you and recollectingyou, your father died."
2-103-1,"Hearing those mournful words relating to the death of his father, spoken by Bharata,Rama fainted away."
2-103-2,"Hearing that unpleasant thunder bolt of words spoken by Bharata, like a thunderboltreleased by Indra the Lord of celestials in a battle, Rama the tormentator of his enemies,stretched forth his hands and fell on the ground, in the same manner as a tree covered atextremities with blossoms was cut off by an axe in the forest."
2-103-3,"Seeing Rama lying on the earth, has the lord of the earth, like an elephant crushedby a land slide on a bank where he was sleeping, those brother along with Seetha approached himfrom all sides and weepingly sprinkled water on him."
2-103-4,"Coming to his senses again and tears falling from his eyes, Rama began to speak muchplaintively."
2-103-5,"Hearing that the King and his father had ascended to heaven, the virtuous. Ramaspoke the following words, consistent with righteousness to Bharata."
2-103-6,"What should I do with Ayodhya, now that my father reached the end of his life? Whowill rule that Ayodhya, which is bereft of that excellent king?"
2-103-7,"In my misfortune, what can I do for that high-souled one? He died of grief on myaccount and I did not perform the last rites for him!"
2-103-8,"O, Bharata the faultless one! Alas! Happy are you, by whom as well as by Shatrughnathe king was honoured by all obsequial rites!"
2-103-9,"'Even after the end of my exile, I do not want to return to Ayodhya which is i adisarranged state, deprived of a chief and made bereft of a king."""
2-103-10,"O, Bharata the tormentator of foes While our father has gone to the other world,who will counsel me when my exile in the forest is over?"
2-103-11,"Formerly, seeing my good conduct, our father used to address me in words of praise;from whom now shall I hear those words delightful to the ears?"
2-103-12,"Having spoken thus to Bharata, Rama went to seek out his consort, whose faceresembled the full moon, and overwhelmed with grief, spoke to her as follows:-"
2-103-13,"O, Seetha! your father-in-law is dead. O, Lakshmana! You have become bereft of yourfather. Bharata is informing a sorrowful news of the emperor being dead."
2-103-14,"While Rama was uttering those words, copious tears caused to flow then from the eyesof those sons of Dasaratha."
2-103-15,"Then, all those brothers consoled Rama very much and said to him, ""Let us offerlibations of water for our father, the Lord of the earth."""
2-103-16,"Hearing that her father-in-law, that great monarch had ascended to heaven, Seethawas unable to see her husband through eyes filled with tears."
2-103-17,"Rama consoled that Seetha who was weeping and himself stricken with grief, spoke tothe lamenting Lakshmana as follows:"
2-103-18,"Bring the crushed pulp of Ingudi Tree and bring a piece of bark for being wrappedabout my loins and another for being used as my loins and another for being used as an uppergarment, so that we may proceed to offer libations of water for our magnanimous father."
2-103-19,"Let Seetha walk in the front and you follow after her nearby. I shall follow in therear. This indeed is the most terrible procession."
2-103-20,"Then, their faithful companion Sumantra versed in the spiritual science, endowedwith great intelligence, kind, self-controlled and glorious, and deeply devoted to Rama, consolinghim and his brothers, took Rama by the hand and helped him descend to the auspicious RiverMandakini."
2-103-21,"The illustrious Rama and others painfully reached the River Mandakini, that streamof sacred fords, the enchanting one always covered with flowers, coming to a blessed ford, freefrom mud and offered the lustrual water to the king, saying ""Father! May this prove agreeable toyou."""
2-103-22,"Holding together in the form of a hollow his palms full of water and turning hisface turned towards the southern quarter and weeping the great prince pronounced the traditionalwords saying:"
2-103-23,"O, Tiger among men! May this water without taint and incorruptible at the momentthat I offer it to you, reach you in the region of your ancestors where you are."""
2-103-24,"Thereafter, the glorious Rama, resending the bank of Mandakini River along with hisbrothers, offered balls of food to his father."
2-103-25,"Rama placed the pulp of the Ingudi tree mixed with the pulp of plums on a mat ofKusa grass and overcome with sadness, weeping, spoke the following words:"
2-103-26,"O, Great King! Be pleased to partake of this, which we eat for, that which maneats, is also consumed by his gods."
2-103-27,"Rama the tiger among men then re-ascending by the same path on the banks of theriver reached the charming summit of Chitrakuta mountain."
2-103-28,"Gaining the door of his leafy hut, Rama the Lord of the earth then embraced Bharataand Lakshmana with his arms."
2-103-29,"From the sound of the cry of those brothers with Seetha, which resembled like theroaring of lions rose an echo in the mountain."
2-103-30,"Hearing the tumultuous clamour by those mighty heroes as, weeping they completed thelibations of water to their father, Bharata's army got alarmed."
2-103-31,"Those troops of Bharata also said, ""Assuredly, Bharata has joined Rama and this is agreat sound only of their wailing, as they mourn for their dead father."""
2-103-32,"Leaving their tents all of them having but one thought, went running in thedirection of that sound instantly."
2-103-33,"Some went on their horses, some others on their elephants, some in their chariotscovered with ornaments while the youthful people went on foot."
2-103-34,"In their longing to see Rama, whose absence though recent, seemed so long a periodfor them, the whole people ran towards the hermitage."
2-103-35,"Eager to see those brothers re-united there, they went hastily by various means oftransport, either by hoofed animals or by wheeled vehicles."
2-103-36,"Trodden by many vehicles, beasts and chariots, that land emitted a tumultuous noise,as a sky during the conjunction of clouds."
2-103-37,"Frightened by that noise, the wild elephants, surrounded by female elephants,perfuming the quarters with teh scent of their ichor, went to another wood from there."
2-103-38,"Boars, wolves and lions, buffaloes, snakes, monkeys, tigers, Gokarnas and Gavayas(two distinctive species of deer) along with spotted deer felt frightened."
2-103-39,"The ruddy gooses, water-fowls, swans, Karandavas ( a sort of ducks), herons, malecuckoos and cranes, utterly confused made it to various directions."
2-103-40,"The sky filled with birds that had been frightened by that noise and the earthcovered with men, both looked beautiful at that moment."
2-103-41,"Suddenly then, the people beheld the illustrious and the sinless Rama, sitting onthe bare earth."
2-103-42,"Abusing Kaikeyi and Manthara, those people turned up with their faces bathed intears. while approaching Rama."
2-103-43,"Seeing those people thus deeply afflicted their eyes suffused with tears, Ramaknowing what was right, embraced them like their father and mother."
2-103-44,"Rama embraced some men there, while some others offered salutations to him.Approaching them on that occasion, the king's son received them all including his friends andcompanions."
2-103-45,"The tumult of those magnanimous persons lamenting, resounded over the earth and inthe sky, reverberating through the mountain caves and in all quarters like the continuous beatingof drums."
2-104-1,"Eager to see Rama again, Vasishta approached that place, preceded by Dasaratha'swives."
2-104-2,"The king's wives, while moving slowly towards River Mandakini, saw the ford there,being frequented by Rama and Lakshmana."
2-104-3,"With a gloomy and emaciated face, filled with tears, Kausalya spoke to Sumitra andother royal women (as follows):"
2-104-4,"This is the ford, located in the eastern region of the forest, frequented bySeetha, Rama and Lakshmana, banished from the kingdom; those unfortunate persons of illustriousexploits who have no country."
2-104-5,"O, Sumitra! Lakshmana, your son always draws water himself from here unwearyinglyfor the sake of my son."
2-104-6,"Through engaged in an inferior act (of carrying water), your son is not to becensured because all that service rendered to his brother is enjoined with virtues."
2-104-7,"Your son too, who is not accustomed to such pains, will indeed be relived now ofthis mean, wretched and laborious task."
2-104-8,"The large-eyed Kausalya observed a ball made of Ingudi pulp, which was placed byRama in honour of his father on the ground, on aheap of Darbha grass, the raised spikes of whichpointed towards the south."
2-104-9,"Seeing that ball of food placed on the ground by the unfortunate Rama for hisfather, the Queen Kausalya spoke to all those wives of Dasaratha (as follows):"
2-104-10,"See this ball of food offered traditionally by Rama in honour of his father, thehigh-souled Dasaratha the Lord of Ikshvaku race."
2-104-11,"I do not consider this offering as befitting for that great-souled king, who waslike unto a God and who lived amidst every pleasure."
2-104-12,"How can that Lord of the earth, Dasartha, equal to the Lord of celestials and amighty man, having enjoyed the earth with its four quarters, the boundaries of which are theoceans, eat a cake of Ingudi pulp?"
2-104-13,"I do not consider any thing painful to me on earth than when Rama the man offortune offering a cake of Ingudi pulp to his father."
2-104-14,"Seeing this offering, a cake of Ingudi pulp, of Rama to his father, why does myheart not break into a thousand pieces with anguish?"
2-104-15,"It indeed occurs to me that the saying among men that the food eaten by man is alsoconsumed by his Gods is true."
2-104-16,"Consoling Kausalya thus afflicted by grief, Kausalya's companions then proceededfurther and saw Rama in his hermitage, who resembled an Immortal driven out of Paradise."
2-104-17,"Beholding Rama bereft of all enjoyments, his mothers agonized as they were withgrief, emitted cries and allowed tears to flow."
2-104-18,"Rama, the tiger among men, true to his promise raised up and took hold of theauspicious feet of all his mothers."
2-104-19,"Those large-eyed Queens, by means of their pleasantly touching soft fingers andpalms as well as charming hands, wiped the dust from Rama's back."
2-104-20,"Seeing all those mothers, the wailing Lakshmana too slowly paid obeisance devotedlyto them all by bowing to each in turn, immediately after Rama."
2-104-21,"All Dasaratha's wives manifested the same affection towards Lakshmana, who was bornof Dasaratha and exceedingly handsome, as they did to Rama."
2-104-22,"Then, the grief-stricken Seetha, her eyes filed with tears, also touched the feet ofher mothers-in-laws and stood before them."
2-104-23,"Kausalya embraced the miserable Seetha as a mother her daughter, she who wasemaciated because of her stay in the forest and afflicted with grief, and spoke the followingwords:"
2-104-24,"How has the daughter of King Janaka, the daughter-in-law of King Dasaratha andRama's wife, fallen into such a wretched plight that she is living in a desolate forest?"
2-104-25,"O, Seetha! Seeing your face, like a lotus withered with heart or a faded lily orgold defiled with dust or a moon hidden by the clouds, the fire of grief produced by the firewoodof adversity and existing in my mind burns me severely."
2-104-26,"While the sorrowful mother was speaking thus, Rama the elder brother of Bharataapproached Vasishta and took hold of his feet in salutation."
2-104-27,"Then, Rama holding the feet of that priest, who was equal of Agni the fire andendowed with very great splendour, even as Indra the Lord of celestials would clasp the feet ofBrihaspati, sat down by his side."
2-104-28,"Then, after Rama and Vasishta sat, Bharata the pious man along with his counsellors,the leading citizens, warriors and virtuous people seated himself at a lowel level at a proximityto Rama."
2-104-29,"Seeing Rama in the garb of an ascetic, radiant in majesty, the extremely powerfulBharata, paying obeisance to him with joined palms, then took his place in his presence, as thedevoted Indra the Lord of celestials sits before Brahma the Lord of creation."
2-104-30,"A highest curiosity arose in the minds of those worthy men (assembled there) as towhat persuasive words Bharata at that moment would utter, while addressing Rama, having offeredsalutation and homage to him."
2-104-31,"That Rama endowed with truth and forbearance with Lakshmana who was bestowed withmagnanimity and the pious Bharata, surrounded by his companions, were as resplendent as the threesacrificial Fires (known by the names of Garhapatya, Ahavamiya and Dakshina), accompanied by thesuperintending priests."
2-105-1,"While those lions among men amidst a host of friends were lamenting, that nightelapsed with a much difficulty."
2-105-2,"When the beautiful dawn broke, Rama's brothers along with their companions, havingmade their offerings and recited their prayers on the banks of River Madakini, approached Rama."
2-105-3,"Sitting in silence, no one uttered a word. Bharata, on his part, amidst hiscompanions, addressed Rama as follows:"
2-105-4,"My mother has been consoled (by you) by giving this kingdom to me. I am giving backthat kingdom to you. Enjoy it without hindrance!"
2-105-5,"As a dam breached by a great on-rush of water during a rainy season cannot berepaired so easily, this great continent cannot be defended by any one other than you."
2-105-6,"As a donkey cannot emulate the tempo of a horse, or an ordinary bird the movementof Garuda (a kind of falcon), neither can I follow in your footsteps, O, Lord of the world!"
2-105-7,"O, Rama! Know his life to be blessed forever, on whom others depend Life is,however, difficult for him who depends on others for this life."
2-105-8,"As a tree planted by a man may grow and with its great branches and immense trunk,become inaccessible to a dwarf, yet though it may come to flowering, does not bear fruit, it yeildsno pleasure for him. O, mighty armed! You ought to understand the import of theis simile and beingthe distinguished Lord of all, may you guide us, your sevants!"
2-105-9,"O, emperor, the conqueror of foes! May all behold you, shining resplendent on allsides like the sun, seated on the throne!"
2-105-10,"O, Rama! May the elephants, intoxicated with ichor be heard trumpeting on thehighway, when you do return and the women of the inner apartments rejoice, all happily joinedtogether."
2-105-11,"Hearing the words of Bharata, who was thus appealing to Rama, the various people ofthe city in approbation, said ""Excellent! Well said!"""
2-105-12,"On seeing the illustrious and sorrowful Bharata thus lamenting, the prudent andself-conposed Rama began to console him as follows:"
2-105-13,"Man is not able to do what he wills. He is not the Master A fixed form or namedrives him hither and thither."
2-105-14,"All that is piled up, is finally disbursed. What rises, ends in a fall. Unio endsin separation. Life ends in death."
2-105-15,"How a ripe fruit does not fear for anything other than its falling, so also a manonce born, does not fear for anything other than his death."
2-105-16,"As a house that is solidly contructed ultimately falls into decay, human being toois subject to age and death."
2-105-17,"The night that has passed, does not return and the buntiful River Yamuna justmarches on towards the all-sufficient abounding in water."
2-105-18,"The pasing days and nights in this world quickly decrease the life-span of allliving being as in the summer, the rays of the sun dry up the water (in a pool)."
2-105-19,"You grieve for yourself. Why do you grieve for another? Even while you stay athome, or departed to another place, your life-span gets shortened."
2-105-20,"Death walks just with us (as we walk) and sits with us (as we sit). Havingtravelled a very long distance (with us), death returns along with us (as we return)."
2-105-21,"When folds have appeared on limbs and hair have turned grey; on what expedient cana man having got decayed with age, come back to the original splendour?"
2-105-22,"People are deligted when the sun has risen and also when the day ends. But they arenot able to perceive the waning in their life-span."
2-105-23,"Seeing the onset of season, people rejoice, as though it has come something newly.But the succession of the seasons devours the life of being."
2-105-24,"As pieces of drift-wood floating on the ocean coe toghether for a span, so wives,children, kinsmen wealth and property come together for a while and part with us. Their parting indeed inevitable."
2-105-25,"Here, no being can escape its destiny ( in the form of birth and death). For thatreason, the power to avert his own death does not ingrain in a man mourning for a dead person."
2-105-26,"As a caravan is passing on a road, one stationed at the way-side says, I too willcome behind you. In the same manner, we should inevitably follow the path taken by fathers and firefathers. Why a man who obtained that path, for which there is no return, distress himself."
2-105-27,"While the age reshes on, without any return like a flowing river, one's self shouldbe emplyoed in a pursuit leading to blessedness. It is said that beings are meant to be happy?"
2-105-28,"The king Dasaratha, our pious minded father performed almost all auspicioussacrifices and paid plentiful sacrificial fees (to the officitaing preists and Brahmins) and wentto heaven."
2-105-29,"Our father reached heaven because he maintained his servants properly, protectedhis subjects and realised the taxes in the manner prescribed by scriptures from them."
2-105-30,"Our father, the king Dasaratha obtained heaven because of his auspicious acts andperfoming sacrifices involving heavy sacrificial fees."
2-105-31,"Having perfomed many types of sacrifices, enjoying worldly pleasure abundantly andhaving obtained a long and virtuous life, king Dasaratha reached heaven."
2-105-32,"O, dear brother! King Dasaratha, our father who was treated with respect by allvirtuous men and who secured excellent life-span and enjoyments, is not to be pitied."
2-105-33,"King Dasaratha, our father, having abandoned his worn-out human body, indeed hasattained the celstial state, by which he can stroll in the realm of Brahma (the highestheaven)."
2-105-34,"No wise, learned and exceptionally clever man, would weep in such a manner, such asI and you, about the emperor."
2-105-35,"The wise, who are steadfast, should indeed relinquish these sorrows, lamentatious,weepings and such other states of misery."
2-105-36,"Be composed, O Most eloquent of orators! Control your grief, return to the City ofAyodhya in order to obey the command of our father, the subduer of his senses."
2-105-37,"I also will fulfil the command of our father, the venrable man in that very place,whre I have been ordered to stay by that king Dasaratha of virtuous deeds."
2-105-38,"O Bharata the Vanquisher of Foes! It is not justifiable for me to violate thecommand of our father. You also must honour it to the end, for it comes from our father, out ownblood."
2-105-39,"O, Bharata! Hence, I shall conform to the honourable word of our father, thepractiser of virtue, by my act of dwelling in the forest."
2-105-40,"O, Tigher among men! Thus should a pious man act, who seeks to harm none, who isobedient to his elders and who aspires to conquer the higher world."""
2-105-41,"O, excellent among men! perceiving the virutous conduct of our father, the KingDasaratha, act in conformity to your own nature."
2-105-42,"Having uttered in about an hour, these meaningful words in this manner to hisyounger brother on the need of abedience to his father's will, the magnamous and the mighty Ramabecame silent."
2-106-1,"When Rama thus kept silent after uttering those meaningful words as aforesaid, thepious Bharata for his part addressed to virtuous Rama who was fond of people conformable to justiceat the banks of that River Mandakini."
2-106-2,"Who, in this world, is endowed with such qualities like you, O annihilator ofenemies! Neither does sorrow disturb you nor does joy enrapture you. You are highly honoured byelders and you clarify your doubts from them."
2-106-3,"By what should he be moved, who looks on life and death, misfortune or prosperitywith an equal eye?"
2-106-4,"O, King! He who knows the totality of time as you do, ought not to feel despondenteven on meeting with adversity."
2-106-5,"O, the magnanimous Rama! you are equally strong as celestials. You are true to yourpromise, all-knowing, all-viewing and endowed with understanding."
2-106-6,"Even the most fearful calamity ought not to attack you, endowed as you are, withsuch attributes; and recognising the birth and end of all beings."
2-106-7,"The sinful deed, committed by my mean mother for my sake during my absence, was notto my liking. (Hence) be gracious to me."
2-106-8,"I am bound by the chanins of morality. For that reason, I do not kill iwth a severepunishment, my mother who was of perverse conduct and worthy of retribution."
2-106-9,"How can I, born of Dasaratha of noble birth and deeds and conversant of right andwrong, do the most wicked and horrible act?"
2-106-10,"The King Dasaratha was my preceptor, had several sacrificial performances to hiscredit was aged, was my father, equal to a deity and is now dead. Hence, I cannot reproach him inan open assembly."
2-106-11,"O Rama the knower of piety! What man who knows the principles of righteousness,would commit such an improper act, bereft of one's interest and duty, in order just to please awoman?"
2-106-12,"There is an ancient saying that at the time of death, beings lose their judgment.The king, acting as he did, has made this saying indeed true in the eyes of the world."
2-106-13,"This transgression of righteousness was done by our father for fear of anger (ofkaikeyi) or through infatuation and over-haste. You do keep in view a noble purpose and reversethat transgression."
2-106-14,"A son who honours only a good deviation (from righteousness) of a father isaccepted as a real son in this world. He who acts otherwise than this would be facing a quitereverse situation."
2-106-15,"You be that real son. Do not lend yourself to the infamous act, committed by ourfather, which in this world, confident men freely condemn."
2-106-16,"Save Kaikeyi and me, our father, our friends, our relatives, all the urbanites andthe villagers as well as the entire kingdom."
2-106-17,"Where is the forest and where is the princely dignity? Where is the matted hair andwhere is the protection of a kingdom? You ought not to do such a contradictory act."
2-106-18,"O, the highly enlightened hero! The first duty of a warrior is indeed to getcrowned, so that he may then protect his subjects."
2-106-19,"Which man of warrior-caste would set aside his manifest duty and prctise a virtuethat gives doubtful result, which does not promise happiness, which has a mental restraint andwhich is uncertain?"
2-106-20,"If you desire to pursue a virtue alone; although born of pain, then take painswhile protecting the four castes as per tradition, by recourse to righteousness."
2-106-21,"O, Rama the knower of righteousness! The knower of what is right indeed tell thatthe life of a house-holder is the noblest of all the four* stages of life. How can you abandonit?"
2-106-22,"I am indeed junior to you in the point of learning, situation and by birth. Howshould I rule the earth, while still you are living?"
2-106-23,"I, a mere child, who am devoted of intelligence and virtues besides placed in aninferior position, cannot even live without you."
2-106-24,"O, Rama the knower of righteousness! Rule this entire kingdom belonging to yourfather, without distraction, without hindrance and as per the conduct prescribed for you along withyour relatives."
2-106-25,"Let all the king's ministers along with Vasishta and other priests well-versed insacred formulas, crown you, the knower of sacred texts, here itself."
2-106-26,"You, having been crowned thus, may proceed to Ayodhya along with us to rule it,like Indra the Lord of celestials, having conquered all the worlds with his might, proceeds to hiskingdom along with celestials."
2-106-27,"You shall discharge the three obligations subdue all the enemies, gratify thewishes of all your friends and you alone rule me in Ayodhya."
2-106-28,"O, noble brother! May your friends rejoice today at your enthronement. May yourenemies, full of terror, flee today to the ten quarters."
2-106-29,"O, excellent among men! Wipe off my mother's curse today and protect our venerablefather from his sin."
2-106-30,"I request you by bowing my head before you. Show compassion on me and on all ourrelatives as Lord Shiva ( the Supreme Deity) on all beings."
2-106-31,"Else if you disregard my entire request and move again into the forest form here, Itoo will go along with you."
2-106-32,"Even while being propitiated by Bharata as above, by bowing his head duly sinking inhis spirit, the illustrious Rama, the Lord of the earth was still abiding in the words of hisfather and did not feel inclined to return to Ayodhya."
2-106-33,"Seeing that wonderful staunchness in Rama, the people of Ayodhya felt sorrowful andat the same time, experienced joy. They became distressed that he was not going to Ayodhya and feltrejoiced to see his firmness of resolve."
2-106-34,"The priests, citizens and elders of that multitude as well as Queens, distracted andweeping bitterly, acclaimed Bharat who was then speaking thus, duly prostrating himself before Ramaand added theri supplications to Rama."
2-107-1,"Thereafter, the illustrious Rama, highly respected among his fraternity, (asfollows) to Bharata who was speaking as aforesaid among his relatives."
2-107-2,"These words, which you have spoken are worthy of you, the son of Dasaratha theexcellent king, born through Kaikeyi."
2-107-3,"O, My brother! Long ago, when our father married your mother, he promised yourmaternal grandfather that he would confer his kingdom as an exceptional marriage-dowry"
2-107-4,"Thereafter, in a conflict between Gods and demons, your mother received the promiseof two boons from the efficient lord of the earth, King Dasartha, as a token of his joy andgratitude."
2-107-5,"O, Tiger among men! Your illustrious mother of beautiful complexion consequentlydemanded these two boons from that cheif of men, for you the throne and for me the exile to theforest."

2-113-16,"O Bharata the Tiger among men and excellent among those having virtue and goodconduct! There is no surprise that a noble trait prevails in you, as naturally as the water allowedto go, always settles downwards."
2-113-17,"Your valiant father, Dasaratha, is immortal in having such a son as you are, theknower of righteousness and loving peity."
2-113-18,"Hearing the words of that sage, Bharata with his joined palms, touched his feet insalutation and began taking leave from him."
2-113-19,"Then, the glorious Bharata made circumambulation again and again to Bharadwaja andproceeded to Ayodhya along with hims ministers."
2-113-20,"Thata extensive army of Bharata, following him with vehicles, carts and elephants,turned back again towards Ayodhya."
2-113-21,"Thereafter, all of them crossed the charming River Yamuna wreathed with waves andmoreover saw the River Ganga with its pure water."
2-113-22,"Bharata accompanied by his relative and his army crossed that River Ganga, full ofcharming waters and entered the beautiful town of Shringibhera. From Shringibhera, he saw Ayodhyaagain."
2-113-23,"Beholding the City of Ayodhya, which was bereft of his father and brother, Bharatatormented with grief, spoke the following words to the charioteer:"
2-113-24,"O, Charioteer! See that Ayodhya city, ruined, with a vacant look, joyless,miserable, and with an impeded voice."
2-114-1,"The highly illustrious Lord, Bharata riding on a chariot emanating a gentle and deepsound entered soon the city of Ayodhya."
2-114-2,"He entered the city, frequented by cats and owls, abiding with crouched men andelephants and looking like a night enveloped by gloom, indistinctness and darkness."
2-114-3,"Ayodhya looked like the planet Rohini, the beloved consort of the moon-god (treatedas the enemy by the demon Rahu), tormented by planet Rahu* in the ascendant though ordinarilyinvested with an exceedingly bright splendour by virtue of her glory."
2-114-4,"Ayodhya further looked emaciated like a mountain stream, whose scanty waters hadbecome hot and agitated, birds living in which were scorched by the sun, and whose fish, small andbig and alligators had perished."
2-114-5,"Ayodhya looked like a flame of sacrificial fire which when oblation is poured intoit, rises like a golden cone without smoke and thereafter sinks into extinction (ash)."
2-114-6,"Ayodhya looked like an afflicted army, shattered of its armour in a major conflict,whose ensigns borne on horses, elephants and chariots had been torn, and its heroic warriorsslain."
2-114-7,"Ayodhya appeared like the waves of the sea though tosses very high with foam and aroar, is rendered noiseless, being shaken up by a silent wind."
2-114-8,"Ayodhya appeared like a sacred altar, which, when the period of offering oblationsinto fire has completely expired, has been cleared of all sacrificial implements and deserted ofrecitations by the learned priests."
2-114-9,"Ayodhya appeared like restless kine, deprived of the bull, who cease to graze in newpastures and stand in the cow-pen, dispirited."
2-114-10,"Ayodhya was resembling a new pearl-necklace, bereft of well- polished dazzling andexcellent gems, rubies and the like, of genuine quality."
2-114-11,"Ayodhya appeared like a meteor, which moved from its position with its virtueexhausted, soon dropped from the sky and fallen to earth, deprived of its splendour."
2-114-12,"Ayodhya appeared like a flowering creeper laden with blossom in the spring-tide,frequented by a swarm of intoxicated bees, that is suddenly consumed by a forest fire andwithering."
2-114-13,"With its senseless traffic paralyzed and with its fairs and markets closed, Ayodhyaresembled like a firmament, covered with clouds, with the moon and stars obscured."
2-114-14,"Ayodhya appeared splendourless, like a deserted and uncleaned tavern, with itsvendor of spirituous liquors killed, the excellent wine expended, its drinking pots and glassesbroken and the pieces stewn in disorder."
2-114-15,"Ayodhya resembled a cistern erected for storage and distribution of water, but nowbroken and collapsed with its platform riven and sunk, and covered with broken jars and earthenvessels, its water having been used up."
2-114-16,"Ayodhya resembled a bow-string, which was large and bent, with suitable noose atboth ends, but severed from the bow by the arrows of heroes and fallen to the ground."
2-114-17,"Ayodhya appeared like a mare, urged on suddenly by a horse-man, skilled in war-fareand fallen down when killed by the opposite army."
2-114-18,"Sitting in the chariot, the glorious Bharata, the son of Dasaratha, spoke thefollowing words to the charioteer who was riding his excellent chariot:"
2-114-19,"How is it that the deep and intensified sound of vocal and instrumental music isnot heard as before in Ayodhya today?"
2-114-20,"The intoxicating odour of spirituous liquor or the fragrance of floral garlands orthe aroma of sandal and aloe-wood fumes, which used to be spread once on all sides, are not beingwafted."
2-114-21,"O, Sumantra! I do not hear, as before, the sound of the horses, the sound of theintoxicating elephants and the clattering of the great chariots in this city now."
2-114-22,"Rama, having left Ayodhya, the distressful youth are not making use of the perfumeslike sandal-wood, aloe wood as also the most admirable and fresh floral garlands."
2-114-23,"In the city afflicted by Rama's desertion, people are not going out forpleasure-trips, wearing colourful garlands nor festivals are observed by them."
2-114-24,"The lustre of Ayodhya has departed along with my brother. It is certain. ThisAyodhya is not shining indeed, like a rainy night at the time of the waning moon."
2-114-25,"When will my brother return, like a carnival, diffusing joy in Ayodhya, as do theautumnal rains?"
2-114-26,"The highways in Ayodhya are not glittering with youthful people, richly attired,bearing themselves bravely and roaming about in groups."
2-114-27,"Thus speaking in many ways, Bharata entered his father's house, bereft of thatemperor and which resembled a cave bereft of a lion."
2-114-28,"Bharata, though a composed man himself, shed tears by seeing that entire emptygynaecium, looking like a day without the sun with its relinquished radiance."
2-115-1,"Having brought his mothers back to Ayodhya; Bharata, fixed in his resolve but sorestricken with grief, spoke to Vasishta and the elders (as follows)"
2-115-2,"I am going to Nandigrama village. I take leave of all of you. There, I shall beable to endure all this woe, occasioned by Rama's absence."
2-115-3,"The king Dasaratha went to heaven. My elder brother is in the forest. I shall awaitfor Rama to return to the kingdom; since verily he alone is the celebrated Lord of Ayodhya."
2-115-4,"Hearing those auspicious words of the magnanimous Bharata, Vasishta the preceptorand all the ministers spoke as follows:"
2-115-5,"O, Bharata! The words which your have spoken by you in devotion to your brother arevery much appreciable. It is worthy of you alone."
2-115-6,"What man would not approve of the proposal of your highness, who are deeplyfascinated of your relative, always affectionate to your brother and devoted to the path ofelders?"
2-115-7,"Hearing the affectionate words of his counsellors, who spoke according to his wish,Bharata said to his charioteer, ""Let my chariot be made ready!"""
2-115-8,"The illustrious Bharata, looking pleased and having offered salutation to all hismothers, entered his chariot along with Shatrughna."
2-115-9,"Both Shatrughna and Bharata, having quickly mounted the chariot and exceedinglyrejoiced, set out, accompanied by ministers and family-priests."
2-115-10,"All the preceptors there, headed by Vasishta and other brahmanas being in theforefront, proceeded eastward, in which direction Nandigrama village was situated."
2-115-11,"When Bharata had left, the army too, abounding in elephants, horses and chariotsmarched unbidden. The residents of the city also followed suit."
2-115-12,"The magnanimous Bharata, affectionate of his brother, bearing the sandals belong toRama on his head, set out for Nandigrama."
2-115-13,"Thereafter, having entered Nandigrama briskly Bharata descended his chariot quicklyand spoke to his preceptors as follows:"
2-115-14,"My brother, Rama has given to me this kingdom as a trust. These sandals,embellished with gold diffuse gain and security to the people."
2-115-15,"Having dedicated the sacred trust to the wooden sandals, Bharata sore-stricken withanguish, spoke to the entire body of his ministers as follows:"
2-115-16,"Hold the state canopy speedily over these wooden sandals, which have been acceptedas symbols of the feet of Rama, my noble brother. By the presence of these wooden sandals of mybrother here, a piety has been established in the kingdom."
2-115-17,"As a mark of compassion, this trust has been placed at my disposal, by my brother.There trust as such will be preserved till his return."
2-115-18,"Having restored these wooden sandals personally to Rama's feet immediately afterhis return, I shall behold those feet of Rama along with these sandals."
2-115-19,"Restoring the kingdom to my elder brother, when re-united with him and therebylaying down the burden, I shall then assume the role of a servant of my elder brother."
2-115-20,"By giving away these excellent wooden sandals, the symbols of trust, this kingdom,as well as the City of Ayodhya to Rama, I shall be washed of all my sins."
2-115-21,"Rama will be installed and his subjects made happy. It will be a four-fold morefame and happiness for me than that having obtained from the kingdom."
2-115-22,"The highly illustrious Bharata though a distressed man, thus lamenting and pained,looked after the state administration along with his ministers from Nandigrama."
2-115-23,"Assuming bark robes and matted locks in the guise of an ascetic, the lord and thehero Bharata dwelt in Nandigrama, protected by the army."
2-115-24,"Bharata, obedient to his elder brother, affectionate of his brothers and faithful tohis vow, thus resided in Nandigrama, coronating the wooden sandals on the throne and wishing alwaysfor the return of Rama."
2-115-25,"Reporting all the royal orders to the wooden sandals, Bharata was holding the royalcanopy together with the chowrie to those sandals."
2-115-26,"Coronating the wooden sandals of his elder brother, the illustrious Bharatathereafter carried out the state administration, always maintaining his subservience to them."
2-115-27,"Whatever a small affair of the state came up or whenever a high-valued gift wasoffered, Bharata used to report that matter to the wooden sandals and then only dealt with it inthe proper way afterwards."
2-116-1,"Bharata having returned (to Ayodhya), Rama who was dwelling in the woods, observedanxiety accompanied by perturbation among the sages."
2-116-2,"He saw there those ascetics-who were formerly quite pleased in that hermitage atChitrakuta depending as they did on Rama- anxious."
2-116-3,"Pointing out to Rama through the movements of their eyes and eye-brows manifestingtheir anxiety, they whispered among themselves, narrating some legends in secret."
2-116-4,"Perceiving their distress, Rama was filled with apprehension about himself and withjoined palms spoke the following words to a sage, the leader of that community of ascetics:"
2-116-5,"O venerable sage! I fear that the conduct of my forefathers is not seen in me orthere is some change for the worse in me, due to which the ascetics feel agitated."
2-116-6,"Has my younger brother, the high-souled Lakshmana, through inadvertence, behavedunworthy of him while the sages were seeing?"
2-116-7,"I hope that Seetha, who is serving you and who is keen in serving me, does not, Iam afraid, behaved properly, according to the conduct suitable for women."
2-116-8,"Then, that grown-up sage, who was elderly both by age and penance, appearedtrembling and spoke to Rama, who was ever compassionate to all beings, as follows:"
2-116-9,"O, dear Rama! What is there for us the ascetics to fear above all from Seetha, whois natural in her disposition and is the follower of virtue?"
2-116-10,"It is on account of demons, who, through enmity to you, have begun to oppress thesages. Alarmed by it, they discuss with each other how they can best defend themselves."
2-116-11,"O, darling! Here, a demon called Khara, Ravana's younger brother- who is a boaster,victorious in battle, cruel and eater of human flesh, haughty and sinful-having uprooted all theascetics who dwell in Janasthana, is unable to endure you also."
2-116-12,"My darling! From which time you came to dwell in this hermitage, from that timeinwards, the demons continue to ill-treat the ascetics."
2-116-13,"They appear in grotesque and harmful forms, filling them with terror, in diverseforms and possessing ugly and unnatural demeanor."
2-116-14,"Flinging filthy and inauspicious objects on some of the ascetics, the wicked demonsstand in front of them and kill some ascetics too."
2-116-15,"Having themselves in those hermitages unnoticed, those evil-minded demons delightthemselves in destroying the ascetics there."
2-116-16,"At the time of pouring oblations into the sacred fire, they scatter the sacrificialvessels, sprinkle the fires with water and break the water-pots."
2-116-17,"Resolved to leave these retreats that have been invaded by evil spirits, theascetics today are urging me to go to another area."
2-116-18,"O, Rama! Before those wicked beings indeed show bodily injury to the ascetics, weare abandoning this hermitage."
2-116-19,"Not far from here, there is a colourful grove yielding many roots and fruits. Iwill take shelter again in that previous hermitage itself, along with an assembly of sages."
2-116-20,"O, darling! Khara, the demon will behave unjustly with you in the same way. If yourmind feels so inclined, come along with us from here."
2-116-21,"O, Rama! To you, who live with your wife, though you are competent and everwatchful, there is a danger. Your stay here is conduced with misery now."
2-116-22,"Rama the prince could not with his responsive words desist the said sage when he hadspoken as aforesaid, eager as he was to leave the place."
2-116-23,"Having greeted, bidding farewell and justifying his statement to Rama, that leaderof the community departed, leaving the hermitage, along with a host of sages."
2-116-24,"Accompanying them for a distance from that place, bidding farewell to that group ofsages, offering his salutation to that ascetic, the leader of the community and taking leave ofthem, who were well-pleased and having received their counsel, Rama returned to his dwelling, whichwas sacred to reside."
2-116-25,"That Rama, the lord, did not leave even for a moment that hermitage that had beendeserted by the sages. But some ascetics among them who had fixed their mind on Rama (who followedthe conduct of the sages) constantly followed Rama."
2-117-1,"Thereafter, when the sages departed, Rama, reflecting again and again, found nopleasure to remain in that place for many reasons."
2-117-2,"It is here that Bharata, my mother along with the inhabitants of the city visitedme. That memory haunts me, who lament for them daily."
2-117-3,"The dry dung of horses and elephants of that high souled Bharata's encamped armycaused much spoliation (around here)."
2-117-4,"We shall, therefore, move elsewhere, pondering thus, Rama along with Seetha andLakshmana left that place."
2-117-5,"On the way, after reaching the hermitage of a sage called Atri, the highlycelebrated Rama offered salutation to that sage. The venerable sage, Atri too received him as hisown son."
2-117-6,"Offering personally, abundant hospitality with full honours to Rama, the sage Atrirendered equal honour to Lakshmana and the highly blessed Seetha too."
2-117-7,"Atri, who knew righteousness and who was interested in the welfare of all beings,called his aged wife Anasuya who had just come there, she who was revered by all and addressedgently to her."
2-117-8,"Atri excellent sage spoke to the illustrious Anasuya, rich in asceticism and wholived a pious life, saying ""You welcome Videha's daughter!"" and thereafter introduced that virtuousfemale ascetic to Rama (as follows):"
2-117-9,"O, Irreproachable Rama! When the earth was burnt up by drought without break forten years, this virtuous woman produced fruit and roots, caused the River Jahnavi to flow here,undergoing a rigid mortification enriched by pious observances, by whom the most severe asceticismwas practised for ten thousand years and obstacles were done away with and by whom for the reasonof a divine command, in a great hurry ten nights were reduced to one night.* This Anasuya, who hasbathed after completion of the voes, is like a mother to you."
2-117-10,"Let Seetha find refuge with that ascetic, who is revered by all the beings, famousas she is and though old is ever free from anger."
2-117-11,"Saying ""Be it so"" to the aforesaid sage, who was speaking thus, Rama spoke to thevirtuous Seetha, the following excellent words:"
2-117-12,"O, princess! You have heard what the sage has said. For your own good, approach thesaintly Anasuya without delay."
2-117-13,"Hearing these words of Rama, who is desirous of her welfare, Seetha the daughter ofMithila circumambulated around Anasuya, Atri's wife, who knows piety."
2-117-14,"Seetha coolly and reverently paid homage to that fortunate Anasuya, a devoted andvirtuous wife, who was feeble, wrinkled, aged, with her hair turned grey due to old age, and whoseframe constantly shook like a banana tree in a storm. Seetha introduced herself, by announcing hername to Anasuya."
2-117-15,"Saluting the irreproachable ascetic the rejoiced Seetha with joined palms enquiredabout he well-being."
2-117-16,"Then, comforting that celebrated Seetha, engaged in righteous acts, Anasuyarejoicingly spoke as follows: ""Luckily enough, you are attending to righteousness."""
2-117-17,"O, Seetha the beautiful lady! Thank heaven! Leaving your relatives, honour andprosperity, you are accompanying Rama, who is expelled into a forest."
2-117-18,"Highly fortunate worlds await those women, await those women, to whom their husbandis dear no matter whether he lives in a city or in a forest; whether he is sinful or virtuous."
2-117-19,"To women of noble nature, the husband is the highest deity no mater whether he isill-behaved or licentious or devoid of riches."
2-117-20,"O, Seetha! On a reflection, I perceive none who is a better friend than a husband,who protects his wife in all circumstances, like the imperishable fruit of one's austerities."
2-117-21,"Those evil women, whose hearts follow their passions and conduct themselvesdominating their husband, having no understanding of virtue and vice, do not follow him in theaforesaid manner."
2-117-22,"O, Seetha! Surely, those evil women, who get into an improper act of authority overtheir husbands reap infamy and decline in righteousness."
2-117-23,"Women, like you, on the other hand who are endowed with virtues, who look withdetachment on prosperity and adversity in this world, therefore dwell in heaven as those whoperformed meritorious deeds."
2-117-24,"Thus devoted to your lord, loyal to your husband, following established rules, youbecome an honest wife to your husband and obtain merit and renown."
2-118-1,"Anasuya having spoken thus, Seetha without any jealousy, full of reverence for her,addressed her gently as follows:"
2-118-2,"It is not a surprise that a venerable woman like a you, talk to me like this, for,I know well that a husband is a respectable person for a woman."
2-118-3,"O, venerable woman! Even if my husband be without fortune, he should unhesitatinglybe obeyed by me."
2-118-4,"How much more, if he be renowned for his virtues, compassionate, master of myheart, who is ever affectionate, a religious person, manifests the tenderness of a mother and afather to me."
2-118-5,"The exceedingly strong Rama bears himself to all other Queens, as he exercises hisbehaviour towards his mother, Kausalya."""
2-118-6,"The valiant and pious Rama who is devoted to Dasartha and free from all sense ofimportance treats all those women as his mothers on whom Dasaratha has even once bestowed a singleglance."
2-118-7,"While departing for the lonely and fearful forest, my mother-in-law imparted agreat message to me, which I have inscribed in my heart."
2-118-8,"What my mother taught me when witnessed by the fire, earlier at the time of mymarriage with Rama, I shall always remember them."
2-118-9,"O, virtuous woman! By your words, all that is being renewed. No austerity, otherthan obedience to one's husband is decreed for a woman."
2-118-10,"Savitri* is now highly honoured in heaven, for having served her lord faithfullyheaven, You too, having followed this, will proceed to heaven, in showing obedience to yourhusband."""
2-118-11,"This goddess Rohini, the excellent among all women, is not seen without the mooneven for a single moment in the sky."
2-118-12,"Such excellent women, devoted to their husbands, and by their meritorious deeds,are highly honoured in heaven."
2-118-13,"Hearing the words of Seetha, Anasuya was very much pleased, kissed on Seetha'sforehead and spoke delightfully (as follows)"
2-118-14,"O, Seetha with a bright smile! There is a great merit acquired by me in virtue ofmy various pious observances. Through that power, I wish to confer a boon on you."
2-118-15,"O, Seetha! Your words are suitable for the occasion and are charming too. I amsatisfied. Tell me what good I may do for you."
2-118-16,"Hearing those words of Anasuya, Seetha was surprised and with a gentle smile spoketo her, who was richly endowed with the power of askesis, saying; ""Everything stands fulfilled (byyour grace)."
2-118-17,"Thus spoken by Seetha, the pious-minded Anasuya became more delighted and said: ""O,Seetha! Alas! I will create a great joy for you, which will be to your advantage."""
2-118-18,"O, Seetha, the daughter of Videha kingdom! Here are divine gifts: a garland, anapparel, jewels, a scented cosmetic and rare body-cream. These are all given by me to adorn yourlimbs. They will be ever worthy of your and will remain in tact (even after constant use)."
2-118-19,"O, Seetha! Your body, anointed with these heavenly cosmetics, will cause yourhusband to look beautiful, as Lakshmi (the goddess of fortune and beauty) does the imperishableVishnu (the Lord of Preservation)."
2-118-20,"Seetha accepted the apparel, the scented cosmetic, the jewels and the garlands asunsurpassed gifts of love."
2-118-21,"Having accepted those gifts of love, the illustrious Seetha with joined palms, satnear that female ascetic."
2-118-22,"To inquire about a lovely tale of once upon a time, Anasuya who was firm inausterity, started asking the following words to Seetha who was sitting near her in thatmanner."
2-118-23,"O, Seetha! It is so said that you were won by the illustrious Rama through aprocess of your self-choosing (svayamvara)*. This report has reached my ear."
2-118-24,"O, Seetha! I wish to hear that narrative in detail. Hence, tell me that tale infull as you experienced it."
2-118-25,"Then, Seetha obediently answered, saying ""Hear me"" and began to truly narrate thattale of Svayamvara to the virtuous woman, Anasuya."""
2-118-26,"A king of Mithila kingdom, named Janaka who was valiant and a knower ofrighteousness, was devoted to the duty of his warrior class and was ruling the earth in a fittingmanner."
2-118-27,"While he was furrowing a territory of land, holding a plough in his hand, it is sosaid that I came forth, splitting up the land, as a daughter of that king."
2-118-28,"The king Janaka, who was absorbed in scattering handfuls of seeds was surprised tosee me, with all my limbs covered with dust."
2-118-29,"Placing me personally in his lap with affection, that childless king Janaka calledone as his daughter, and was very fond of me since then."
2-118-30,"It is said that voice resembling that of a human being in the air above me rangout, saying: ""O, King! Let it be so. This divine child without a match is a daughter to you,rightly."""
2-118-31,"Thereafter, my father the pious mind the lord of men and the king of Mithilakingdom was rejoiced in my possession and acquired extensive property."
2-118-32,"That king performing auspicious acts gave me into the care of the chief Queen. Shenourished me fondly and with maternal affection."
2-118-33,"Seeing my age to be such, when union with a husband can be easily had, my fatherfell a prey to anxiety like an indigent man, feeling miserable by the loss of all hispossessions."
2-118-34,"Eventhough the father of an unmarried girl be like Indra himself on earth, suffersindignity in the world from the suitor's men, no matter whether they are equal or inferior tohim."
2-118-35,"Perceiving that ill-treatment threatening him at no distant date, the king Janakawas plunged into an ocean of anxiety and did not reach its end any more than a man without a barkwould reach the end of a sea."
2-118-36,"Knowing me to be the one not emerged from a mother's womb, the king after a deepreflection, was unable to find a suitable and worthy husband for me."
2-118-37,"After reflecting thus deeply, the thought came to him, 'I shall inaugurate aSvayamvara, a process of self-choosing marriage, for my daughter."
2-118-38,"In ancient days, Janaka received with affection from Varuna the rain-god, anexcellent bow with two quivers that should never lack arrows."
2-118-39,"That bow was so heavy in weight that no man could lift it up nor any of the kingswere bale to bend it even in their dreams."
2-118-40,"My truthful father called all the princes first and informed them in a meetingabout the bow to be lifted."
2-118-41,"Whoever is able to lift up and string this bow, I will bestow my daughter inmarriage on him. There is no doubt about it."
2-118-42,"Seeing that excellent bow, resembling a mountain in weight, and being unable tolift it up, the princes offered salutation to it and went away."
2-118-43,"After a very long time, this Rama born in Raghu dynasty with a great splendourpossessing a true valour, along with his brother Lakshmana together with a sage Visvamitra, came towitness a sacrifice."
2-118-44,"The pious-souled Visvamitra, having been received well by my father said to myfather, (as follows):"
2-118-45,"These two boys, the sons of Dasaratha wish to see that bow. Show that bow, comingfrom gods, to Rama the prince."
2-118-46,"Hearing the words of Vivamitra, Janaka caused the bow to be brought there. Themighty and the valiant Rama bent that bow merely within an instant and immediately stringed the bowwith the bow-cord and drew the bow to the full."
2-118-47,"While Rama was drawing the bow to the full, the bow was broken into two in themiddle due to the resultant jerk. The terrific sound then created was like that of a fallingthunderbolt."
2-118-48,"Then and there, my father true to his promise decided to bestow me on Rama,offering him a jar of pure water."
2-118-49,"But Rama did not consent to accept my hand till the will of his father, the Lordand the king of Ayodhya had been made known to him."
2-118-50,"Thereupon, my father-in-law and the aged Dasaratha was invited to Mithila by myfather and with his approval, I was bestowed on Rama, the knower of the self."""
2-118-51,"My younger sister Urmila, the virtuous lady of lovely looks was given as a consortto Lakshmana by my father himself."
2-118-52,"I was given thus to Rama in that Svayamvara, a process of self-choosing marriage. Ibecame devoted, by my good works, to my husband who is excellent among men of strength."
2-119-1,"Hearing that great story, Anasuya the knower of piety kissed Seetha's forehead andhugged her in her arms."
2-119-2,"It was narrated sweetly and amazingly by you, in clear words and syllables. It hasbeen indeed heard by me how all that Svayamvara, the process of self-choosing marriage took place.O, the sweet speaking Seetha! I am overjoyed by hearing your story."
2-119-3,"O, Fortunate One! While the auspicious night drawing near, the sun has sunk belowhorizon. The twittering of the birds can be heard, who, through the day, have sought theirnourishment far and wide and are seeking their shelter for sleep at the time ofevening-twilight."
2-119-4,"These ascetics too are returning together, their bark-robes drenched from bathing,and with uplifted vessels, wet with sprinkled water on them."
2-119-5,"From the sacred fire kindled by the sages, according to the scriptural ordinance, acolumn of smoke with the hue of a Pigeon's neck, raised by the wind, is seen there."
2-119-6,"Thought their foliage is sparse, the trees look dense all around. The quarters ofthe world, by whom the senses are drawn apart, do not shine brilliantly at this place."
2-119-7,"The animals who wander about at night are ranging everywhere. The deer of thehermitage are sleeping round the sacred altars."
2-119-8,"O, Seetha! The night richly adorned with stars has set well in motion. The moonencircled with light is seen rising in the sky."
2-119-9,"Go now. I give you leave. Be a female companion to Rama. Your sweet conversationhas charmed me."
2-119-10,"O, Seetha! O, Dear child! Adorn (with ornaments and apparel gifted by me_ before myeyes and cause delight to me in embellishing yourself with heavenly jewels."
2-119-11,"Then Seetha, adorning herself, resembled the daughter of a god, and making obeisanceto the feet of Anasuya, she went forward to meet Rama."
2-119-12,"Rama, the most eloquent one, saw Seetha adorned as aforesaid and felt delighted overthe charming gifts of the ascetic."
2-119-13,"Seetha, the daughter of Mithila kingdom then showed to Rama all the apparel, jewelsand garlands the affectionate gifts of Anasuya the hermitess."
2-119-14,"Seeing the respectful treatment, received by Seetha, which was very rare among humanbeings, Rama and Lakshmana the great car-warrior felt highly rejoiced."
2-119-15,"Thereupon, Rama with his face resembling the moon, having been honoured by the holyascetics, was delighted and spent that auspicious night there."
2-119-16,"While that night passed away, Rama and Lakshmana the tigers among men finished theirablutions and took leave of the ascetics dwelling the forest, who had just poured oblations intothe sacred fire."
2-119-17,"Those ascetics dwelling in the forest and practising virtue told Rama and Lakshmanaabout the region of that forest, which was infested with demons (as follows):"
2-119-18,"O, Rama! Various forms of man-eating demons and beasts drinking the blood areliving in this great forest."
2-119-19,"O, Rama! They devour an ascetic or a celibate, who has not rinsed his mouth afterfinishing his meal or who is inattentive in this great forest. (Pray ward them off!"
2-119-20,"O, Rama! Here is the path of the great sages, through which they fetch the fruitsin this forest. It is appropriate for you to go by this path in this dangerous forest."
2-119-21,"Thus addressed by those Brahmanas having great asceticism, who, with joined palmspaid obedience to him and blessed his journey, Rama the harasser of his foes entered the forestwith his consort along with Lakshmana, as sun enters a mass of clouds."
3-1-1,"Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana enter the great forest called Dandaka Forest and adore the eminent sages, who are in penance and hermitages in that forest. This canto is named as Aranya Kanda not just to show that Rama roved over just forests. The forests, as per Indian tradition, are the treasure houses of knowledge, and they are the ultimate in Vedic culture."
3-1-2,"Thus, until Ayodhya Kanda Rama&#39;s exile is in <font color=""#B3003A"">aaryavarta</font> , the place of noblemen, from River Ganges to Greece. Now Rama is stepping into an area called <font color=""#B3003A"">janasthana</font>,meaning people&#39;s place. This janasthana is the place where Rama eradicated certain negative aspects of the then anarchic individualised dominions where jungle law was the only recourse and brought all of them under one roof. Though people lived there about along with sages and demons as well, demonic influence is said to be predominant, as per Ramayana or other Purana-s. These demons are narrated to be man-eaters, but not cannibals who eat their own tribesmen.Recent discoveries revealed that the first humans were cannibals."
3-1-3,"The Science magazine reported about the excavations at Neanderthals Neander Valley, Germany. In the words of Alban Defleur of the Universite de la Mediterranee at Masrseilles, France, The finding allows us for the first time to demonstrate the existence of the practice of cannibalism by European eanderthals. It is not clear from the excavations of Neanderthals, whether the cannibalism was practised for survival or as a ritual.And even at Alveston in the western English country of Gloucestershire, recently found are such human thighbones, which had been split down the middle to remove marrow. Archaeologists of Bristol University are saying that the evidence indicated the victims could have been disabled and deformed people in society. They have been murdered and eaten, and the radiocarbon dating suggests these finds are about 2000 years ago. This practice is attributed to some underworld cults during the later Iron Age. That being the situation in Europe, in the knowable history, in Ramayana that has happened in an unknown era, the rakshasa-s are narrated to be man-eaters, but not as cannibals.But the accounts given in Aranya Kanda and elsewhere, in ancient India the rakshasa-s ate up humans neither for their own survival nor for ritual but to exhibit their tyranny and their barbaric supremacy. They never reported to have eaten their own clansmen, but have a palate for other breed. Hence it is not exactly cannibalism, but a barbaric act to exert savage scare. This is what the sages advise Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana when departing towards Dandaka Aranya, and indirectly suggest eradicating such a savage atmosphere in peaceful forests."
3-1-4,"When it comes to <font color=""#B3003A"">isms</font> , it is said that the whole clash is between<font color=""#B3003A"">Vaishnavaites</font> and <font color=""#B3003A"">Shaivites</font> or<font color=""#B3003A"">Shaaktaites</font> , because the raakshasa-s are invariably Shiva worshippers, where Vaishnavism is a later development. All the raakshasa-s or demons [in fact the term &#39;demon&#39; do not suit them,] portrayed hereafter, are ardent worshippers of Shiva, and have every blessing from Shiva or Brahma. It is an ethnicity of its own which lived rich lives, pompous in attributes, wielded magical powers, and unabatedly performed anything that is beneficial for them.Their riches and glory will be reflected in Sundara Kanda, which will be burnt down by Hanuma, humbling this deleterious ethnicity, even before Rama&#39;s war with Ravana. Such an ethnic culture will be portrayed hereafter, in constant conflict with Rama, and Rama eradicating each and every member of such ethnicity that goes against any civility."
3-1-5,"Rama does much good in jansthana in wiping out those cultures of greedily dictatorial, magically overpowering, and ruinous to other forms of civility. In fact this Aranya Kanda is not explained in vivid terms by the ancient commentators, and if things are probed deeper in this book, Aranya Kanda, Rama did more social work than miracles.Hence much can be explored into this Aranya Kaanda, the Book of Forest, in terms of sociological, demographically and ethnological pursuits of Rama to establish one great orderly civil empire under one emperor, that is what we call Rama Raajya. Further, it will be narrated that Rama killed these Rakshasas in thousands, which is objected by materialists as how can an archer eliminate so many thousands of Rakshasas, with just a bow and arrows.It may be remembered that Sage Viswamitra accords many kinds of missiles to Rama, after the killing of Tataka, the demoness, in Bala Kanda.It may not be surprising for this generation to know that a single trigger can create havoc of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and then in all its probability Rama also might have triggered in the same way, with the missiles endowed by Sage Viswamitra."
3-1-6,"On entering the impenetrable Dandaka forest that courageous and unassailable Rama saw a clusters of hermitages of sages. [3-1-1]"
3-1-7,"Overspread with Darbha, the sacred grass, and jute clothing, well pervaded with Vedic splendour and well glowing like the un-seeable solar arena in the sky, with naked eye. [3-1-2]"
3-1-8,"On looking at the rising red sun, the devotee is asking Oh! Pooshan! God Sun, nourisher of the universe, the trueness of the Supreme is covered by your golden disk like vessel, [i.e., your Solar disk,] slide it aside, for as a truthful and righteous devotee, I visualize [that which is beyond your golden Solar disc.]"
3-1-9,"Those hermitages have well-tidied thresholds on all sides, dense with many deer and teemed with many groups of birds, and they are the recourse for all living beings. [3-1-3]"
3-1-10,"Those hermitages are always adored by groups of apsarasa-s with their continued dancing, their Holy Fireplaces are very broad, and are with oblation items, vessels, deerskins and sacred grass, and they are beaming forth with gigantic trees that yield sacred and palatable fruits, and with ritual fuels, and water vessels, tubers and fruits. [3-1-4, 5]"
3-1-11,"Those hermitages are sacrosanct for Ritual fire is being worshiped with fire-oblations and sacrifices to the reverberating Vedic sounds, and they are enwrapped with lotus ponds with lotuses, and even with flowers of forest. [3-1-6]"
3-1-12,"They have age-old saints with controlled senses who are clad in jute cloths and deerskin, and who subsist on fruits and tubers alone, ye their resplendence is like that that of the Sun-god or the Fire-god. [3-1-7]"
3-1-13,"Rama has seen such a cluster of hermitages that is glistening forth just by the presence of holy saints whose sustenance is constrained, and that hermitage is distinctive like Brahma&#39;s abode, reverberating with the sounds of that Brahma&#39;s Vedic chants alone. [3-1-8]"
3-1-14,"That glorious and great resplendent Rama on seeing those precincts of hermitage that is graced with highly blest Brahmans, the knowers of Brahma, neared it, unstringing the bowstring of his great bow. [3-1-9-10a]"
3-1-15,"Those great sages, the possessors of divine knowledge, are gladdened on seeing Rama and illustrious Seetha, and they moved towards them welcomingly. [3-1-10-11a]"
3-1-16,"But those sages who are austerely committed to vows, on their seeing Rama, the treader on the path of rectitude, and who is now arising like moon, and at Lakshmana and at glorious Seetha as well, rendered Vedic blessings and welcomed the trio. [3-1-11a-12]"
3-1-17,"Those forest-dwelling sages saw the physical built, its augustness and gracefulness, and his fine attire remaining in astonished postures. [3-1-13]"
3-1-18,"The forest-dwellers saw Seetha, Lakshmana and Rama, without a wink on their own eyes, as that trio is causing surprise with their arrival."
3-1-19,"The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes [like celestial beings, who do not have the winking property on their eyes like living beings,] as their arrival is causing surprise."
3-1-20,"The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes [as though the Vishnu along with Goddess Lakshmi and Thousand headed-serpent, <font color=""#B3003A"">aadi sheSha</font> are coming from their abode<font color=""#B3003A"">vaikunTha</font> to this hermitage, for this hermitage is like Brahma&#39;s abode, as already said, thus the sages lost their wink. And loosing any single wink will loose the sight of these divinities from<font color=""#B3003A"">vaikunTha</font>; hence their unannounced arrival caused surprise in them, which further caused a wink-less state [3-1-14]"
3-1-21,"Those august sages that are interested in the well being of all beings have indeed accommodated Rama in that hermitage, as Rama is their guest a priori. [3-1-15]"
3-1-22,"Then those august sages who are similar to sacred fire in glow have procedurally accorded guestship to Rama, and fetched water for him. [3-1-17]"
3-1-23,"On sounding out Vedic blessings those virtuous sages have offered flowers, fruits and tubers, and even the entire hermitage to that great soul Rama, and then with their palms adjoined. [3-1-17-18a]"
3-1-24,"The king will have great renown for he is the ruler of the righteousness of these people, a protector, a respectable and adorable one, and as he wields the sceptre of justice, he is a revered one too... [3-1-18-19a]"
3-1-25,"The fourth part of Indra is the protector of people, called the king, and hence Oh! Raghava, the king is hailed, and hence he enjoys best and delightful fortune... [3-1-19b-20a]"
3-1-26,"You alone have to protect us as we are the subjects living in your kingdom..May you be in the capital... or in the forest...you are our king... [3-1-20b,c]"
3-1-27,"We gave-up punishments, either physically or by the power of curses, conquered are our anger and senses, and our ascesis is the only wealth of ours, thus oh! King, we are to be protected by you, like the foetus inside a womb... [3-1-21]"
3-1-28,"Thus saying they worshipped Raghava along with Lakshmana, on giving fruits, tubers, flowers and other varieties of forest foods. [3-1-22]"
3-1-29,"Thus other saints and sages who are the followers of the virtue, and similar to the Sacred Fire adored Rama, the king, according to the wont of custom. [3-1-23]"
3-2-1," Then, on receiving the hospitality in that hermitage for that day, and on the next  day before sunrise, Rama bade farewell to all of the sages, and thus entered the deep forests.  [3-2-1]"
3-2-2," Rama followed by Lakshmana has indeed seen that midst of the forest which is  filled with very many animal herds, where the bears and tigers are frequenting, and whose trees,  creepers, bushes are ruined, water ponds rendered unsightly, birds song-less, but where the  swarms of crickets are whistling deafeningly. [3-3-2, 3]"
3-2-3," Therein Rama has seen along with Seetha, a lurid voiced man-eater who is akin to a  mountain-peak, among horrendous animals. [3-2-4]"
3-2-4," Deep eyed, huge mouthed, horrible with a monstrous belly, hideously misshapen, and  a very soaring one that demon is, an ugly one with a horrendous look. [3-2-5]"
3-2-5," Wearing tiger's skin that is wetted with fat and dampened with blood, he is  frightening to all beings like the wide-open mouth of Death. [3-2-6]"
3-2-6," He skewered three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten spotted deer, and a big head  of an elephant with tusks and fouled with fat on an iron spear, and he is yelling with his  deafening voice. [3-2-7-8a]"
3-2-7," He that demon on seeing Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha ran towards them very angrily,  like the Time, the Eliminator of people. [3-2-8b-9a]"
3-2-8," He shouted a tremulous blare, as though to tremor the earth, and seized Vaidehi  with his arms and gone afar, and then said this way. [9b-10a]"
3-2-9," ""You two wear jute cloths like hermits, but handle arrows, bows and swords like  warriors, yet entered Dandaka forest with your wife... your lives are on the wane...  [3-2-10b-11a]"
3-2-10," ""How saintly are you while living with your wife? You sinful fellows dishonest are  you ways... who are you... you insulters of sainthood? [3-2-11b-12a]"
3-2-11," ""I am a demon named Viradha and I will be on the rove in this impassable forest  with weapon, always eating the flesh of sages... [3-2-12b-13a]"
3-2-12," ""This best waisted woman will be my wife, and I will drink your blood of you two  sinful one in a fight with you... [3-2-13b-14a]"
3-2-13," On listening those arrogant words spoken in bad intent by that evil minded  Viradha, Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, is much panicked. [3-2-14b-15a.]"
3-2-14," Seetha in fear wiggled like a plantain tree in a whirlwind, and on seeing at the  auspicious lady gone into the arms of Viradha, Raghava spoke this sentence to Lakshmana, with his  face fully turning to pale. [3-2-15b-16]"
3-2-15," ""See! Gentle Lakshmana, see that illustrious princes Seetha, the daughter of  emperor Janaka, one who is brought up comfortably in immense comfort, and my auspiciously  traditional wife... now gone into the wretched hands of a demon... [3-2-17-18a]"
3-2-16," ""That which is desired to befall on us, and that which is the choicest desire of  Kaikeyi, and that which is concomitant to her boons, oh, Lakshmana, that has come to pass  quickly, and today only Lakshmana... [3-2-18b-19a]"
3-2-17," ""She who is a foresighted lady, she who is not happy with the kingdom for her son,  she by whom I, a dear one to all beings, am sent to forests, and she is my middle mother, her  desire is fulfilled today, nay now itself... [3-2-19b-20]"
3-2-18," ""To me, oh, Soumitri, the grief of others touching Seetha is more, than father's  demise or grabbing away my kingdom... [3-2-21]"
3-2-19," When said thus by Rama, Lakshmana said this with flooding tears of lament, and in  his anger hissing like a forestalled snake. [3-2-22]"
3-2-20," ""Oh, Rama, you being the Indra like lord of all beings, and while you are being  attended by an adherent like me, what for you worry yourself like a derelict? [3-2-23]"
3-2-21," ""He will now be felled with my arrow as I am enraged at him, and gone are his  lives now, and indeed the earth shall drink his blood... [3-2-24]"
3-2-22," ""Indeed, that which anger was there to me on Bharata when he desired kingdom, that  anger I will now release on Viradha, as Indra released his Thunderbolt on the mountain...  [3-2-25]"
3-2-23," ""Accelerated by my shoulder strength this ruinous arrow shall fall on his massive  chest, thus life from his body shall decamp, and then he shall whirlingly fall onto the earth...""  So said Lakshmana. [3-2-26]"
3-2-24,"The forest  Dandaka Forest wherein Rama is trekking is a dominion of their kingdom, but a deserted forest.  One named Danda, the last son of Ikshvaku, was performing all demonic activities in their  kingdom. His father Ikshvaku received many a complaint about Danda's deeds from his subjects, and  angered at his erring son Danda and banishes him from the kingdom."
3-2-25,"Danda took refuge  in Vindhya mountain range and built a kingdom and a beautiful capital for himself called  Madhumanta. He rubbed shoulders with all the demons thereabout and thus became a disciple of Sage  Shukraachaarya, the guru of demons. One day when Sage Shukraachaarya is not in hermitage, Danda  reaches there, and sees Araja, the elder daughter of the sage Shukra, and molests her, in spite  of her repeated protests. Later when Sage Shukraachaarya comes to know about it, gets enraged and  curses Danda, to fall down along with his entire kingdom under a mud storm around that Madhumanta  capital for a period of seven consecutive days."
3-2-26,"Then there is a  mud storm for seven days and entire kingdom went under mud, later to become a forest called  Dandaka. The place to where the curse fearing people fled from that Madhunata to further south is  called Jansthaana. At later time, when Rama's peregrination started, these two places, Dandaka  forest and Janasthaana, are under the domain of Ravana, and Ravana made one demon named Khara, as  the protector of this dominion Jansthaana."
3-2-27,"This is the place  where Rama built his hermitage Panchavati, at which Demoness Surpanakha arrives, and from where  Ravana abducts Seetha. When Rama asks the forest dwelling sages for a quiet place to live on, the  sages in Dandaka forest, will make Rama constantly move southward, till he reaches Janasthana,  indirectly directing Rama to eradicate the demonic influence over these places, which once  belonged to Rama's kingdom."
3-3-1,"Then in his turn that demon Viradha said this sentence filling the forest with his gruesome voice, I am asking you, really... tell me who you are and whereto you wish to go?  [3-3-1]"
3-3-2,"Then that highly resplendent Rama said about his Ikshvaku dynasty to the blazing faced demon who is insistent. [3-3-2]"
3-3-3,"Know us as Kshatriya-s with ennobled bearing, and we are trekking the forest...but we wish to know about you, who are you that move about in Dandaka forest? [3-3-3]"
3-3-4,"Viradha said to that truly valiant Rama, Ah! I&#39;ll tell you, oh king, be informed of me, oh Raghava... [3-3-4]"
3-3-5,"I am the son of Java indeed... my mother is Shatahradaa, and all the demons on earth call me Viradha...&#39;[3-3-5]"
3-3-6,"On my undertaking ascesis I derived a boon from the beneficence of Brahma, by which I will neither be cut, nor slit, nor killed with a weapon in this world...[3-3-6]"
3-3-7,"Leave off this lady without any yearning for her, and you expeditiously flee-away as you have come, then your lives will not be snatched away... [3-3-7]"
3-3-8,"Rama in reply said this to that ogre Viradha, whose eyes are fully bloodshot in anger, who is monstrous in his body, and evil in intent... [3-3-8]"
3-3-9,"You knave, fie upon you... you are in quest of you own death for your meanly measures, and definitely you will get it in this confrontation. Stay! I will not let you to live... [3-3-9]"
3-3-10,"Then, stringing his bow Rama indeed darted very sharp arrows, very quickly and well aiming the demon... [3-3-10]"
3-3-11,"Indeed seven arrows are let off with perfectly stringed bow, which have golden vanes, and very fast ones that equal the flights of Garuda, the Divine Eagle and the Air-god. [3-3-11]"
3-3-12,"But, they the arrows that are akin to infernos and dressed with peacock feathers as their fins, on piercing the body of Viradha they fell onto the ground besmirched with blood. [3-3-12]"
3-3-13,"When that demon is thus struck, then he placed Vaidehi down from his arms, hauled up his spear, and very angrily rushed towards Rama and Lakshmana. [3-3-13]"
3-3-14,"And holding fast his spear that is similar to the Indra&#39;s Flagstaff he blaringly yelled a ghastly shriek, and thus he shone forth like the wide-mouthed Death, ready-to-gulp. [3-3-14]"
3-3-15,"Then with an effulgent arrow-rain those two brothers incessantly rained on demon Viradha, who is similar to the terminator of lifetime. [3-3-15]"
3-3-16,"He that highly horrendous demon laughed at that arrow-shower, and standing for a while he yawned, and on his yawning and stretching his limbs in fatigue those arrows that earlier have gone speedily, spilled out from his body that speedily. [3-3-16]"
3-3-17,"Demon Viradha held back his lives by the touch of boon, and raising up the spear he ran quickly at Rama and Lakshmana. [3-3-17]"
3-3-18,"The best wielder of weaponry Rama ripped that spear apart, which is akin to the Thunderbolt of Indra, and that which is like a blaze in the sky, with two arrows in the sky itself. [3-3-18]"
3-3-19,"Shattered by Rama&#39;s blazing shafts that spear fallen on ground like the boulder mass of Mt. Meru when it is shattered by Indra&#39;s Thunderbolt. [3-3-19]"
3-3-20,"They quickly upraised their swords and like a pair of up-swinging black-cobras they rapidly crashed on him, and then battered him mightily. [3-3-20]"
3-3-21,"He that demon thus beaten very firmly by Rama and Lakshmana, then on grabbing those unwavering ones and manly tigers with his arms, that furious demon wished to carry them away. [3-3-21]"
3-3-22,"Knowing the thinking of the demon for sure, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, Let him easily carry us anywhere on his way... [3-3-22]"
3-3-23,"Let this demon carry us as he wishes, and Saumitri, by which way this night-walker goes, that alone will be our way... [3-3-23]"
3-3-24,"But he that night-walker arrogant as he is by his might has uplifted Rama and Lakshmana like babies by that might and courage alone, and placed them on his shoulders as one would place babies. [3-3-24]"
3-3-25,"That nightwalker Viradha on placing those two Raghava-s on his shoulders gone towards deeper forest yelling very luridly. [3-3-25]"
3-3-26,"That demon entered into a baffling forest that is like a very dark cloud in its sheen, where a variety of massive trees are contained in, numerous flocks of vulturine birds are overspreading, and where wild jackals and other predaceous animals are sprawling around, along with Rama and Lakshmana. [3-3-26]"
3-3-27,Legend:
3-3-28,"Ikshvaku dynasty is of long lineage. This is Surya Vamsha, Solar dynasty of Kshatriya-s, of which Mahaa Kavi Kalidasa wondered as to how it can be narrated, for it is of a long lineage and he admires <em>kvaH suurya prabhavo vamshH...</em> in his Raghu Vamsha Mahaa Kaavya, at 1-2. This dynasty may be known to understand why from Viradha to Ravana, wanted to die at the hands of Rama. The list of those kings is compiled in <em>aananda raamayana</em> and the same is being given hereunder..."
3-3-29,"<span class=""ItrSloka"">Suurya - IkShvaaku - Kaakuthsa va"
3-4-1,"On seeing those two very dexterous scions of Kakutstha, and the best ones from Raghu dynasty, namely Rama and Lakshmana, grabbed and being carried off, Seetha screamed in a high-pitched voice.[3-4-1]"
3-4-2,"He that truth-abiding, virtuous, and the flawless Rama of Dasharatha is carried off along with Lakshmana by the demon with a ferocious look... [3-4-2]"
3-4-3,"Wild bears, tigers and panthers aspire to eat me away... oh, best demon, thieve me instead and release Kakutstha-s... Hail to thee... [Said Seetha.] [3-4-3]"
3-4-4,"On hearing Vaidehi&#39;s that utterance those valorous ones Rama and Lakshmana speedily busied themselves in eliminating that evil-minded demon Viradha. [3-4-4]"
3-4-5,"Soumitri indeed severed the left arm of that ferocious one, while Rama rent the right arm of that demon with his might. [3-4-5]"
3-4-6,"When his arms are mutilated that demon similar to a dark-cloud is frustrated, fainted, and fell onto ground, like the mountain demolished by the Thunderbolt of Indra. [3-4-6]"
3-4-7,"They battered that demon with their fists, hands and feet, and even by heaving and hurling him again and again they entirely pounded on him on the ground. [3-4-7]"
3-4-8,"Though that demon is battered with many arrows, even sheared off with two swords, and even though he is entirely pounded on the ground he is not killed. [3-4-8]"
3-4-9,"On observing that the mountain-similar demon is ineradicable that easily, then Rama, the sublime one, and the bestower of shelter in fear, spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. [3-4-9]"
3-4-10,"Oh! Manly-tiger Lakshmana, it is impossible to overpower this demon with weapons in a confrontation, hence, let&#39;s bury this demon... [3-4-10]"
3-4-11,"Lakshmana, a very deep pit be dug for this furious and ferocious reprobate in this forest, as though for an elephant... [3-4-11]"
3-4-12,"On saying to Lakshmana that a trench shall be dug...&#39; then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and stood by. [3-4-12]"
3-4-13,"On hearing that said by Raghava, demon Viradha sincerely spoke these humble words to Rama, the finest one from Kakutstha dynasty. [3-4-13]"
3-4-14,"Dead I am, oh! Manly-tiger and a coequal of Indra in your strength... I have fallaciously not identified you earlier... oh, best one among men... [3-4-14]"
3-4-15,"Oh, sire, now I have known you to be Rama, the son of Kausalya... and even propitious Seetha and greatly renowned one Lakshmana are now known to me... [3-4-15]"
3-4-16,"By curse I had to enter this ghoulish demon&#39;s body, but I am a celestial gandharva, named Tumburu and Kubera cursed me... [3-4-16]"
3-4-17,"When entreated by me, he that greatly renowned Kubera said to me, &#39;When Dasharatha&#39;s Rama kills you in a fight... then you will attain your nature of celestial body and you will go to heavens...&#39; [3-4-17, 18a]"
3-4-18," King Kubera thus cursed angrily me for not presenting myself in his service when I was interested in a celestial dancer Rambha, and indeed he alone said this curse-clearance to me... [3-4-18b, 19a]"
3-4-19," And by your grace I am released from this utterly hideous cruse, and now I wish to go to my own heavenly abode, oh, firestorm of enemies, let safety betide you all... [3-4-19b, 20a]"
3-4-20,"Oh, Sire, att one and half yojana-s of distance from here Sage Sharabhanga, a great saint of virtue, and an efficacious sage with sun-like resplendence dwells, you shall quickly approach him for he advises you opportunely... [3-4-20-21]"
3-4-21,"Rama you go safely on burying me in a pit... this is the age-old custom for those demons that lost vitality... those that are inhumed in pit, to them there will be the worlds of manes... [3-4-22, 23a]"
3-4-22,"And on saying thus to Rama that Viradha who is hurt by arrows became heaven-worthy on leaving his body. [3-4-23b, 24a]"
3-4-23,"And Raghava on hearing those words of the demon ordered Lakshmana, Lakshmana, a very deep pit be dug for this furious and ferocious reprobate in this forest, as though for an elephant... On saying to Lakshmana that a trench shall be dug...&#39; then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and stood by. [3-4-24b, 25, 26]"
3-4-24,"Then, on taking a digging tool Lakshmana dug a deep pit beside the great soul Viradha. [3-4-27]"
3-4-25,"On releasing his throat from the stamping of Rama, he that long eared, lurid voiced Viradha is ensconced in that pit while he is still blaring with his horrific voice. [3-4-28]"
3-4-26,"Those deftly victorious ones Rama and Lakshmana who compose themselves in a given fight, both have gladly raised that Viradha, a ghoulish one in fight, a terrifying demon who is still blaring, with all their might and hurled him into the pit. [3-4-29]"
3-4-27,"On observing the indestructibility of that demon with any weapon, however sharp it might be, those two best ones among men that are very expertly skilled have thought over well and undertook the elimination of that great demon in a pit. [3-4-30]"
3-4-28,"Viradha himself preferred his death at the hands of Rama and desired for a long to be killed by Rama and that forest walker himself appraised that, Killing me with any weapon is impossible... [3-4-31]"
3-4-29,"On listening to that which is said by Viradha, Rama resolved his mind to cast him into pit, and when that mighty demon is being flung into the pit the whole forest blared with that demon&#39;s cries. [3-4-32]"
3-4-30,"Rama and Lakshmana felt happy by way of their look in burying Viradha in the pit of the earth, and on burying him they two felt rejoiced for gone is the fear in that great forest, and within the pit they have also concealed him with boulders in order to make it a burial-chamber to the departed soul. [3-4-33]"
3-4-31,"Then they two who have dazzling golden bows have eliminated that demon and retrieved Seetha, and they gladly journeyed on in that great forest like the two entities abiding on the skies, namely the Sun and Moon. [3-4-34]"
3-4-32,"The episode of Viraadha assumes some importance in Hindu mythology. It may be observed that Viraadha drops down Seetha, lifts and carries Rama and Lakshmana far away from Seetha, where Rama and Lakshmana kill Viraadha. <em>aadhyaatma raamaayana</em> which occurs in the chapter 61 of<em>brahmaanmda puraana</em> also narrates this episode of Viradha as a one to one fight, herein Rama affronts and kills him straight. But in Valmiki Ramayana, Viradha takes away Seetha first and then Rama and Lakshmana, too. A question arises as to why the demon should snatch Seetha away and later carry Rama and Lakshmana to a distant place from Seetha. It is part of the scheme that Rama kills no demon or sinner in the presence of Seetha, including Ravana, for she is that benevolent one to all the sinners and pardons them if surrendered in faith at her feet, as an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi. Our concern here is with <em>skaanda purana</em> , a Shiva Puraana, in which Viradha&#39;s episode is explained detailedly. The <em>skaanda puraana</em> puts it as:"
3-4-33,"On seeing Seetha Viraaadha thought,  She is the Supreme goddess through whom heavens can be obtained by salvation and also release from the bondage [of demon&#39;s body ] On just seeing Her, relieved is this body cage, so with all my devotion, I steal Her . etc. Hence <em>vi raadha</em> meant to be verily, devout, like Radha of Krishna. When chased and hurt by Rama and Lakshmana, the demon releases Seetha, but carries both the brothers away. For this distancing Rama and Lakshmana from Seetha, it is said that Rama does not kill any demon in the presence of Seetha, for she graciously condones the mischief of the demons, if they are true devotees."
3-4-34,"Again in <em>skaanda puraana</em>, at the end of this Viraaadha episode, the <em>phala shruti</em> [Fruit of Listening] it is narrated as:"
3-4-35," Those that always listen or let listen this episode of virAdha, all their sins are absolved, undoubtedly .. skaanda pauraana</h4><p class=""ItrSloka"">"
3-5-1,"After killing that stupendously mighty demon Viradha in forest, then Rama comfortingly embraced Seetha, and spoke to his brother Lakshmana who is beaming forth with resplendence. [3-5-1]"
3-5-2,"Difficult is this impassable forest, nor we are forest inhabitants either... let&#39;s go quickly to that ascetically rich sage Sharabhanga... [3-5-2b, 3a]"
3-5-3,"On his approach at the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga, a sage with a divine effect and the one with a purified soul, saw a great wonder at the nearby of that hermitage of Sharabhanga.[3-5-3b, 4]"
3-5-4,"Rama has seen Indra, the lord of three worlds, with a radiant body that has the coupled radiance of Sun and Fire, mounted on a great chariot that does not touch the earth, wearing greatly brilliant ornaments and attired in spotless dress, while the other divinities are attending, and many more selfsame great-souls are worshipping him. [3-5-5, 6, 7a]"
3-5-5,"Rama saw at his very nearby a chariot yoked with green horses that traverses in firmament, which in its splendour is either like the noontime sun, or a cluster of silver clouds, or like the silvern sphere of the moon. [3-5-7b, 8]"
3-5-6,"He saw the stainless parasol of Indra, marvellously garlanded and shining forth, and the exemplary and invaluable royal fanning instruments with golden handles, which two best female celestials are handling and fanning at Indra&#39;s head sides with them. [3-5-9, 10a]"
3-5-7,"And the celestials like gandharva-s, amara-s, siddhaa-s and very many great sages as well are extolling Indra who is abiding in firmament. [3-5-10b, 11a]"
3-5-8,"On seeing Indra speaking there to sage Sharabhanga, Rama spoke to Lakshmana. [3-5-11b, 12a]"
3-5-9,"Rama then on pointing out the chariot expressed his own amazement saying, Lakshmana see this wonderful chariot that includes effulgence and auspiciousness as well, and that abides in firmament, and highly luminous like the Sun... [3-5-12b, 13]"
3-5-10,"Of which horses we have earlier heard from our teachers telling that they belong to Indra, the Chief Invitee in Vedic rituals, they are these divinely green horses that now abide in the firmament, and definitely these must be Indra&#39;s horses... [3-5-14]"
3-5-11,"And oh, manly-tiger Lakshmana, those that are there in hundreds and hundreds around Indra, those youthful ones with their ear-ornaments and swords in hands, with wide and broad chests, with club shaped arms, and clad in glimmering red garments, all are like tigers, all are unapproachable, all of them are wearing ornamental chains on their chest-place that are akin to flaring fires, and in their appearance, Soumitri, they always bear a look of twenty-five-year-olds... [3-5-15, 16, 17]"
3-5-12,"The age factor of gods remains constant at the age that appears for these nice-looking Tigerly-men, so they say... for gods are immortals and they will be ever young... [3-5-18]"
3-5-13,"Stay for a moment Lakshmana along with Vaidehi, until I know clearly about that resplendent one on that chariot... [3-5-19]"
3-5-14,"On saying to Lakshmana stay there only...&#39; Rama proceeded towards the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga.. [3-5-20]"
3-5-15,"Then, on seeing Rama arriving there, Indra, bade farewell to Sage Sharabhanga and said this to the celestials attending him. [3-5-21]"
3-5-16,"Here comes that Rama...before he talks to me, you lead him towards his vow, after completing the result of his incarnation, then only he is eligible to see me... Let him be a victorious and accomplished one, then I will see him very soon...for that will happen very soon... A great deed is to be verily performed by him that is highly impossible for others... [3-5-22, 23"
3-5-17,"Then that Enemy-destroyer Indra adoringly bade farewell to the sage, and travelled to heavens by the chariot with its green horses. [3-5-24]"
3-5-18,"On the transit of that Thousand-eyed Indra, Raghava with his adherents [namely Lakshmana and Seetha,] came nearby the Sage Sharabhanga, who is sitting nearby the altar of fire. [3-5-25]"
3-5-19,"Touching the feet of that Sage Sharabhanga Rama along with Seetha and Lakshmana, and duly permitted and invited by that Sage Sharabhanga they sat there, as they obtained a shelter. [3-5-26]"
3-5-20,"Then, Raghava enquired with sage about the arrival of Indra and Sage Sharabhanga narrated all that to him. [3-5-27]"
3-5-21,"Oh! Rama, that boon-giver Indra wishes to take me to Brahma&#39;s abode, which is achieved by me by my arduous ascesis and that which is unattainable for them with their souls unconquered... [3-5-28]"
3-5-22,"On knowing that you are course is nearby, oh! Manly-tiger, and without seeing my dear guest I do not wish to go to Brahma&#39;s abode... [3-5-29]"
3-5-23," Having met with you, a virtuous one and a great soul as you are, oh, manly-tiger, I wish to go through undesirable lesser heavens to Brahma&#39;s abode, the highest [3-5-30]"
3-5-24,"Oh! Tigerly-man, non-diminishing are the abodes achieved by me either in Brahma&#39;s abode or yonder than paradise...you take them all...that are mine achieved by me ascesis... So said Sage Sharabhanga to Rama. [3-5-31]"
3-5-25,"Thus said by the Sage Sharabhanga to that Manly-tiger Rama, being the scholar in all the scriptures he spoke this sentence to that sage. [3-5-32]"
3-5-26,"I alone can gain all those worlds, oh! Great Saint, I now seek a place to dwell here in this forest as indicated by you... [Apparent meaning.] [3-5-33]"
3-5-27,"I will however take all those worlds of yours, for you have waited for me and dedicated whatever you achieved by your penance at my tri-feet, as <em>atithi satkaara</em>, honouring guests - &#39; leaving &#39;the doer and doing&#39; attachment, and without desire to enjoy the fruits of works, as a <em>karma phala tyaagi</em> . For now, show me a place to dwell in this forest like an ordinary human being - [Implicit meaning according to Govindaraja.]"
3-5-28,"I will win-over all those worlds myself, as Kshatriya-s are not supposed to take any donations; they either have to won by them or acquire them for themselves, just show me a place to dwell - [Maheshvara Tirtha.]"
3-5-29,"Everything merges in me alone, for I alone gave all these to you, and you also dedicated the same in me, without the concept of doer and doing - [which again is reiterated in Bhagavad Gita -<em>labhatecha tataH kaamaan mayaiva vihitaan</em> || 7-22 &#39; All the desires of the adherent like Brahma&#39;s abode, immortality etc., are acquired at my grace.&#39; for now show me a place to live - [Another concept. tani sloki.]"
3-5-30,"Thus said by Raghava, who is like Indra in strength, that supremely intellectual Sage Sharabhanga again spoke this sentence this way. [3-5-34]"
3-5-31,"Here, oh! Rama, a great resplendent sage named Suteekshna, lives in this forest...a virtuous and a self-disciplined one, and he will do something benignant to you... [3-5-35]"
3-5-32,"You approach Sage Suteekshna and to you he will arrange housing in his auspicious and dpleasant place woods of hermits... [3-5-36]"
3-5-33," Following opposite to its flow you may follow this River Mandaakini that carries flower-ferries, then you can reach there at Sage Suteekshna&#39;s hermitage...] [3-5-37]"
3-5-34,"This is the only way, oh, manly-tiger, and oh, sire, see me for a moment, till I forsake these body parts of mine, like a snake casting its withered moult... [3-5-38]"
3-5-35,"Then that hymnist on invoking the sacred fire and offering oblations with clarified butter into it, that radiant sage Sharabhanga entered that sacred fire. [3-5-39]"
3-5-36,"The fire burnt down that great soul Sharabhanga from head-hair to body hair and thus his shrunk skin, bones and whatever flesh and blood are there, they are also burnt completely. [3-5-40]"
3-5-37,"Those who obtained divine knowledge about this mortal body, and those that cannot practice <em>anuSThaana</em> their daily chores, or with any incapability, and those that have left house as holder, and desiccated, could give up their mortal bodies into fire, waters or falling from mountain peaks."
3-5-38,"He that Sage Sharabhanga, then reappeared as an youngster in the semblance of Fire, on resurrecting from that altar of fire he shone-forth. [3-5-41]"
3-5-39,"He that Sage Sharabhanga, transcending the ethereal worlds of fire-worshippers, of saints, of great souls, and also of divinities, has ascended to Brahma&#39;s abode. [3-5-42]"
3-5-40,"He that meritorious and best Brahman Sharabhanga has seen Brahma in Brahma&#39;s abode, and Brahma too, on seeing that Brahman happily spoke to him... Welcome... [3-5-43]"
3-6-1," On Sage Sharabhanga attaining heaven, groups of sages assembled and approached  Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, who is glowing with resplendence. [3-6-1]"
3-6-2," The sages called Vaikahanasa-s, [who are born out of the nails of Prajaapati, the  first ruler of mankind,] also Vaalakhilyaa-s, [those born from His hair,] and those from the  water of His feet-wash, and those that thrive on drinking rays of sun and moon alone, and those  that pound with stones and others who thrive on leaves alone, are those sages... [3-6-2]"
3-6-3," Some of them use their own teeth to grid the grain they eat, and some who perform  ascesis in neck-deep water, and some who sleep with their head resting on their shoulders or on  chests without using any kind of bed, and some who do not use any kind of beds either, and some  who meditate without any repose sitting in an enclosure without any leg-space. [3-6-3]"
3-6-4," And some sages whose food is water alone, or air alone to some, like that some who  meditate staying in sky and some who sleep on bare ground itself. [3-6-4]"
3-6-5," Thus some are dwellers on high-peaked places with their senses controlled, and  some are wearers of wet cloths, always reciting name or hymn japa and like that some who meditate  with five kinds of fire around them. [3-6-5]"
3-6-6," All have Vedic resplendence and firm yogic control, and they have arrived at the  hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga for Rama. [3-6-6]"
3-6-7," Those virtuous sages coming together in groups neared Rama, the best beholder of  virtue, and said to that supreme one in virtue. [3-6-7]"
3-6-8," ""You are the supreme charioteer born in Ikshvaku dynasty hence you are the  protector of earth under your control. As with Indra, the ruler of divinities you are a similar  ruler for us. [3-6-8]"
3-6-9," Though born in Ikshvaku dynasty you are the Supreme Charioteer, hence you are the  same Supreme Charioteer of this Earth and earthlings too, as with Indra who protects divinities,  you are our protector."
3-6-10," ""You are well renowned in all the three worlds by your repute and valour, and in  you abounding are the virtues like truthfulness and devotion to your father, and even  righteousness too, is there. [3-6-9]"
3-6-11," ""You are the great-souled one, knower of righteousness and a patron of virtue...  such as you are, on approaching you we beg to state something for which we may please be  excused... [3-6-10]"
3-6-12," ""Oh! , very great a-dharma, wrongness, will occur to that king who takes the sixth  part of the country's produce as cess, but does not safeguard his subjects like his own sons...  [3-6-11]"
3-6-13," ""A king shall treat all the subjects of kingdom as his own sons, and he shall  protect them as though he is ready to save them at the cost of his own lives, and he who will  always be endeavouring in that manner will attain permanent renown lasting for many for many  years to come, and thereby he attains a prosperous place even in Brahma's abode... [3-6-12,  3]"
3-6-14," ""He who righteously protects his subjects will get one fourth of the merit of  great duty-bound deeds performed by each individual sage, say yajna-s, ascesis, meditation etc.  performances. [3-6-14]"
3-6-15," ""O, Rama, though you are there as protector for the hermitages, suchlike this one,  where the most reverent Brahmans are there numerously, they look as though forsaken, for they are  being demolished by demons, devastatingly... [3-6-15]"
3-6-16," ""Come and see many of the bodies of the sages, the contemplative souls, that are  variously killed by ghastly demons in the forest... [3-6-16]"
3-6-17," ""At Pampa riverside, and alongside of River Mandakini, and at the surroundings of  Mt. Chitrakuta also, this hideous warfare is being done... [3-6-17]"
3-6-18," ""Thus. we are not able to tolerate this injustice to the sages, being executed in  this forest by the demons with fiendish deeds, in a ghastly manner... [3-6-18]"
3-6-19," ""Therefore we present ourselves before you as you are our protector, for the  purpose of your protecting us that are being killed by nightwalkers... please safe guard us...  [3-6-19]"
3-6-20," ""Other than you, oh, valorous Rama, no way-out is deducible on this earth, hence  oh, prince, protect all of us from the demons... [3-6-20]"
3-6-21," On hearing all that is said by the sages of great penance, he that virtue souled  Rama said this unto all of the sages. [3-6-21]"
3-6-22," ""Unapt is this way of speaking to me...command me, for I am at your behest... just  for my personal purpose I had to enter the forests.... [3-6-22]"
3-6-23," ""I entered this forest as ordered by my father and even to obliterate the  unconscionable state of yours owing to the misdeeds of demons. [3-6-23]"
3-6-24," ""Perchance I have come for the achievement of your purpose, such as I am, dwelling  in this forest will immensely be fruitful to me... [3-6-24]"
3-6-25," ""I wish to eliminate demons, the enemies of sages, in war... let the sages behold  my valour, and my brother's valour in doing so..."" Thus Rama promised the sages. [3-6-25]"
3-6-26," Thus giving his aegis to the sages, that valiant Rama who is firmly virtue-souled,  journeyed towards Sage Suteekshna with Lakshmana and the sages, and along with the one given by  Honourable Janaka, namely Seetha. [3-6-26]"
3-7-1,"Rama arrives at the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna, as directed by Sage Sharabhanga in the previous chapter and asks the sage to show a place to dwell. Suteekshna asks Rama to stay at his own hermitage, which has no other problems than the wild animals that come in herds and make blaring noises. Rama wishes to kill those animals that hamper the tranquillity of hermits living therein, but having observed the kindness of Suteekshna towards those wild animals, however disturbing they may be, Rama refrains to kill them, and would like to go to any other place than this. They spend that night there."
3-7-2,"Rama, the enemy-scorcher, has gone towards the threshold of the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna along with his brother Lakshmana and Seetha, also along with those Brahmans who accompanied him all the way. [4-7-1]"
3-7-3,"He travelling on a long way, and on crossing rivers with plenty of waters has seen a tranquil mountain towering like great Mt. Meru. [3-7-2]"
3-7-4,"Then those best ones from Ikshvaku dynasty, those two Raghava-s along with Seetha have entered the forest which will always be full with diverse trees. [3-7-3]"
3-7-5,"Entering that perilous forest with its many a flower and fruit bearing trees, they have seen the hermitage in a reclusive place adorned with rows of jute cloths as though garlanding it. [3-7-4]"
3-7-6,"There on seeing the ascetically rich Sage Suteekshna sitting in yogic posture with his body bearing lotus-like blotches of soil, Rama dutifully spoke to him. [3-7-5]"
3-7-7,"Oh! godly sage I am Rama, I have come to see you, hence oh, knower of virtue, oh, great sage, oh, one with truthfulness as your courage, please talk to me... [3-7-6]"
3-7-8,"Then that sage having seen that brave and best proponent of virtue, Rama, embraced him with both of his hands, and spoke this sentence. [3-7-7]"
3-7-9,"Welcome to you Rama, best of Raghu dynasty and the best patron of truth, and when you presently caught this hermitage unprepared this has become a well-lorded one... [3-7-8]"
3-7-10,"I am awaiting for you only, oh, greatly renowned one, without my ascent to heavens by casting off this body on the earth&#39;s plane, oh, brave one, for I have heard that you have arrived at Chitrakuta after you are repudiated from your kingdom... [3-7-9]"
3-7-11,"The king of gods and the chief invitee in hundred sacrifices Indra approached me, and that great deity said me that I have conquered all the worlds by my meritorious deeds... [3-7-10, 11]"
3-7-12,"Let me bequeath those worlds that are cherished by gods and sages alike, but which are won over by me by my ascesis, and you enjoy in them with your wife and with your brother Lakshmana... [3-7-12]"
3-7-13,"That self-respecting Rama replied the radiant sage with intense asceticism, a great soul and an advocate of truth by himself, as Indra would reply to Brahma. [3-7-13]"
3-7-14,"I alone can gain all those worlds, oh, great saint, I now seek a place to dwell here in this forest as indicated by you... [3-7-14]"
3-7-15,"You are an expert in all affairs, and you are interested in the welfare of all the beings, so said the great souled Sage Sharabhanga of Sage Gautama&#39;s dynasty... [So said Rama to the sage.] [3-7-15]"
3-7-16,"When said thus by Rama, that great sage with world renown spoke sweet worded sentence with great pleasure. [3-7-16]"
3-7-17,"You can take delight in this good featured hermitage alone, for groups of sages will always be moving here, and this always contains tubers and fruits... Thus said Sage Suteekshna. [3-7-17]"
3-7-18,"But herds of very large animals will be coming to this hermitage, they return after scaring us, of course without killing anyone, and they fear none... [3-7-18]"
3-7-19,"Know that no other problem is there other than the animals... So said the sage. On hearing those words of that great sage, that brave elder brother of Lakshmana taking bow and arrow said this sentence. [3-7-19, 20a]"
3-7-20,"I will eradicate them, oh, greatly blessed one, those animals that will come collectively in herds with sharp edged, curve-end arrows... [3-7-20b, 21a]"
3-7-21,"But you may be more interested in those animals mercifully, then what will be there more painful to you, hence I deem our staying in this hermitage for along will be unbefitting... So said Rama. [3-7-21b, 22a]"
3-7-22,"On saying thus to the sage then Rama came by the twilight, and he paused at it. On worshipping the westward vesperal time, Rama arranged a stay for himself along with Seetha and Lakshmana, there in that delightful hermitage of Sage Suteekshna. [3-7-22b, 23]"
3-7-23,"Then the great soul Sage Suteekshna on completing his evening rituals and on observing the fall of night he himself courteously served food that is auspicious and worthy of sages to two of the best men, Rama and Lakshmana. [3-7-23]"
3-7-24,"In<font color=""#B3003A"">aascharya raamayana</font> , another traditional rendering of this epic, it is said that Rama, while staying at this hermitage when night advanced, went out of the hermitage and killed all those animals. Not the above mentioned deer, but very big, blaring animals. The thrust of his arrows made the carcasses of those massive animals fall before the demon Kabandha. Kabandha is a cursed angle and will be released of his curse later by Rama. This Kabandha has no body parts below his chest, but has long hands with which he captures his prey that comes within the ambit of his long and strong hands. Kabandha is thus fed upon the kill of Rama, because Kabandha is a keynote character in giving information to Rama, and he is to be kept alive till such time. But all this is unknown to other in-mates of the hermitage, including Seetha. The next morning Rama, in a personal conversation with Seetha, reveals what he has done during the previous night, to her surprise and praise.</font>"
3-8-1,"Rama along with Soumitri is well revered by Sage Suteekhsna, spent that night there and awoken in the morning. [3-8-1]"
3-8-2,"Rama got up according to time along with Seetha and touched finely cool water with lotus-fragrance for morning bath. [3-8-2]"
3-8-3,"Then they all, Vaidehi, Rama and Lakshmana, on worshipping sacred fire and deities dutifully in the shelter of the sages in that forest and on seeing the dawning sun, they are reft of their blemishes, and then they approached Sage Suteekshna speaking this sentence gently. [3-8-3, 4]"
3-8-4,"We stayed here happily, oh, god, venerated by a venerable one like you, and here we come to ask your permission as we wish to journey on, as the sages are hastening us... [3-8-5]"
3-8-5,"We make haste to see the habitats of hermitages in their entirety, and even wish to see the sages with meritorious selves living in Dandaka forest... [3-8-6]"
3-8-6,"We wish to have your permission, and that of these eminent sages, who are ever virtuous, self-controlled by their ascesis, and who look like the veritable tongues of sacred fire... [3-8-7]"
3-8-7,"We wish to proceed before sun attains an intolerable glare, like an unworthy person of unworthy lineage attains wealth in an improper way with much glare... saying so Rama with Seetha and Lakshmana venerated at the feet of that sage Suteekshna. [3-8-8, 9]"
3-8-8,"That eminent sage lifted them that are touching his feet, embraced them tightly, and said this sentence in all his friendliness. [3-8-10]"
3-8-9,"Proceed in an invulnerable way, Rama, along with Lakshmana, and with this Seetha while she follows you closely like a shadow... [3-8-11]"
3-8-10,"See the pleasant thresholds of the hermitages of the dwellers in the forests of Dandaka, oh! Valiant one, whose souls are consecrated just by their ascesis... [3-8-2]"
3-8-11,"See the well-flowered woodlands with well-grown fruits and tubers, with herds of best animals and peaceful bird flocks... tranquil waters with spreading clusters of bloomed lotuses and water-birds in the pools and lakes... eye-pleasing rapids from mountains and you can see pleasant forests loaded with the hearty screams of precooks... [3-8-13, 14, 15]"
3-8-12,"My dear Rama, you may go and Soumitri you too also may go... but come again towards this hermitage after seeing all of them... [3-8-16]"
3-8-13,"Thus said by the sage, Rama in his turn said to him, so be it... and having performed circumambulations around the sage he started to journey on. [3-8-17]"
3-8-14,"Then the broad eyed Seetha gave auspicious quivers and bows to those brothers and then spotless swords too. [3-8-18]"
3-8-15,"Both of those two Rama and Lakshmana tied their beautiful quivers well on their backs, and took the twangy bows and exited from that hermitage to go on their way. [3-8-19]"
3-8-16,"Those two Raghava-s, the handsome princes, have swiftly set out when permitted by that august sage, wielding bows and swords, and along with Seetha. [3-8-20]"
3-9-1,"To Rama, the scion of Raghu and her husband, who started out when permitted by Sage Suteekshna, Vaidehi spoke this with friendly words. [3-9-1]"
3-9-2,"Gross unjust will accrue to any in an abstruse way if his indulgence is enkindled merely by his own desire, and in this world it is possible to fend them off, to have a recourse to justness... [3-9-2]"
3-9-3,"Only three self-gratifications, the definite products of desire, are there: one is speaking fallacious utterances, which itself is worse, and worst than the other two malefic self-gratifications, where the other two are the fascination for other&#39;s wife, and the cruelness without enmity...

3-9-4,"j</span>aH</em>= desire produced; <em>dashako guNaH</em>= ten, traits."
3-9-5,"Hunting, sleeping in daytime, abusing others, indulgence in women, three artistic impulses namely music, dance and drama, wasteful wandering, are the ten desire. Manu smriti."
3-9-6,"The habit of telling specious words is not there with you in the past nor it will be there in future, oh, Raghava, then wherefrom the virtue-ruining desire for other&#39;s women can be there... [3-9-4b, 5a]"
3-9-7,"Oh, king, earlier this vile desire for other&#39;s women is absent in you, nor it is there now, unobserved is such a desire in any corner of your heart oh, prince, for you are always interested in your own wife... [3-9-5, 6]"
3-9-8,"You are conscientious, adherent of truth, and obliging father&#39;s orders, and in you virtue and truth, nay everything is established in you... [3-9-7]"
3-9-9,"Oh, dextrous one, all this can possibly be shouldered by one with controlled senses, and oh, graceful one for a gaze, I am also aware of your sense control... [3-9-8]"
3-9-10,"That third tendency to torture others&#39; lives without enmity, that which will usually be effectuated unwarily, has now suddenly chanced before you... [3-9-9]"
3-9-11,"Intending to safeguard the sages you have promised the dwellers in Dandaka forest, oh, valiant one, that you would eliminate demons in a fight... [3-9-10]"
3-9-12,"Only in this respect you have started towards the well-known Dandaka forest along with your brother, and wielding bow and arrows...[3-9-11]"
3-9-13,"Then on seeing your starting my mind is apprehensively upset, on verily reflecting about your bearing there appears to be no beneficial good for you... [3-9-12]"
3-9-14,"Oh, brave one, your going towards Dandaka forest is not delightful to me, I tell the cause for that and listen to it as I tell...[3-9-13]"
3-9-15,"Indeed on entering the forest along with your brother, and wielding bow and arrows, seeing the forest ramblers there, won&#39;t you deplete arrows on all of them... [3-9-14]"
3-9-16,"The bow of warrior and the fuel of a burning fire if available within their reach, they immensely enhance their strength... [3-9-15]"
3-9-17,"Once upon a time, oh, dextrous one, there was a pious and true worded hermit in some merited forest that was wonted by animals and birds... [3-9-16]"
3-9-18,"Then Indra came to that hermitage handling a sword, and donning a soldier&#39;s guise, to cause hindrance to that hermit&#39;s ascesis... [3-9-17]"
3-9-19,"Indra gave that best sword to store, there in that hermitage to that sage who is lasting in his ascesis, on a redeemable basis... [3-9-18]"
3-9-20,"On receiving that sword, he who is duteous in guarding the entrustment, moved about in the forest always handling the sword, to safeguard the confidence reposed in him... [3-9-19]"
3-9-21,"Wherever that dedicated guardian of that entrustment goes, even to obtain tubers or fruits, he did not go without that sword... [3-9-20]"
3-9-22,"Carrying that sword always, that hermit slowly made his own faculty infuriated, loosing determination in ascesis... [3-9-21]"
3-9-23,"Then with the constant association of that weapon that sage gradually became inadvertent, and smitten by vice he went to hell... [3-9-22]"
3-9-24,"Thus, all this happened earlier, only owing the reason of associating with a weapon constantly, and the sequel of constant association with weapon is as good as constant association with fire... [3-9-23]"
3-9-25,"In affinity and in respect I am reminding but not tutoring you, and in anyway improper is that thought of yours to wield your bow to kill the demons dwelling in Dandaka without any enmity, oh, brave one, undesirable is the killing of offenceless... [3-9-24, 25]"
3-9-26,"For the valiant Kshatriya-s who are inclined in forests heartily, the purpose of the bow is this much &#39;safeguarding the sufferers...&#39; [3-9-26]"
3-9-27,"Where that weapon? Where this forest? Where the principles of Kshatriya? And where is sageness? All this is inconsistent... let us esteem the laws of the land... [3-9-27]"
3-9-28,"Weapon admiring mind becomes maligned with avariciousness, you may therefore follow the tenet of Kshatriya-s on going to Ayodhya again... [3-9-28]"
3-9-29,"Everlasting satisfaction will be there to my father-in-law and mothers-in-laws, on your becoming a devout sage even after forfeiture of kingdom... [3-9-29]"
3-9-30,"From virtuousness prosperity emanates, from righteousness happiness, and by honourableness all are achieved, and this universe is the essence of probity... [3-9-30]"
3-9-31,"Experts will make efforts to exhaust their own selves with those and those principles, thus they realise sublimity... unachievable is pleasure by pleasuring alone... [3-9-31]"
3-9-32,"Always tread along the righteousness with a pure mind, oh, gentle one, and specially in these sagely forests... you know everything in all the three worlds, in all its nuances... [3-9-32]"
3-9-33,"I cite all this with my womanly waver, and who is capable to talk to you about dharma? Ponder mindfully along with your brother, and what that is appropriate, you do it...but not belatedly... [3-9-33]"
3-9-34,"This particular chapter is an interesting juncture in Ramayana, where Seetha reminds about the question of triggering cause for Rama&#39;s waging a war against demons. Seetha&#39;s doubt is well explained in Dharmaakuutam, the encyclopaedic commentary on Ramayana. A number of pages are allotted there for this chapter, and it is said there, that if Seetha is said to be self-contradictory in telling Rama that bow and arrows are a must to Kshatriya-s to protect the helpless when saying &#39;safeguard the sufferers, then only Kshatriya-s should use their bow... as at verse 3-9-26 above, and also questioning immediately at 3-9-27, &#39;where the Kshatriya dharma, where the hermit&#39;s way of living...&#39; etc., dharmaakuutam says not so. She is not contradicting herself in her statements, but asking Rama to have a cause, without resorting to weaponry against those demons, in a straightforward way.<em>ataH tad rakShaNaaya aayudhamna graahyam iti etad abhipraayakatvaat ||</em>"
3-9-35,"She is inquisitive to know why Rama alone shall raise the bow and arrows against some demons hurting some sages. These sages are having super powers and Indra like celestial chiefs are coming to these sages to take them to heaven with their mortal bodies. Can&#39;t they eliminate these demons? But these super hermits are not going to heaven, which is the minimum ambition of any penance, but requesting Rama to protect them from demons. And Rama obligingly started to wage this unilateral war, where any war requires a triggering point. Can&#39;t the super sages eliminate these demons, with their powers acquired by their penances? This is the question of Seetha. For this, Rama replies so convincingly in the next chapter, saying that the sages cannot issue forth a curse at the demons, in the course of their penance."
3-9-36,"Sage Vishvamitra, though being a furious sage, once sought the help of Rama to counter the Demoness Tataka. And Rama rendered it. Now also these sages do not waste their powers at the mischievous demons, but ask Rama to safeguard their interests, for Rama is the king, whether he may be in capital or in forests."
3-9-37,"Secondly, Rama is subjected to the throne of Ayodhya, now being held by his brother Bharata, and as a loyalist to that throne, Ram should act in accordance with the rules of his kingdom. This area Dandaka forests is under the ambit of their own kingdom. So Rama has to perform the deeds suitable to their kingdom. When killing Vali, Rama speaks to Vali -- all this area is under our kingdom, now held by Bharata, and it is my duty to act in accordance with the decree of that throne..."
3-9-38,"Regarding the cause, Seetha&#39;s doubt comes true and she alone becomes the ultimate cause for Rama, to wage the final war with Ravana."
3-10-1,"On hearing all of the words said by Vaidehi, in adoration of her husband, he who abides by virtue alone that Rama replied Janaki. [4-10-1]"
3-10-2,"You have said beneficial, friendlily words that are seemlier to your disposition, oh, lady, which are apt to speak of your familial brought up, for you are the daughter of virtue-knowing Janaka. [4-10-2]"
3-10-3,"What more shall I say, oh, lady, since it is said that &#39;a warrior handles a bow so that misery&#39;s tears cease to flow...&#39; and this saying is iterated even by you... [4-10-3]"
3-10-4,"Oh! Seetha, those shleterable sages of Dandaka forest have approached me sombrely on their own, and thus they came into my refuge... [4-10-4]"
3-10-5,"Subsisting on fruits and tubers, living at all the time in forests those sages are not getting quietude, as they are scared by the demons with invidious deeds... [4-10-5]"
3-10-6,"The sages dwelling in Dandaka forest are being eaten away by fiendish demons that subsist on human flesh, and while being eaten away like that those eminent Brahmans have said to me, please come to our rescue... [4-10-6,7a]"
3-10-7,"This way when I have heard the words voiced by them, I comforted them verbally and avouched this way, Be gracious to me... you all... by which reason I am being addressed this way by this kind of eminent Brahmans, whom I should have actually addressed my self, this indeed is a dishonour for me... [4-10-7b, 8, 9a]"
3-10-8,"Then I said before the Brahmans, what shall I do? All of them thus thronged and spoke this word. [4-10-9b, 10a]"
3-10-9,"Many of the guise changing demons are outrightly torturing us in Dandaka forest, hence in that context you shall protect us... [4-10-10b, 11a]"
3-10-10,"Those resistless carnivorous demons, oh, merited Rama, will descend exactly at the time of fire oblations, or on propitious times like full or new moons to persecute us... [4-10-11b, 12a]"
3-10-11,"We the ascetics being assaulted thus are aggrieved, and when we searched for a recourse you chanced as our ultimate course... [4-10-12b, 13a]"
3-10-12,"We by the efficacy of our ascesis are surely capable to eradicate those demons, but we do not wish to shorten the effect of our long earned merit of ascesis... [4-10-13b, 14a]"
3-10-13,"Many hurdles are always there in our practice of ascesis, and even the ascesis have become impracticable, oh, Raghava, thus though being eaten away by the demons we are not issuing any curse... [4-10-14b, 15a]"
3-10-14,"Thereby, you along with your brother protect us that are being persecuted by the demons dwelling in Dandaka forest as you alone are the protector of ours in these forests...&#39;so said sages to me... [4-10-15b, 16a]"
3-10-15,"On hearing all those words, oh, Seetha, I promised complete protection to the sages of Dandaka forests... [4-10-16b, 17a]"
3-10-16,"Having promised to the sages it is incapable of me to implement it otherwise while I am alive... truth is dearer to me, isn&#39;t it... [4-10-17b, 18a]"
3-10-17,"I may forfeit my life, forgo Lakshmana, or even forsake you but not a promise, that too especially made to Brahmans, and having promised I can never go back... [4-10-18b, 19a]"
3-10-18,"By that reason, oh, Seetha, even if I am unasked, safeguarding sages is definitely to be done by me, how then it is undone when given a promise... [4-10-19b, 20a]"
3-10-19,"With your friendship and good-heartedness you say these words, oh, Seetha, I am contended... uninterested ones do not forewarn, indeed... [4-10-20b, 21a]"
3-10-20,"Appropriate and seemly is your word of caution to your bloodline, oh, graceful Seetha, you are the co-pursuer in dharma with me, hence you are loftier to me than my own lives... So said Rama to Seetha. [4-10-21b, c]"
3-10-21,"That exalted soul Rama on saying those words to Seetha, his dear wife and the daughter of Janaka, wielding his bow proceeded further with Lakshmana to the picturesque woodlands of hermits. [4-10-22]"
3-11-1,"Rama travelled ahead while the glorious Seetha in middle, and wielding bow Lakshmana followed them on the rear. [4-11-1]"
3-11-2,"They proceeded while seeing diverse mountain terraces, forests, and diversely enchanting rivers too, along with Seetha. [4-11-2]"
3-11-3,"Beholding the rivers that have water-birds like saarasa, chakravaaka that move on their sandbanks, and also the lakes that contain lotuses and water born birds, they moved on. [4-11-3]"
3-11-4,"The moved on watching spotted deer banded in herds, the wild boars, large horned buffaloes maddened in virility, and the ruttish elephants rending trees like their enemies. [4-11-4]"
3-11-5,"On going far on their way, and when the sun is dangling in the western skiy, together they saw a charming lake of one yojana width fully overloaded with red and white lotuses, overspread with sporting elephants, and over-flurried with waterfowls like saarasa birds, kaadamba birds, swans and with others kinds too. [4-11-5, 6]"
3-11-6,"Out of the tranquil and enchanting waters of that lake audible are the melodies of singing and musical instruments, but none is visible. [4-11-7]"
3-11-7,"Then Rama and also Lakshmana, the great charioteer, inquisitively started to ask the Sage named Dharmabhrita about it. [4-11-8]"
3-11-8,"On hearing this greatly amazing music from lake, oh, great saint, intensive inquisitiveness is created in all of us, why this, please tell us clearly about it. Thus Rama asked. [4-11-9]"
3-11-9,"Thus said by that Raghava then that virtuous sage quickly started to tell about the efficacy of that lake. [4-11-10]"
3-11-10,"Oh, Rama, this is an all-time lake built by the ascetic power of the sage Mandakarni, known as Five Apsara Lake. [4-11-11]"
3-11-11,"He that great saint Mandakarni practiced rigorous ascesis for ten thousand years staying in the waters of the lake, and consuming air alone. [4-11-12]"
3-11-12,"Then all the gods are worried and met together with Fire-god at the helm of affairs, and they all conversed among themselves. [4-11-13]"
3-11-13,"This sage is praying for someone&#39;s place among us, thus all of those heaven-dwellers are perturbed at heart. [4-11-14]"
3-11-14,"Then all gods assigned five important Apsara-s, the celestial courtesans, whose shine is like the sprint of the lightning, to effectuate hindrance in that sage&#39;s ascesis. [4-11-15]"
3-11-15,"Then those five celestial beauties have led that sage astray who discerned the nature of this and the other world, or good and bad, or the nature of Absolute-Soul and Body- bound Soul, towards the passional restraint by, as though to achieve god&#39;s task."
3-11-16,"Also thus, those five celestial apsara-s attained wifehood of that sage, and for them he built a house in there, concealed inside that lake. [4-11-17]"
3-11-17,"While those five celestial apsara-s are living in there, they are gratifying that sage according to his delight as youthfulness came upon that sage owing to his power of asceticism. [4-11-18]"
3-11-18,"These musical sounds we hear are emerging out as played on their instruments, mingled with the tinkling of their ornaments, and mixed with their delightful singing of melodies. So said sage Dharmabhrita to Rama. [4-11-19]"
3-11-19,"That highly renowned Raghava together with his brother acknowledged the sage Dharmabhrita&#39;s account, exclaiming it as amazing is this... [4-11-20]"
3-11-20,"While saying thus Raghava has seen a cluster of hermitages nearby, encircled with sacred grass, jute cloths, and even encompassed with Vedic solemness, and he entered that hermitage along with Seetha and Lakshmana. [4-11-21, 22a]"
3-11-21,"Rama happily stayed in that august cluster of hermitages duly venerated by those great saints for sometime, and then that expert in great missiles Rama went to the hermitages of those sages with whom he stayed earlier, for another round. [4-11-22, 23, 24a]"
3-11-22,"Rama stayed there for nearly ten months at some place, elsewhere for one year, at somewhere else for four months, and for five, and six months at elsewhere, even at somewhere else for more than a month, and for more than one and half months elsewhere. [4-11-24, 25, 26a]"
3-11-23,"While Raghava stayed comfortably taking delight in those hermitages of sages, indeed ten years have smoothly elapsed. [4-11-26b, 27a]"
3-11-24,"Thus that virtue-knowing glorious Rama on going around those hermitages along with Seetha indeed went to the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna again. [4-11-27b, 28a]"
3-11-25,"On coming at that hermitage that enemy destroyer is adored by sages, and he resided there for some time. [4-11-28b, 29a]"
3-11-26,"Then on one day while staying in that hermitage Rama submissively said this to that sage Suteekshna who is sitting nearby. [4-11-29b, 30a]"
3-11-27,"I have always heard through the narratives narrated by other sages that the godly and eminent sage Agastya is residing in this forest. [4-11-30b, 31a]"
3-11-28,"But due to the vastness of this forest I have not known that place, where is the pious hermitage of that astute sage? [4-11-31b, 32a]"
3-11-29,"I wish to approach that sage seeking that godly sage&#39;s graciousness, along with my brother and Seetha to venerate him. [4-11-32b, 33a]"
3-11-30,"Can I personally propitiate that supreme sage -- is my high ambition, and it is recurrent in my heart. So said Rama to Suteekshna. [4-11-33b, 34a]"
3-11-31,"Sage Suteekshna on hearing that particular request of that virtue-minded Rama is gladdened and said this to him. [4-11-34b, 35a]"
3-11-32,"Oh, Raghava, even I wished to say this to you, that you may approach Agastya along with Lakshmana and Seetha. [4-1-35b, 36a]"
3-11-33,"But providentially you alone raised this topic with me, Rama, I will tell you where that great sage Agastya is. [4-11-36b, 37a]"
3-11-34,"On your going four yojana-s from this hermitage, oh, dear Rama, there is the great and glorious hermitage of Agastya&#39;s brother on the southern side. [4-11-37b, c]"
3-11-35,"That hermitage is there on a plateau in a spectacular place of that forest which is adorned with many flowers and fruits, thickets of long pepper, and reechoed with the callings of various birds. [4-11-38]"
3-11-36,"There are diverse lakes that are receptacles for tranquil waters, that are teeming with swans and partridges, beautified with ruddy geese, and Rama staying there for a night you may proceed in the next morning. [4-11-39, 40a]"
3-11-37,"On going one yojana beyond, taking the southward course on the side of the forest clump you will find Agastya&#39;s hermitage. [4-11-40b, 41a]"
3-11-38,"Seetha and Lakshmana will enjoy those woodlands adorned with diverse pleasant trees, as the woodlands abounding with diverse trees will naturally be delightful, isn&#39;t it. [4-11-41b, 42]"
3-11-39,"If your mind is made up to see that great sage Agastya, oh, great ingenious Rama, resolve your thinking in going only today. So said Sage Suteekshna to Rama. [4-11-43]"
3-11-40,"On listening that which is said by the sage, Rama revered that sage along with his brother, and then he journeyed with Seetha and his follower Lakshmana aiming to reach Agastya. [4-11-44]"
3-11-41,"While viewing beautiful forests, cloud-like mountains, lakes, and rivers that are flowing following the pathways, Rama happily journeyed on the pathway indicated by sage Suteekshna, then he gladly spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. [4-11-45, 46]"
3-11-42,"Definitely this alone appears to be the hermitage of Sage Agastya&#39;s brother, one with great soul and pious deeds. [4-11-47]"
3-11-43,"As how thousands of trees are bowing under the weight of flowers and fruit on the pathway, thereby I perceive it to be the hermitage of Agastya&#39;s bother. [4-11-48]"
3-11-44,"Upraised by the wind the sour-smell of pippali fruits is suddenly coming closer from the forest. [4-11-49]"
3-11-45,"Here and there visible are the well heaped heaps of firewood, and all over appearing is the sacred grass snipped at its top and gemlike in its tinge. [4-11-50]"
3-11-46,"From inside the hermitage in the midst of this forest the vertex of smoke from ritual fire is clearly visible as high as the vertex of a black rainy cloud. [4-11-51]"
3-11-47,"On performing bathing in sacred streams the Brahmans are making flower offerings to gods, called<font color=""#B3003A"">puSpa bali</font>, with the flowers that are personally collected by them. [4-11-52]"
3-11-48,"Thus by the words of Sage Suteekshna as I have heard, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this hermitage shall definitely be that of Sage Agastya&#39;s brother. [4-11-53]"
3-11-49,"Whose brother is Sage Agastya with meritorious deeds, who wishing well-being of the world controlled death by his efficacy, and who made this southern region a liveable region, this must be the hermitage of such a sage, such Agatya&#39;s brother. [4-11-54]"
3-11-50,"Once upon a time verily cruel demon brothers Vaataapi and Ilvala were here together, and they the dreadful demons, they say, used to be Bhraman-killers. [4-11-55]"
3-11-51,"Disguising in Bhraman&#39;s semblance and speaking sophisticatedly that Ilvala used to invite Brahmans for the purpose of obsequial ceremonies, where Brahman are fed after usual ceremony to appeases their manes. [4-11-56]"
3-11-52,"Then Ilvala used to make his brother Vaataapi into a ram, perfect that ram&#39;s meat into deliciously cooked food, and used to feed Brahmans according to obsequial rites and deeds. [4-11-57]"
3-11-53,"When those Brahmans are surfeited with that ram&#39;s meat, then Ilvala used to shout loudly, oh, Vaataapi, you may come out. [4-11-58]"
3-11-54,"Then on listening his brother&#39;s words Vaataapi used to lunge out bleating like a ram, tearing and rending the bodies of those Brahmans. [4-11-59]"
3-11-55,"This way they the guise changing demons always ruined thousands of Brahmans together, greedy for raw-flesh as they are. [4-11-60]"
3-11-56,"Then by Sage Agastya, whom gods have prayed to end this demonic menace, and whom demon Ilvala invited to feast during obsequial rites, he that Agastya having relished the fiendish demon in the form of ram, they say, had finished him off. [4-11-61]"
3-11-57,"Then Ilvala while giving lateral hand wash into the palms of Agastya entered in the routine conversation of obsequies asking, Is this rite fulfilled... and he furthered it in calling his brother to come out. [4-11-62]"
3-11-58,"Then that wise and eminent sage Agastya spoke mockingly to Ilvala who is conversing that way to his brother to come out. [4-11-63]"
3-11-59,"Where is the energy for that ram shaped demon brother of yours to come out as I digested and sent him to the hellish residence of Terminator. [4-11-64]"
3-11-60,"Then on hearing the words of sage Agastya affirming brother&#39;s demise, that night-walking demon furiously commenced to assault the sage. [4-11-65]"
3-11-61,"When that demon rushed towards that best Bhraman to kill, he that sage glowing with his own refulgence burnt him down just by his flame-like eyes and doomed him to death. [4-11-66]"
3-11-62,"This hermitage embellishing with lake and woods belongs to the brother of Sage Agastya who has done this impossible deed just by his compassion towards Brahmans. So said Rama to Lakshmana and Seetha about Agastya. [4-11-67]"
3-11-63,"While Rama narrated that way to Lakshmana sun went into dusk and the vesperal time came close of him. [4-11-68]"
3-11-64,"Worshipping sunset along with brother as per custom, Rama entered that hermitage and greeted that sage. [4-11-69]"
3-11-65,"Raghava spent one night there when that sage received him well and when they dined on tubers and fruits. [4-11-70]"
3-11-66,"Raghava spent that night there and when sun rose in solar orbit he took leave of the brother of Sage Agastya saying the following. [4-11-71]"
3-11-67,"Oh, godly sage, we stayed in the night comfortably, I now make an obeisance and bid farewell to you, as I wish to proceed to see your mentor and elder brother Agastya. [4-11-72]"
3-11-68,"When the brother of Agastya said, you may go, Rama the legatee of Raghu journeyed on the pathways as directed by Suteekshna, and on observing those woodlands. [4-11-73]"
3-11-69,"On observing the wild grass that grows on its own giving wild grain, Jack-fruit trees, sala trees, Ashoka trees, lemons trees, saplings of bilva trees and also madhuka and bilva trees he journeyed. [4-11-74]"
3-11-70,"Rama has seen hundreds of flowered forest trees that are battered by the trunks of elephants, that are adorned with monkeys, reverberated by hundreds of lusty bird folks, and that are enriched by the flowered climbers whorled around them. [4-11-75, 76]"
3-11-71,"Then the lotus-eyed Rama said this to his follower Lakshmana who is a valiant and glory-enriching one and who is near at hand. [4-11-77]"
3-11-72,"As to how the trees are appearing with velvety leaves, and as to how the animals and birds appear unwearied, thus gauging by this it appears that the hermitage of that contemplative soul Agastya is situated not very far from here. [4-11-78]"
3-11-73,"He who by his own deed is renowned in the world as Agastya, the stopper of mountain, it appears to be his hermitage that alleviates the weary of wearied ones. [4-11-79]"
3-11-74,"The forest nearby this hermitage is overrun by huge smoke from altars of fire, overstuffed with the garlands of jute cloth, overcrowded with the herds of peaceful deer, and also overloaded with sonority of the birds. [4-11-80]"
3-11-75,"He who impeding death by his yogic might and wishing well-being for worlds made this southern extent a liveable province by his pious deeds, his hermitage is this. [4-11-81]"
3-11-76,"Under whose influence the demons behold this southern quarter appallingly, and they do not even venture to live here, such a sage Agastya&#39;s hermitage is this. [4-11-82]"
3-11-77,"And from when that pious deeded Agastya took possession of this quarter, from then on the night walkers are calmed down and remained without feud. [4-11-83]"
3-11-78,"This very worthy southern quarter is known in the name of that godly saint Agastya and this remained unattackable to the demons with cruel deeds. [4-11-84]"
3-11-79,"Complying which sage&#39;s directive Mt. Vindhya ceased to heighten in order not to obstruct the path of the sun, such sage&#39;s hermitage is this who is renowned in the world by his deeds and whose longevity is inestimable, hence this glorious hermitage is adored by well-behaved animals and humans as well. [4-11-85, 86]"
3-11-80,"He that gentle sage who is always interested in the respect of sagacious ones is thus an esteemed one in the world, and for us when we approach him he accords beneficence. [4-11-87]"
3-11-81,"Oh, adept Lakshmana, I wish to worship that great saint Agastya therein that hermitage, and oh, gentle one, I think of living the remainder of forest living here only. [4-11-88]"
3-11-82,"There gods with gandharva-s, siddha-s, exalted sages will be worshipping Agastya who is self-regulating self-disciplinary. [4-11-89]"
3-11-83,"There no liar can live, nor a savage, nor even a deceiver, nor a man-torturer, nor one with sinful behaviour, for that sage is of that nature. [4-11-90]"
3-11-84,"There the gods, celestials, reptiles, birds live together wishing to worship the Absolute with self-discipline. [4-11-91]"

3-11-87,"We arrived at the threshold of the hermitage, oh, Soumitri, you enter firstly and submit to Sage Agastya about my arrival at this place along with Seetha. [4-11-94]"
3-12-1,"On entering the hermitage Lakshmana, the younger brother of Raghava, reached Agastya&#39;s disciple and spoke this sentence to him. [3-12-1]"
3-12-2,"A king named Dasharatha was there, his eldest son and the dynamic one, Rama has arrived along with his wife Seetha to see the sage. [3-12-2]"

3-12-5,"On hearing that sentence of Lakshmana that disciple who is ascetically rich replied &#39;agreed, &#39; and he entered the sanctum of Ritual-fire to submit the same to Agastya. [3-12-5]"
3-12-6,"He that agreeable disciple of sage quickly approached the irrefutable sage by his asceticism, made palm-fold and said this to the eminent sage about about the arrival of Rama, exactly as said by Lakshmana. [3-12-6, 7a]"

3-12-10,"My heart is indeed yearning for his arrival, and after this long a time Rama providentially came to see me. [3-12-10b, 11a]"
3-12-11,"Go forth and make welcome to Rama, Lakshmana and to Seetha, and they be entered here, why you have not invited them as yet? [3-12-11b, 12a]"
3-12-12,"Thus said by the great-souled sage and the knower of virtue, the disciple adored him with palm-fold saying that as you say. [3-12-12b, 13a]"
3-12-13,"Then that disciple went out with a little perplexity and said this to Lakshmana, Where is this Rama? He may come to see the sage and let him enter hermitage on his own. Said that disciple to Lakshmana. [3-12-13b, 14a]"
3-12-14,"Then on going out to the exterior of that hermitage along with that disciple, Lakshmana has shown him Rama and Janaka&#39;s daughter Seetha. [3-12-14b, 15a]"
3-12-15,"While that disciple repeated the obliging words of Agastya entered that reception-worthy Rama into hermitage on receiving him well. [3-12-15b, 16a]"
3-12-16,"And then Rama entered the hermitage with Seetha and Lakshmana looking over it which is overspread with docile deer. [ 3-12-16b, 17a]"

3-12-19,"On seeing the brilliantly glowing sage among those sages, he that bold Rama said this sentence to Lakshmana, the fortifier of fortune, Here comes the godly sage, Lakshmana, by his eminence I comprehend him as a depository of all ascesis. [3-12-22b, 23]"
3-12-20,"That dexterous Rama on saying about that sun-like radiant sage Agastya, he that descendent of Raghu fell on the feet of Agastya touching them reverentially. [3-12-24]"
3-12-21,"Then he who is a delight to the on lookers that noble-hearted Rama on revering the sage along with Lakshmana and Seetha, the princess from Videha, stood aside with his palms adjoined. [3-12-25]"
3-12-22,"Offering seat and water that sage received Rama, and even on exchanging pleasantries that sage said to him, please be seated. [3-12-26]"
3-12-23,"Having completed his personal worship to Fire-god, and having offered water and other formalities to guest, that sage gave viands to guests according to his hermitic observances. [3-12-27]"
3-12-24,"Then that eminent and shrewd sage Agastya in righteousness took his seat at the outset, and spoke to prudent Rama of righteousness itself, and who by now is sitting with his palms adjoined. [3-12-28]"
3-12-25,"Worshipping the fire, giving water and worshipping the guest a hermit should receive a guest and feed him, and if a hermit practices contrarily, oh, Rama, he is destined to eat his own flesh like a false deponent in other world say, hell. [3-12-29]"
3-12-26,"You are the king of all the world, the treader in the path of righteousness, great charioteer of probity, and you are the venerable and estimable one, and you have arrived as my dear guest. [3-12-30]"
3-12-27,"Saying thus, Agastya adored Raghava well with fruits, tubers, flowers and others according to his ardency, and then he said this to Rama. [3-12-31]"
3-12-28,"This sacred bow that is decorated with gold and diamonds is crafted by the divine architect Vishvakarma pertains to Vishnu, and these unwasteful arrows equalling sun in their blaze are the gift of Brahma. [3-12-32, 33a]"
3-12-29,"Also these two inexhaustible quivers packed with arrows that have the blaze of Ritual-fire, and this sword decorated in gold together with its sheath made up of excellent golden are once given to me by Indra. [3-12-33b, 34]"
3-12-30,"By this bow, oh, Rama, once Vishnu eliminated horrible demons in war and brought back radiant prosperity to the celestials. [3-12-35]"
3-12-31,"The bow, these two quivers, arrows, and the sword, oh, Rama, the endower of grace, receive and wield them to triumph over the demons as Indra would wield Thunderbolt. [3-12-36]"
3-12-32,"On saying thus that great resplendent and godly sage Agastya, gave all of those best weapons to Rama, and again spoke to Rama [3-12-37]"
3-13-1," I am delighted Rama, safe you be, oh Lakshmana, well-contended I am for you havecome to pay respects to me along with Seetha. [3-13-1]"
3-13-2,"The well-worn trail of yours on pathway is strenuousness and painful for you two,and it is evident from the sweat above your necks, even much more for Janaka's daughter, Maithili.[3-13-2]"
3-13-3,"She is delicate and not discomforted by such distresses earlier, yet motivated byher friendship she came to these highly detrimental forests. [3-13-3]"
3-13-4,"<em>""In which way Seetha takes delight in these forests, Rama, that you may ensureto her, for she has done an impossible deed in following you to forests, an impossible deed forwomenfolk, in general. [3-13-4]</em>"

3-13-8,"Where you wish to put up along with Lakshmana and with this Seetha, oh,enemy-destroyer Rama, that province shall be glorified. So said Sage Agastya to Rama.""[3-13-8]"
3-13-9,"Thus said by the sage, Raghava spoke amiable this sentence adjoining his palms tothe sage who is glowing like a ritual-fire. [3-13-9]"
3-13-10,"I am privileged and blessed as my mentor and the eminent age is well pleased withthe virtues of my brother and wife which are non-dissimilar to mine. [3-13-10]"
3-13-11,"<em>""But a place with water and many forests may please be shown, where I can residehappily and self-composedly on erecting a hermitage."" Thus Rama asked the Sage Agastya.[3-13-11]</em>"
3-13-12,"Then that eminent sage Agastya on contemplating a while about what Rama has said,that virtuous and confident sage spoke more ideational word to Rama. [3-13-12]"
3-13-13,"A most prosperous place called Panchavati is there at a distance of two yojana-sfrom here, oh, dear Rama, which is abundant with tubers, fruits, water, and many deer. ThusAgastya started to tell. [3-13-13]"

3-13-16,"I am in the know of your heartfelt certitude by my ascesis, thereby I wish toadvise you to go to Panchavati, though I said that you may dwell in these ascetic-woods along withme. [3-13-16, 17a]"
3-13-17,"That woodland will be delightful, isn't it Raghava, for it is praiseworthy and notvery far off from here, and Seetha can take delight in there. [3-13-17b, 18a]"
3-13-18,"There Maithili will take delight nearby River Godavari, and it is with abundanttubers, fruits, various are its bird flocks, and it is very reclusive too, oh, great dextrous Rama,further it is meritorious and appealing. [3-13-18b, 19]"
3-13-19,"Even you, Rama, with your good deportment are capable to safeguard the hermitswhile residing there. [3-13-20]"
3-13-20,"Oh, brave one, you see this great forest of flower-liquor trees, you have toproceed north of it and advance towards a banyan tree. [3-13-21]"
3-13-21,"Then on climbing up an upland a mountain is seen, that which is also not far away,and that renowned Panchavati is there in an ever-blooming forest in the valley of that mountain.Said Sage Agastya to Rama. [3-13-22]"
3-13-22,"When thus said by Sage Agastya, Rama along with Soumitri venerated and bade farewellto that truth advocator sage Agastya. [3-13-23]"
3-13-23,"Thus well bidden by Sage Agastya those two Rama and Lakshmana have offered theirvenerations at the feet of that sage and proceeded to their prospective hermitage at Panchavatialong with Seetha. [3-12-24]"
3-13-24,"Those princes that are dauntless in war took up their bows and braced up theirquivers, and resolutely proceeded to Panchavati on the route apprised by that great sage Agastya.[3-13-25]"
3-14-1,"Then while proceeding to Panchavati that Rahu&#39;s descendent came across a mammoth eagle with marvellous might in midway. [3-14-1]"
3-14-2,"On seeing such an eagle in the forest those two highly privileged brothers Rama and Lakshmana questioned it asking, Who you are? presuming it to be a demon. [3-14-2]"
3-14-3,"But that eagle with sweet ad soft words spoke to them as though to please them, oh boy Rama know me as your father&#39;s friend. [3-14-3]"
3-14-4,"Accepting that bird as his father&#39;s friend Raghava revered it, and he that Rama then asked for that eagle&#39;s name and lineage. [3-14-4]"
3-14-5,"On hearing Rama&#39;s words that bird said about his ancestry and himself, and in doing so, that eagle also narrated the overall genesis of all beings. [3-14-5]"
3-14-6,"Once upon a time there were lords of people, oh dextrous Raghava, and you may listen all about them from the beginning, while I narrate [3-14-6]"
3-14-7,"Of them Kardama was there at first, and afterwards Sesha, and later Samshraya was there with many children and a vigorous one he was. Then Sthaanu, Mariichi, Atri, the great mighty one Kratu, Pulasthya, Angira, Pracheta and Pulah were there. And oh, Raghava, Daksha, Vivaswan were while the other name of Vivasvan is Arishtanemi, and lastly the great resplendent Kashyapa, was there as Prajapati. [3-14-9] [3-14-7]"

3-14-9,"Of them Kashyapa accepted eight slender-waisted daughters of Daksha Prajapati, namely Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kaalakaa and Taamra, Krodhavasha, also thus Manu and even Anala also as wives. [3-14-11, 12a]"
3-14-10,"Then Kashyapa is gladdened and said to those young wives, You all shall deliver sons similar to me and who can sustain the three worlds. [3-14-12b, 13a]"
3-14-11,"Oh, dextrous Rama, Aditi, Diti, Kaalakaa and Danu have agreed for that, but others became unheedful of Kashyapa&#39;s words. [3-14-13b, 14a]"
3-14-12,"Aditi gave birth to twelve Aditya-s, the Sun-gods, eight Vasu-s, the Terrestrials-gods, eleven Rudraa-s, the Fury-gods, and two Ashvinis, the medicine-gods, total thirty-three of them. [3-14-14b, 15a]"

3-14-17,"Dhritaraashtrii gave birth even to Chakravaaka water-birds, and Shukii gave birth to a daughter Nata, and Nata&#39;s daughter is Vinata. [3-14-20]"
3-14-18,"Oh, Rama, Krodhavasha gave birth to ten of her self-same daughters namely Mrigi, Mrigamanda, Hari, Bhadramanda, Maatangii, Sharduulii, Shweta, Surabhii, and like that to Surasa, who is embodied with all giftedness, and even to Kadruva. [3-14-21, 22]"

3-14-24,"Rohini gave birth to cows and other livestock, while Surasa gave birth to Naagaa-s, viz., many headed serpents, while Kadru gave birth to ordinary serpents. [3-124-28]"

3-14-27,"All the merited fruit-bearing trees are given birth by Anala, and now I will narrate about Vinata, the daughter&#39;s daughter of Shukii, and about Kadru, the sister of Surasa. [3-14-31]"

3-14-29,"Oh enemy-destroyer Rama, I took birth from that Aruna, the charioteer of Sun, and my elder brother Sampati too, hence know me as Jatayu, the son of Shyenii. [3-14-33]"
3-14-30,"Such as I am, I can be your helpmate at your residence if only you wish me to... oh, boy, this impassable forest is a beloved one to predators and demons, isn&#39;t it... as such I can take care of Seetha if you and Lakshmana go out... Thus Jatayu said to Rama. [3-14-34]"
3-14-31,"Raghava revered Jatayu in his turn by gladly hugging and stood by him with his head bent, and that kind-natured Rama is indeed regardful of the friendship of his father with Jatayu that is repeatedly said by Jatayu. [3-14-35]"
3-14-32,"He that Rama took the princess from Mithila Seetha, and proceeded to Panchavati along with that very mighty bird and Lakshmana, as though to incinerate enemies, like fire that burns down grasshoppers. [3-14-36]"
3-15-1,"Then on going to Panchavati which is full with many serpents and predators, Rama said to splendidly brilliant Lakshmana. [3-15-1]"
3-15-2,"We arrived at the place as indicated by the sage, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this region with its flowered forests is Panchavati. [3-15-2]"
3-15-3,"In which place we have to situate our hermitage for our liking, for that cast your sight all over the forest, and indeed you are an expert in such matters. [3-15-3]"
3-15-4,"In which place Vaidehi, likewise you and me too can take delight, where the woodland is scenic and the water is pleasurable, and where a water lake, ritual-firewood, flowers, and the sacred grass are available in proximity, oh, Lakshmana, such a place may be searched out. [3-15-4, 5]"
3-15-5,"When thus said by Rama, Lakshmana adjoined his palms and said this sentence to Rama in the presence of Seetha. [3-15-6]"
3-15-6,"I am but a dependent, as long as you are there, may it be for innumerable years, I am your adherent, Rama, therefore you yourself tell me to build hermitage in such and such delightful place. [3-15-7]"
3-15-7,"Rama is gladdened by those words of that great resplendent Lakshmana, and he selected a place that comprised of all the attributes. [3-15-8]"
3-15-8,"On taking Lakshmana&#39;s hand by his hand Rama paced that beautiful place intended for the construction of hermitage up and down and spoke to Soumitri this way. [3-15-9]"
3-15-9,"This is an evenly and propitious place surrounded with flowered trees and it is apt of you to erect hermitage here, traditionally. [3-15-10]"
3-15-10,"This pleasing lake is seen here adjacently, beaming forth with its lotuses that are similar to sun in resplendence, and that are scented fragrantly. [3-5-11]"
3-15-11,"This River Godavari is also seen from here, surrounded by blooming trees, spread over with swans, and beautified with kaarandava, and chakravaaka birds, as that contemplated soul sage Agastya had said. [3-15-12]"
3-15-12,"Those soaring mountains are appearing beautiful with many caves, surrounded by flowered trees, flurried by animal herds, sounded by peacocks, and they are neither far-off nor very nearby. [3-15-13, 14]"

[3-15-16, 17, 18]"
3-15-15,"This place is holy, this is delightful and this is with many animals and birds, hence Soumitri, let us reside here along with this bird Jatayu. Thus said Rama to Lakshmana. [3-15-19]"
3-15-16,"Thus said by Rama to that remover of foe&#39;s valour and one with very great might, namely Lakshmana, he briskly erected a hermitage for his brother. [3-15-20]"
3-15-17,"Lakshmana built a very spacious straw-cottage there levelling and raising the clay for raised floor of the cottage, strongly pillared with long bamboos, thereupon on those pillars excellent rafters are made, and the branches of Shamii trees are spread out, twined firmly with twines of jute strands, and with the cross-laid bamboos for thatching, and over that blades of Kusha grass and leaves of Kaasha are spread and well over-covered for the roof, and thus that very great mighty Lakshmana made that best and very spacious straw-cottage with a levelled surface for residence of Raghava in the interests of Raghava alone, and it resulted as a feast to the eye. [3-15-21, 22, 23]"
3-15-18,"On his going to River Godavari that noble Lakshmana bathed and on gathering lotuses and fruits he returned to the cottage. [3-15-24]"
3-15-19,"Then making flowery offerings and peace-invocations also procedural to <font color=""#B3003A"">gR^iha pravesha</font> , entering a new house,] started to show the constructed hermitage to Rama. [3-15-25]"
3-15-20,"On seeing the beautifully constructed hermitage along with Seetha, Rama is highly gladdened in respect that straw-cottage. [3-15-26]"
3-15-21,"Then Rama very highly gladdened Rama embraced Lakshmana tightly by both of his hands, and spoke these friendly words to him. [3-15-27]"
3-15-22,"Oh, masterful one, I am very happy about you for you have done a great deed, for that reason I am giving what I have to give to you a hugging. [3-5-28]"
3-15-23,"You are the knower of others feelings, knower of many skills, and the knower of what is right and honest, oh, Lakshmana, such as you are, being with you I deem that my virtue-souled father is not gone and forgotten. [3-15-29]"
3-15-24,"On saying thus to Lakshmana, Raghava, the enhancer of magnificence comfortably resided in that province which is with many a fruit. [3-15-30]"
3-15-25,"While Seetha and Lakshmana devoted themselves to that righteous Rama, he resided in Panchavati like a Divinity in heavenly world for sometime to come. [3-15-30]"
3-16-1,"Pleasant <em>hemantha R^itu</em> , pre-winter season has set in after the passage of <em>sharat R^itu</em>, post-rainy season at Panchavati where the noble souled Rama is staying comfortably. [4-16-1]"
3-16-2,"On some day when night faded into dawn Rama started for the delightful River Godavari for a bath. [4-16-2]"
3-16-3,"His valorous brother Saumitri following him humbly with a handy vessel, along with Seetha, spoke this to Rama. [4-16-3]"
3-16-4,"Adorned by which season the promising year will be bright, oh, pleasant conversationalist, and which season will also be pleasant to you, that hemanta season has set in. [4-16-4]"

3-16-7,"Amply fulfilled are the desires of the villagers with the affluence of milch cows and dairy, and the vanquishing kings are make moves for the purposes of their further vanquishes. [4-16-7]"
3-16-8,"While the sun is steadfastly attending the direction of Time-god Yama, namely southern horizon, the northern direction is not brilliant like a woman who lost the vermilion mark on her forehead. [4-16-8]"
3-16-9,"By their very nature Himalayas are the depositories of snow, and presently distanced from the sun they are very obviously snowy true to their name. [4-16-9]"
3-16-10,"By the way of touch the mid days are comfortable and in these days the daytime is very much comfortable for sauntering, thus the sun in daytimes is genial and ungenial are the shades and waters. [4-16-10]"

3-16-12,"Precluded is the reclining under open sky as the nights are led by the Pushya constellation, they will now be with brownish-grey fog and chilly, and prolonged are the lengths of nights whereby the three watches of night will be quickly slipping away."
3-16-13,"Transgressed is the destiny of moon by the sun as moon lost the chance of keeping people happy with his lustrousness in these days, thus the lustreless moon remained in a blushing sphere with fog, just like a mirror blinded by the fog of a suspire. [4-16-13]"
3-16-14,"Even on a full moon day the moonlight is unbright blemished by mist, and it is appearing like brightly Seetha becoming swarthy by sun&#39;s heat, but not brightly. [4-16-14]"
3-16-15,"The western breeze by itself will be cool to touch, but presently charged with snow it is wafting doubly chilly in the early hours. [4-16-15]"
3-16-16,"Covered with the dew the forests that already covered with crop fields of barley and wheat are beaming forth, together with the callings of waterfowls, at the rise of the sun. [4-16-16]"
3-16-17,"The paddy crops in fields are gleaming forth with golden lustre, and their heads full with grain and a little bent down are shapely like the flowers of date-fruit. [4-16-17]"
3-16-18,"Though he came up long back, and though his beams are spreading around, besieged by snowy mist the sun is appearing as moon. [4-16-18]"
3-16-19,"Inappreciable is the warmth of sun in the mornings, but comfortable for touch at noontimes, since the reddish but a little palish sunshine is radiating on earth. [4-16-19]"
3-16-20,"The pasturelands are a little moistened with the fall of dewdrops, but the fields of forest are enlivened by the radiance of tender sun&#39;s warmth. [4-16-20]"
3-16-21,"On easily touching very clear and cold water with its very broad trunk that intensely thirsty wild elephant is backing away its trunk for the water is that cold. [4-16-21]"
3-16-22,"These waterfowls that are sitting nearby are not entering into waters like cowards not entering battlefields. [4-16-22]"
3-16-23,"Subdued by snowy darkness, enclosed in misty gloom, and reft of flowers these forest ranges appear like those that are asleep. [4-16-23]"
3-16-24,"Now the rivers are imperceptible as their water is overspread with dewdrops, but their water-birds are perceptible only by their callings, thus making that river perceptible, and such rivers are now glistening with moist sandbanks and shores. [4-16-24]"
3-16-25,"Owing to the fall of snow, further owing to the softness and coldness of sun, the water deep down the wells is generally agreeable for drinking. [4-16-25]"
3-16-26,"Lotus lakes are left alone with stalks of lotuses as their petals are aged and withered, decrepit are the fibrils and carpels, thus impaired by cold they are ungracious in look. [4-16-26]"
3-16-27,"But during this time, oh, manly-tiger, ushered by anguish that virtue souled one Bharata must be practising ascesis in city with adoration to you. [4-16-27]"
3-16-28,"On forsaking kingdom and pride of becoming the king of Ayodhya as well, and varied and various pleasures too, he is in self-denial, and with his food regulated he sleeps on chilly surface of earth. [4-16-28]"
3-16-29,"Even he might always be getting up at this time of the day and proceeding to River Sarayu for a bath surrounded by ministers, definite is that. [4-16-29]"
3-16-30,"But how can he who is brought up in high comfort, a delicate one too, enter the cold-wet waters of River Sarayu, in these small hours. [4-16-30]"
3-16-31,"That lotus-petal eyed one with blue-black complexion is an imposing one with lion-like waist, being the noblest he is knower of dharma thus an advocate of truth, and thus intolerant of ignominy, and as a self-restrained one he talks dearly and sweetly, and he is dextrous and an enemy-destroyer, such as he is, that Bharata on forgoing all of his various pleasures he is devoted to you, as you alone are his adorable brother. [4-16-31, 32]"
3-16-32,"Even though you are in forests far away from him, he is following you in the practise of austerities, and such a brother of yours, that great-souled Bharata has refused ascent to heaven. [4-16-33]"
3-16-33,"  Humans do not derive father&#39;s attitude but they take of their mothers&#39; is the well-know maxim in the world, but Bharata rendered it otherwise. [4-16-34]"
3-16-34,"Whose husband is Dasharatha and whose son is gentle Bharata, how then can she, our mother Kaikeyi, is with this sort of cruel disposition, indeed  Thus Lakshmana spoke to Rama on their way to River Godavari. [4-16-35]"
3-16-35,"When that upright Lakshmana is speaking those words that way out of his fondness towards Rama, Raghava spoke to Lakshmana, intolerant of that slanderous talk about their mother. [4-16-36]"
3-16-36,"In any way, dear Lakshmana, you are not supposed to deplore another mother of ours, but you go on telling the topics of Bharata, the king of Ikshvaku-s. [4-16-37]"
3-16-37,"My mind is indeed set to dwell only in forest, and it is firmly avowed, but while yearning for Bharata&#39;s fellowship my fascination to reunite with him is recurring again. [4-16-38]"
3-16-38,"I reminisce his words well, that are genial, sweet, heartily, ambrosial and that will gladden the heart. [4-16-39]"
3-16-39,"When can I really reunite, oh, Lakshmana, with great-souled Bharata, valorous Shatrughna, and with you and Seetha. Thus said Rama to Lakshmana. [4-16-40]"
3-16-40,"Thus worrying that way while proceeding, there Rama reached River Godavari and performed bathing with his younger brother Lakshmana and along with Seetha. [4-16-41]"
3-16-41,"Then on offering water oblations to manes and gods that impeccant trinity extolled the rising sun and gods likewise. [4-16-42]"
3-16-42,"On taking bath in the river along with Seetha and Lakshmana, Rama shone forth like All-controlling god Rudra, who will be radiant on taking bath along with his consort Paarvati and with his follower Nandi, the Holy Bull. [4-16-43]"
3-16-43,"The portrayal of seasons in epics with all their delicacies is a disputed topic. Ramayana also deals much on these descriptions of seasons. Whether an epic avowed to reflect the Vedic import, as said at 1-4-6, <em>vedopabR^ihmaNaarthaaya</em> , and that which is pious and merited <em>puNyam vedaischa samamatam</em> at 1-1-98, should have accounts on seasons   is the question. For this is said that relating niceties of season time and again, is in perfect accord with Veda, for the season and time are subservient to all Veda-s as per the ancillary of Veda, the Astrology,<em>veda-anga : jyotiShya</em> . Veda-s themselves say that the year is the soul of the horse of Ashvameda.<em>uShaa vaa ashvasya medhasya shiraH | sa"
3-16-44,"Like this we find beautification of four seasons at four places, for e.g., <em>hemanta</em> spring is narrated in starting of Kishkindha. And <em>vasanta</em> post autumnal season is described in Kishkindha 43rd chapter, when Hanuma and others are in search for Seetha, and after their exit from the cave of Swayamprabha. <em>varSa</em> rainy season is portrayed in 28th chapter of Kishkindha. At every possible occasion, all the rituals, daily routines that are time oriented, do explain the importance of time than the importance of ritual or daily routine. It is said:<em>vedopabR^ihmaNaartham pravR^itte asmin granthe veda vihita karma apekShita kaala visheSha nirNaayakatvaat kaala saadhaaraNa lakShaNa pratipaadanam eva tat tat R^itu varNana vyaajena kR^itam iti dharmopayoga sambhavaat | -- saayam kaalaadi cihna pratipaadanam iti etat sarvam karma anuShTaana upayukta kaala j"
3-16-45,"Thus dharma is upheld in all these narratives about the season and time, which aspect is upheld by the commentators and they too comment lengthily whenever a season or time factor occurs."
3-17-1,"On taking bath Rama with Seetha and Soumitri, then went to his own hermitage from that bank of River Godavari. [3-17-1]"
3-17-2,"Nearing that hermitage Raghava along with Lakshmana performed early morning rituals and then reached the cottage. [3-17-2]"
3-17-3,"There Rama comfortably spent time while being adored by eminent sages when he is with them, and narrating many a narrative while sitting in hermitage along with Seetha and his brother Lakshmana, thus he shone forth like the moon when with Chitra constellation. [3-1-7-3, 4]"
3-17-4,"At one time when Rama is sitting in hermitage and heartily absorbed in telling narratives some demoness arrived at that place, fortuitously. [3-17-5]"
3-17-5,"She is but the sister of ten-faced demon Ravana, Shuurpanakha by her name and she has seen him on reaching the paradisiacal being like Rama. [3-17-6]"
3-17-6,"He whose face is radiant, arms lengthy, eyes large like lotus petals, stride like that of an elephant, wearing bunches of hair-tufts, delicate yet greatly vigorous, possessor of all kingly aspects, complexion deep-blue like blue lotus, similar to Love-god in brilliance and in simile to Indra, the demoness has seen such a Rama and became lovesick. [3-17-7, 8, 9a]"
3-17-7,"She that demoness who is facially unpleasant one with that pleasant faced one, pot bellied one with the slim-waisted one, wry-eyed one with the broad-eyed one, coppery-haired one with the neatly tressed one, ugly featured one with the charming featured one, brassy voiced one with the gentle voiced one, deplorably oldish one with the youngish one, crooked talker with the pleasant talker, ill-mannered one with the well-mannered one, uncouth one with couth, abominable one with amiable Rama spoke, besieged by Love-god. [3-17-9b, 11, 12a]"
3-17-8,"You are an ascetic yet with a wife, handling bow and arrows yet in the appearance of a sage  what for you have come to this province frequented by demons  it will be apt of you to tell the purpose of your coming here, in actuality  [3-17-12b, 13]"
3-17-9,"Thus asked by demoness Shuurpanakha that enemy-scorcher Rama started to inform all about it, straightforwardly. [3-17-14]"
3-17-10,"A king named Dasharatha was there with his godlike valour, I am his eldest son, and people hear of me by name Rama. [3-17-15]"
3-17-11,"He is Lakshmana by his name, my younger brother and a devoted follower of mine, and she is my wife, daughter of Videha&#39;s king, well-known as Seetha. [3-17-16]"
3-17-12,"Desiring to implement the probity in following father&#39;s orders and for the sake of establishing probity in living an ascetic&#39;s life I have come here to forests to dwell, as enjoined by the directives of the king and my father, and by my mother, as well. [3-17-17]"
3-17-13,"I too wish to know about you. Whose wife are you? What is your name? Or, whose daughter are you? By the way, you are with a most enthralling personality, and then you must be a demoness. [3-17-18]"
3-17-14,"What for you have come, either, you tell in actuality... Thus Rama asked her. On hearing the words of Rama she that demoness wetted with love said these words. [3-17-19]"
3-17-15,"I will tell you truth, Rama, nothing but truth, I am a guise-changing demoness named Shuurpanakha, and I will be freely moving in this forest in a solitary manner and unnerving all. [3-17-20, 21a]"
3-17-16,"My brother is valorous and mighty Ravana, the king of demons and the son of Vishravasa, if ever you have heard of him. [3-17-21b, 22a]"
3-17-17,"And the mighty Kumbhakarna who will always be in profound sleep is my brother, and the virtue-souled Vibheeshana too is my brother, but he does not behave like a demon, and two more bothers of mine are Khara and Duushana who are renowned for their bravery in war. [3-17-22b, 23"
3-17-18,"I can excel all of them by my bravery, oh, Rama, and on seeing you for the first time I had a notion that you being the choicest among men you alone are my husband, hence I neared you. [3-17-24]"
3-17-19,"I am endowed with such preponderances and I can operate with my independent might, as such you become my everlasting husband  by the way, what can you bring off with Seetha. [3-17-25]"
3-17-20,"Unlovely and unshapely is this one, such as she is, this Seetha is unworthy to be your wife, and I am the lone one worthy to be your wife, hence treat me as your wife. [3-17-26]"
3-17-21,"Shall I eat up this disfigured, dishonest, diabolical human female with a hallow stomach along with him, that brother of yours to make you free."
3-17-22,"Afterwards, you can lustily ramble about Dandaka forest along with me while enjoying yourself on various mountaintops in the sky and in forests on the earth. So Shuurpanakha said to Rama. [3-17-28]"
3-17-23,"When he is said that way Rama chuckled and that wordsmith started to reply her who eyes are besotted in lovesickness with this sentence. [3-17-29]"
3-18-1,"Rama then voicing clearly and softly spoke to her, whom the noose of lust has tethered down, with a smile preceding his words. [3-18-1]"
3-18-2,"Oh, honourable one, I am married and this is my dear wife, thus it will be distressing for your sort of females to live with a co-wife. [3-18-2]"
3-18-3,"He is my younger brother named Lakshmana, he is with a good conduct, good looking, a promising and valiant one, and he is without a wife. [3-18-3]"
3-18-4,"He is without a wife and in need of a wife  he is youthful, good-looking and he can become a fitly husband of yours, fit enough to your kind of features. [3-18-4]"
3-18-5,"You woo him, oh, board-eyed [bulged-eyed] one, this brother of mine as your husband like sunshine seeking the Mt. Meru, then oh, great-waisted [pot-bellied] one, you will be without a co-wife  So said Rama to that demoness. [3-18-5]"
3-18-6,"When Rama clearly told that way to that demoness dazed in lust, discarding Rama quickly then she spoke to Lakshmana. [3-18-6]"
3-18-7,"I with my best complexion will be your deserving wife meetly to you charm, you can happily take a jaunt all over Dandaka forest along with me. So Shuurpanakha ran after Lakshmana. [3-18-7]"
3-18-8,"Thus said by the demoness that meaningful sentence maker Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, then smiled and appropriately replied Shuurpanakha. [3-18-8]"
3-18-9,"How you wish to become a female servant, oh, [black] lotus-coloured one, by becoming the wife of a servant like me? I am just a vassal of my adorable brother. [3-18-9]"
3-18-10,"Oh, goggle eyed one, befitting to your complexion that is un-stainable further you better become the wife of my brother Rama who is abounding in means, and on becoming the younger wife of that adorable one, you too will achieve your means and thus you will be happy. [3-18-10]"
3-18-11,"On discarding her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolically deleterious old wife with a hallow stomach that Rama will adore you alone. [3-18-11]"
3-18-12,"Oh, best complexioned one with best waist, is there any wiseacre to simply discard your kind of best personality, indeed, in preference to human females? Lakshmana said so to Shuurpanakha. [3-18-12]"
3-18-13,"Thus said by Lakshmana that despicable one with slouching stomach Shuurpanakha presumed those words to be truthful, for she is equivocal of that equivoque. [3-18-13]"
3-18-14,"She who is fuddle by lust said to that unassailable enemy scorcher Rama who is sitting in the cottage along with Seetha. [3-18-14]"
3-18-15,"Tenacious of her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolical, hallow-stomached old wife of yours you are not regarding me high. [3-18-15]"
3-18-16,"Now I wish to eat up this human female right before your very eyes, and then I can blithely make merry along with you, without the botheration of a co-wife. Said Shuurpanakha to Rama. [3-18-16]"
3-18-17,"Speaking that way she that torch-eyed Shuurpanakha dashed towards the deer-eyed Seetha in high exasperation as a great meteor would dash towards Rohini, the brightest star in the sky. [3-18-17]"
3-18-18,"By that the great-energetic Rama took umbrage and checking her who is like the noose of death swooping down on Seetha said to Lakshmana. [3-18-18]"
3-18-19,"Punning in any way with the base and brutish is inapposite, oh, gentle Saumitri, mark note of Vaidehi, somehow surviving  [3-18-19]"
3-18-20,"She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this paunchy demoness  Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [3-18-20]"
3-18-21,"Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before the very eyes of Rama. [3-18-21]"
3-18-22,"On hewing off her ears and nose she that ghastly Shuurpanakha blared highly and discordantly, and very speedily fled into forest as she came. [3-18-22]"
3-18-23,"She that very ghastly demoness when defaced is wetted by blood and blared many a blare like a cloud in cloudburst. [3-18-23]"
3-18-24,"She that gruesome one in her appearance clasped herself and thunderously entered similarly gruesome forest while her blood fountained and profusely exuded. [3-18-24]"
3-18-25,"Then she who is deformed neared her brother Khara who possess violent vigour, who is abiding in Janasthaana and who is presently surrounded by his band of his hench-demons, and before him she that Shuurpanakha fell onto ground like a thunderbolt from the sky. [3-18-25]"
3-18-26,"Then that sister of Khara who is convulsed in the fluster of fear and her body wetted with blood reported to her brother Khara, all about Rama&#39;s arrival in forest with his wife and Lakshmana, and even about his misshaping her. [3-18-26]"
3-19-1,"On seeing her who fell before him in a misshapen and blood-soaked condition, demon Khara is all stewed up and asked her. [3-19-1]"
3-19-2,"Rise up, first tell me clearly putting away your flurry and fluster, who disfigured your form in this way. [3-19-2]"
3-19-3,"Who for sport is poking his fingertip at a venomously fanged black-cobra that has chanced in his close proximity but slouching down inoffensively. [3-19-3]"
3-19-4,"Who on harrowing you is now heedless about his gulping a deadly poison, or about his foolish bracing the noose of Time around his own neck. [3-19-4]"
3-19-5,"You are gifted with boldness and braveness, a whimsical rover, a guise changer by your wish, a coequal of Terminator, but to whom you have gone and by whom you are led into this kind of plight. [3-19-5]"
3-19-6,"Who is that kind of highly intrepid warper, either from gods, or from celestials or from high-souled sages who indeed rendered you shapeless. [3-19-6]"
3-19-7,"Indeed, I do not find anyone who causes displeasure to me in this world, even among divinities including the thousand eyed Indra, the controller of demon Paaka. [3-19-7]"
3-19-8,"Now, I will take away the lives of that miscreant with my arrows that are terminators of lives, as a swan would drink milk to dregs even if it is mingled in water, duly separating milk from water. [3-19-8]"
3-19-9,"Whose frothy blood is it that the earth wishes to quaff when I cut off his crucial organs by my arrows and drop him dead in a combat. [3-19-9]"
3-19-10,"Whose body is it from which birds pressing round gladly wish to wring flesh to pieces for eating when I slay him in war. [3-19-10]"
3-19-11,"Now, when I haul him easily on the ground in a battle that villain will be unredeemable either by gods, celestials, evil spirits, or by demons. [3-19-11]"
3-19-12,"It will be apt of you to gather your sensitivity slowly and tell me as to which miscreant attacked and worsted you in the forest. Thus Khara spoke to Shuurpanakha. [3-19-12]"
3-19-13,"On hearing this kind of words of her brother, especially who is rancorous, then Shuurpanakha spoke these words, tearfully. [3-19-13]"
3-19-14,"Those two are in adulthood, good-looking, gentle yet greatly mighty, eyes broad like lotuses, dressed in jute-cloths and deerskin, subsistent on fruits and tubers, composed, sagacious and celibate, and they are the sons of Dasharatha, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [3-19-14,15]"
3-19-15,"<em>taruNau ruupa sampannau</em> Though they scarred her on her nose and ears she did not loose her heart for them. This <em>taruNau ruupa sampannau</em> is in accordance with Rama&#39;s aspect which will be <em>sadaiva priya darshanaH</em> &#39;the same pleasant persona at any time&#39; as in Bala Kanda at 1-1-16, as said by Sage Narada to Valmiki. This is the same situation with Hanuma when Seetha asks him to indicate some aspects of Rama so as to believe Hanuma. There Hanuma starts with <em>raamaH kamala patra akshaH sarva sattva manoharaH - sundara 35-8.</em> &#39;Rama is lotus-petal eyed one&#39; Further people in sleep, intoxicated or infuriated conditions, will speak their heart <em>supramatta kupitaanaam bhaava j"
3-19-16,"This narration has threefold meaning. 1] Through the eyes of a lustful female; 2] To belittle Rama and Lakshmana&#39;s prowess only to extol Kara&#39;s pride; 3] To deride Khara&#39;s valour so that he gets incited to fight Rama and Lakshmana."
3-19-17,"<em>taruNau</em> &#39;came of age.&#39; <em>kanyaam varayate ruupam</em> Women&#39;s first criterion towards a man is age. But this wording is in <em>dwivacana</em> &#39;in duel number&#39; so it belongs to both Rama and Lakshmana. Then the question comes &#39;is she leaning towards both of them?&#39; Yes. She makes eyes at both. First she approached Rama, but he advised her to approach Lakshmana. Lakshmana in turn advises her to approach Rama, thus she got interest in both. This is as per <em>anyonya sadR^ishau viirau</em> &#39;those darers are similar to one another.&#39; Rama and Lakshmana may be different among themselves, but to the onlookers they appear as one reality. Further, she has hate-thinking for both of them also. She says that &#39;this situation occurred due to both of them&#39; as at 3-19-18. How can she fall after both at a time? She can, with &#39;either-or-single-or-both&#39; syndrome because she is a demoness, and unseen are such brothers with their glorious aspects, so far by her."
3-19-18,"<em>ruupa sampannau</em> &#39;their aspects are ravishing&#39; The syndrome is that <em>angaat angaat sambhavasi</em> &#39;offshoots derive parent&#39;s aspects.&#39; So Manmatha, the Love-God derived all his aspects from Vishnu. Then it is imaginable how much more that Vishnu might be in his lovely aspect. So Rama is with <em>niratishaya ruupa samR^iddhi</em> &#39;sublime features, endowed with&#39; that which can be borrowed even by Manmatha."
3-19-19,"<em>sukumaarau</em> &#39;delicate&#39; like flowers. Rama is said to equal a delicate flower. <em>asiita puSpa samkaasham</em> Rama&#39;s body itself is a flower that which can be cherished by all. Or <em>su</em> = excellent;<em>ku</em> =of earth; <em>maarau</em> = Manmatha-s&#39; &#39;two Manmatha-s on earth&#39; Manmatha, is only one god of love and without any form or body parts, but these two are having excellent forms and are evident on earth before eyes as per the attribute of <em>kandarpa iva muurtimaan</em> &#39;he has a form like that of Love-god&#39;"
3-19-20,"Then her bother Khara may ask &#39;then why we demons shall hanker after some flimsy, fragile, feeble creatures?&#39; For that she says <em>mahaa balau</em> &#39;greatly vigorous.&#39; They have un-depleting vigour of manhood, which is what required by an aged demoness."
3-19-21,"<em>puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> &#39;white-lotus, broad, eyed&#39; &#39;Their eyes are not like ours while our eyes are <em>samrakta nayanaa ghoraa</em> &#39;bloodshot eyes of terrible look&#39;"
3-19-22,"Or, unlike <em>tamo guNa udreka</em> &#39;ever persisting with stolid constituent of nature&#39; and unlike<em>rajo guNodreka</em> &#39;ever energetic with sprightly constituent of nature&#39; -- their eyes are <em>sattva guNa sampanna</em> &#39;serene with the pure constituent of nature&#39; Though Rama says that he <em>aatmaanaam maanuSyam manye</em> &#39;in my soul I consider I am human&#39; but as per <em>shruti</em> / scripture,<em>yathaakapyaasam puNDariikam evam akshiNii</em> &#39;though his outward aspect is hiding his real Being, his eyes are telling the truth of His supernal nature&#39;, hence Rama is other-worldly."
3-19-23,"Or his white broad eyes are comparable with <em>kshiira samudra</em> Milky-ocean, his abode, with its unfathomable depths, so is his heart."
3-19-24,"Or <em>mahaa balau puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> &#39;Great mighty and white broad eyed ones&#39; who by their great might annihilate vice and if the evildoer submits himself, their white eyes alone give salvation with a broad-mind. <em>sukumaarau puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> &#39;Manmatha-like, white, broad eyed&#39; "
3-19-25,"If it is said that these two are Love-gods on earth, then it may be asked &#39;where are the flowery arrows of that Love-god to these two?&#39; But the arrows of these earthly Love-gods are their eyes and glances. The lotus is but one among the five arrows of Manmatha. Even Seetha under her direly distressed situation in Lanka says that &#39;gods, celestials, great-souls et al are sanctified with the look of this lotus-petal eyed one&#39; <em>dhanyaa devaaH sa gandhavaaH siddhaaH ca paramarSyaH | mama pashyanti ye naadhama raamam raajiiva locanam || sundara 26-41.</em> This verse takes its place in <em>gayatri ramayaNa</em> as its 14th verse out of total 27 verses."
3-19-26,"Further they are excelling only by their nature but not by their dressings and outfits for they are just clad in <em>ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau</em> &#39;jute-cloths, deerskin wearers of&#39; Mahaakavi Kalidasa says in his <em>abhij"
3-19-27,"Should Khara ask in fear &#39;who is that great-mighty one who mutilated a sister of a great demon like me? Thereby my fear is growing about my own existence.&#39; Then Shuurpanakha&#39;s reply is like this, in order to remove Khara&#39;s fear of Rama:"
3-19-28,"<em>taruNau</em> &#39;youngsters, boys&#39; for his own father Dasharatha tells Vishvamitra that these are<em>uuna Sodasha varshau; na yuddha yogyatam asya apashyaami</em> in Bala Kanda. Shuurpanakha that way tells Khara &#39;brother Khara... these two Rama and Lakshmana are boyish you need not care them, &#39; Further<em>yauvane viSayaisiNaam</em> &#39;boys in young age bother more for enjoymentï -- they are bothered to enjoy life and are not yet fit for a war, so you can war with them&#39;"
3-19-29,"<em>ruupa sampannau</em> &#39;just by getups they are brilliant, but lack in courage to confront you&#39;<em>kanyaa kaamayet ruupam</em> &#39;girls cherish charming ones&#39; &#39;They fall after girls only with their charming aspects that are unworthy to withstand war, so you can war with them&#39;"
3-19-30,"<em>sukumaarau</em> &#39;delicate or fragile, or flimsy,&#39; because they are sons of some king, grown up in palace chambers, unlike us who grow in ravines; and they eat nonsensically delectable food, unlike us who happily eat raw-flesh. So, wherefrom they can tolerate your bloodshot glances, let alone your arrows...&#39;"
3-19-31,"<em>mahaa.abalu = mahaa + a + balau</em> &#39;very, without, strength; very weak fellows&#39;;"
3-19-32,"furthermore <em>mahaa abalau; mahatii rakshaNiiyaa abalaa yayostu</em> &#39;a lady, namely Seetha, is to be protected by them. She has become a string fastened around their necks. Then how do they, the sentinels of a woman, can fight you...&#39;"
3-19-33,"<em>puNDariika vishalaa akshau</em> &#39;paled, broadened, eyed&#39; &#39;Their eyes paled and wide-open awaiting the results of their scarring my nose and ears, and their eyes popped up in daze, then what can they do to you...&#39;"
3-19-34,"Then Khara may ask, it is good you have said that they are hapless etc., but they may now muster up some army and fight me back then what?&#39; "
3-19-35,"For this she says, <em>ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau</em> &#39;wearers of jute-cloths and deerskin&#39; And furthering her argument she says, &#39;how can they afford an army for they themselves have nothing special to wear. That too one of those items, namely the jute-cloth, is begged from a tree that is sessile, and the other, the deerskin, is begged from a deer, that is mobile. They themselves are shuttling in between mobile and sessile how can they confront you.&#39; "
3-19-36,"Further, this god, say this Rama, has no other special work or duty, except shuttling between mobile or sessile beings or matter, begging their produce, and beg them to recognise him."
3-19-37,"Her words also extol the capabilities of Rama and Lakshmana in warring and said to have addressed Khara this way in order to enhance his self-pride."
3-19-38,"<em>tarunau; yauvane vijigiisuNaam</em> &#39;youthful ones are interested in triumphs&#39; &#39;Because they are the seekers of triumphs, they will definitely triumph over you, you better do not go there and get defeated&#39;"

3-19-40,"If Khara asks, &#39;how can they fight me, such a mighty one?&#39; "
3-19-41,"For this she says, <em>sukumaarau</em> &#39;they are dextrous&#39; &#39;with their dexterity they easily eliminate you&#39;"
3-19-42,"<em>mahaa balau</em> &#39;greatly mighty&#39; &#39;Rama is mightily by his shoulder-strength&#39; and also by the use of <em>mahat shabda</em> his might is by his tenacity of mind and ideation to eliminate foes. Or <em>mahaa balau</em> &#39;greatly sturdy.&#39; Though he wars for a long his vigour does not deplete for he uses two <em>vidya-s: bala, atibala</em> &#39;by the twin principles taught by Vishvamitra his strength does not deplete."
3-19-43,"<em>puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> &#39;white-lotus, broad, eyed&#39; His broad white-lotus like eyes does neither contract in anger nor expand in exclamation, as usually happen to anyone who sees an object of interest with unnecessary widening of eyes <em>priiti visphaarita iikshaNam</em>"
3-19-44,"Next if it be asked &#39;are they ready for a fight&#39; for which she says &#39;they are already clad in <em>ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau</em> &#39;jute-cloth, deerskin, clad in&#39; They have tightened their girdle-cloths and are armoured in shield like deerskin. Further they also have arrows and knives with which I am scarred so better not to go there and get your throat slit like my nose and ears, for you are a shameless, incapable demon still sitting here as I go on narrating the incident like a story&#39;"
3-19-45,"Having all the aspects of kings they equal the kings of gandharva celestials, and I am ill-disposed to differentiate whether they two are gods or demons. [3-19-16]"
3-19-46," I have seen a curvaceous lady between those two, a ripely beauty, rich in comeliness, adorned with lots of ornaments. [3-19-17]"
3-19-47,"Owing to that woman I am led into this sort of situation, together by those two, as with an insecure female. [3-19-18]"
3-19-48,"Staying in the van of war I wish to drink the frothy blood of that guileful Seetha along with that of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, when they are killed in war. [3-19-19]"
3-19-49,"I shall drink her blood and also that of those two in war, this being my prime longing let it be fulfilled by you. Thus wailed Shuurpanakha before her brother Khara. [3-19-20]"
3-19-50,"While she is saying like that Khara vengefully summoned fourteen great mighty demons that are similar to the Terminator. [3-19-21]"
3-19-51,"Wielding weapons and wearing jute-cloths and deerskin two humans have got into ghastly forest of Dandaka along with a woman of age. Thus Khara is ordering the fourteen demons. [3-19-22]"
3-19-52,"You shall return to me only on killing those two and also that treacherous woman, and their blood this sister of mine will drink. [3-19-23]"
3-19-53,"Oh, demons, on going there swiftly stamp them out by you own vigour, thus let the fanciful hearty desire of my sister be achieved. [3-19-24]"
3-19-54,"On seeing your finishing those two brothers flatly in a war she this sister of mine will be gladdened, and then she drinks their blood in war, amusingly. [3-19-25]"
3-19-55,"In this way when Khara ordered those fourteen demons, they have gone to Panchavati along with Shuurpanakha like black-clouds glided by gales. [3-19-26]"
3-19-56,"But then, though the nightwalker wielding sharp arrows have become ineffectual to trounce Rama like the wild elephants which will become ineffectual to overcome the blazingly uprising wildfire. [3-19-27]"
3-19-57,"Maheshvara Tiirtha notes that God Shiva cursed Khara and pardoned saying that he will be released from curse by Rama of Dasharatha.<em>tasmaadyaH kruura ruupeNa dehena harataa amR^itam | viShNur daasharathir bhuutvaa mokShayiShyati suvrata |</em> In the <em>sheSa dharma</em> of Maha Bharata in the discourse between Bhiishma and Yudhistira it is said that sage Yajnavalkya has three sons. They are Chandrakanta, Mahaamedha and Vijaya. These three Brahmans became Khara, Duushana, and Trishira by the curse of Shiva. The first one Chandrakanta is Khara. And the disciples of the three Brahman scholars are fourteen and they also became Brahma-demons, who are now being sent. On listening Shuurpanakha Khara came to know that Vishnu arrived in the form of Rama and thus Khara wanted to get release from the curse by Rama, and hence firstly he sends the fourteen demon-disciples, and later he and his brother also follow the suit."
3-20-1,"Then on arriving at Raghava&#39;s hermitage that ghastly Shuurpanakha has shown the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, along with Seetha to the fourteen demons. [3-20-1]"
3-20-2,"They have seen the great-mighty Rama seated in the thatched cottage along with Seetha and Lakshmana attending to him. [3-20-2]"
3-20-3,"On seeing the arrival of the demons, and the demoness Shuurpanakha too, that magnificent Rama of Raghava dynasty said to the radiantly brilliant Lakshmana. [3-20-3]"
3-20-4,"Oh, Soumitri, briefly tarry at the close of Seetha as I wish to eliminate these demons who have trailed the path of that demoness to here. [3-20-4]"
3-20-5,"On hearing that word of Rama, then the nimble-souled Lakshmana honoured the word of Rama saying so be it. [3-20-5]"
3-20-6,"On taking up his awful bow that is decorated with gold Raghava stringed it with bowstring and even spoke the demons as a forewarning. [3-20-6]"
3-20-7,"We the sons of Dasharatha are brothers named Rama and Lakshmana, and we entered the impenetrable forests Dandaka along with Seetha. [3-20-7]"
3-20-8,"We the dispassionate subsist on fruits and tubers treading in the path of virtue, and we being the sages resident in Dandaka forest what for you outrage us. [3-20-8]"
3-20-9,"As assigned by the sages I chanced here with bow and arrows to decimate you evil-souled and unrighteous beings in a crucial clash. [3-20-9]"
3-20-10,"Stay there obligingly or you should not be able to return, else if you desire your lives, oh, nightwalkers, you may return now. [3-20-10]"
3-20-11,"On hearing that sentence of Rama they the fourteen ghoulish demons who are the slayers of Brahmans and handlers of spears have become highly infuriated, and they with their bloodshot eyes and with harsh words said these words to Rama, whose eyes are with blood streaks at their ends, and who also is a sweet talker, and whose valour is yet unseen by those fourteen demons. [3-20-11, 12]"
3-20-12,"Killed in conflict by us you alone will set your lives loose as an inciter of fury in our highly great souled lord Khara. [3-20-13]"
3-20-13,"Indeed, what capability you have as a lone one to stand against many of us in the forefront of war, and why tell again about your battling ability in a given battle. [3-20-14]"
3-20-14,"When we launch maces, spears and swords by our might you will forgo your lives, mettle, and even the bow now clasped in your hand. So said the demons to Rama. [3-20-15]"
3-20-15,"su mahaatmanaH oh, Supreme Person; bhartR^iH kharasya our lord, to Khara; krodham utpaadya anger, infusing; asmaabhiH hataH tvam praaNaan na haasyase eva by us, killed, you, Spirits, not, leaves, thus..."
3-20-16,"Oh! Supreme Person, we have come here because you incited anger in our lord Khara, and by us killed will you let go your lives, mettle and spirits? No. Never it will happen."
3-20-17,"The reason for not happening of that event is explained: raNa muurdhan in war&#39;s, van; ekasya te agrataH sthaatum lone one, you, before, to stand;bahuunaam asmaakam api many, we are, though; kaa shaktiH where is, capability for us"
3-20-18,"Though you are a lone being, and we are many, where is the capability for us to stand before you in the van of war?"
3-20-19,"Thus they say that they have come only at the behest of their lord but not to kill Rama. baahuH yuktaiH parighaiH shuula paTTisaiH upalakshitaanaam though equipped with our paraphernalia like maces, spears, swords etc., adhyaahaara: asmaakam our;praaNaan viiryam tyakshasi lives, vitality, we loose; ehi come... give us salvation."
3-20-20,"Though we are equipped with much paraphernalia like maces, spears, swords etc., we lose our lives and vitality at your hand, so come on, take them away, and accord salvation and release from our curse. It is better to die at your hand than returning to Khara and dying a merciless death at the hand of Khara."
3-20-21,"It may be remembered that these fourteen are the cursed Vedic-scholarly disciples of Chandrakanta, now in an accursed form namely Khara and other demons. Maheshvara Tiirtha."
3-20-22,"Thus saying that way clamorously they the fourteen demons, upraising their weapons they unhesitatingly rushed towards Rama alone, and they hurled lances towards that unconquerable Raghava. [3-20-16, 17a]"
3-20-23,"Rama in turn shredded all of those fourteen lances only with as many arrows that are adorned in gold. [3-20-17b, 18a]"
3-20-24,"Next that great resplendent Rama in high wrath took up fourteen iron bolt like arrows that are whetted on whetstone and equalling the sun in their dazzle. [3-20-18b, 19a]"
3-20-25,"Then Raghava took up his bow, arched it, and aiming at the targeted demons released arrows as Indra would release his Thunderbolts. [3-20-19b, 20a]"
3-20-26,"And by the force of their speed those arrows gored the chests of those demons, and then on coming out bedaubed with blood they swiftly penetrated into earth like snakes into snake pit. [3-20-20b, 21a]"
3-20-27,"Those arrows bursting their hearts they are blood bathed, mangled, and utterly dead, and like the uprooted trees they fell onto the ground. [3-20-21b, 22a]"
3-20-28,"On seeing the demons falling onto ground that demoness Shuurpanakha is convulsed in rage, and she with a blanched aspect returned to the near of Khara in an agonising manner like a creeper exuding resin on incision, and fell before him as before. [3-20-22b, 23]"
3-20-29,"Then she in the presence of her brother Khara discharged a great outcry, and with a bloodless face she spilled tears attuning the strains of a whiner. [3-20-24]"
3-20-30,"Shuurpanakha having seen the fall of demons quickly fled from Panchavati of Rama to trikanTaka, the capital of Khara, and she being the sister of Khara she reported to Khara all about the destruction of those demons, in its entirety. [3-20-25]"
3-21-1,"On seeing Shuurpanakha who came back only to wreck havoc on demonic race and again fell before him as before, Khara spoke this sentence to her in clear terms in all his fury. [3-21-1]"
3-21-2,"What for your are howling again when I have just now commanded those fearless flesh eating demons in order to fulfill your wish? [3-21-2]"
3-21-3,"Those demons are my admirers, adherers and they always remained my well-wishers, hence there is no question of their non-accomplishment of my orders. [3-21-3]"
3-21-4,"Owing to what you are highly bawling by saying, &#39;haa, lord&#39; and wriggle on the ground like a snake? I would like to know the reason for all this, what is it? [3-21-4]"
3-21-5,"I am here to take care of you, then why should you really cry out like an uncared-for being, get up...get up, and ward off this sort of perplexity. Thus Khara said to Shuurpanakha. [3-21-5]"
3-21-6,"She that Shuurpanakha who is otherwise an unassuageable one is wholly pacified when Khara spoke to her thus that way, and she on dabbing her tearful eyes then spoke to her brother Khara. [3-21-6]"
3-21-7,"I came to you just a while back with my ears and nose chopped off and wet with gushes of blood, and you too have comforted me, isn&#39;t it. [3-21-7]"
3-21-8,"Oh, valiant brother, for my delight you too have sent fourteen demons to eliminate that atrocious Rama along with Lakshmana, isn&#39;t it? [3-21-8]"
3-21-9,"But they all who handled their spears and bolts along with an envious anger are killed in a fight with Rama by his arrows that cleave the crucial parts of his opponents. [3-21-9]"
3-21-10,"On seeing those highly impetuous demons falling to earth in a trice, and even on seeing the unusual deed of Rama in felling them, I am highly alarmed. [3-21-10]"
3-21-11,"Oh me! I am alarmed, fully frenzied, and even despaired, oh, nightwalker Khara, and beholding dread everywhere again I have come seeking your refuge. [3-21-11]"
3-21-12,"Why do not you rescue me when I am drowned in a vast ocean called grief, wherein each pervasive crocodile is despair and each swelling wave is fright. [3-21-12]"
3-21-13,"Besides, those flesh-eating demons that have followed me are also felled by Rama with his sharp arrows, for whom I have a contrite heart. [3-21-13]"
3-21-14,"If you have mercy on me, and even on those dead demons, and if ability and animation are still left in you to cope with Rama, oh, nightwalker, kill that Rama who is a thorn in the side of demons dwelling in Dandaka forest. [3-21-14, 15a]"
3-21-15,"If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, I will give up my life unhesitatingly, that too in your fore, that too now itself."
3-21-16,"If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, now itself I will give up my life than living a shameless life with these lopped ears and nose. [3-21-15b, 16a]"
3-21-17,"I can perceive instinctually that you are incapable of affronting Rama in a given crucial battle, even if your are with all your forces on the battlefield, and you assert yourself a valiant, but you are just vainglorious. [3-21-16b, 17]"
3-21-18,"Kill those two, Rama and Lakshmana, as they are just humans, or else, if you are incapable of doing so, really what for is your stay here in Janasthaana with your trivial stamina and trifling sinews like a stupid blemishing his clan, then get out of this Janasthaana at once along with your hench-demons. [3-21-18, 19]"
3-21-19,"You will completely and quickly evanish, indeed, subjugated by resplendence of Rama, for that Dasharatha&#39;s son Rama possess that kind of resplendence, in effect. [3-21-20]"
3-21-20,"And, by whom I am misshapen that brother of Rama too is a highly vigorous one... in this way on saying Shuurpanakha bawled variously in the presence of her brother, Khara, and then anguished by her own affliction that demoness with a cave like belly started hitting her paunch with both of her hands, and what is more, she swooned. [3-21-21, 22]"
3-22-1,"Thus when Shuurpanakha disparaged that valiant Khara amidst demons he is infuriated and spoke these highly hurtful words. [3-22-1]"
3-22-2,"This fury of mine originating from the disgrace brought on you is like the highly bitter salt water that is impossible to contain when ingested. [3-22-2]"
3-22-3,"I do not care the valour of that Rama for he is a human with dwindled lifetime, now going to give up his life slain by his own misdoings. [3-22-3]"
3-22-4,"Control your tears and cast off your despair too, for I will send Rama to the abode of the Terminator along with his brother. [3-22-4]"
3-22-5,"Now, you demoness, you will swill that Rama&#39;s red hot blood when that short-lived one is hewed down to earth with an axe. So Khara assured Shuurpanakha. [3-22-5]"
3-22-6,"On hearing the words plunged from the mouth of Khara she is very much gladdened and in all her stupidity she further praised her brother highly saying, you are the best among all the demons... [3-22-6]"
3-22-7,"Though she denounced him earlier she alone praised him now for which Khara is overjoyed, and then he ordered his army commander, namely Duushana. [3-22-7]"
3-22-8,"Those who are the followers of my will, whose hustle will be frightful and who will be unretreating in combats, such of those demons are there in fourteen thousand numbers, aren&#39;t they. [3-22-8]"
3-22-9,"And oh, gentle Duushana, those domineering demons are with dark-clouds like complexions, and they are the pamperers of genocide, as such, cause them for a belligerency, all at once. [3-22-9]"
3-22-10,"For me, oh, gentle one, promptly position my chariot before me along with bows and arrows, amazing swords and diverse sharp power bolts. [3-22-10]"
3-22-11,"Oh, war pert Duushana, I wish to start ahead of all the demons of ours, who are the clans-demons of the great souled Paulastya, for the purpose of elimination of that evil-minded Rama. So said Khara to Duushana. [3-22-11]"
3-22-12,"While Khara is saying thus Duushana heralded saying, Here comes the great chariot with sun&#39;s dazzle, yoked with very good horses of variegated colours. [3-22-12]"
3-22-13,"That chariot which has a roomy cabin with its rooftop like that of the ridge of Mt. Meru, body embellished in gold, wheels golden, gem-studded yoke-to-carriage shaft, all around encompassed with golden artefacts like fishes, flowers, trees, mountains, sun, moon, and auspicious birds flocks and stars, and even decorated with jingle-bells, endowed with flags, swords, and best horses, and such as it is, Khara embarked on it with all his rancour. [3-22-13, 14, 15]"
3-22-14,"On overseeing that great army with chariots, skins shields, weaponry and flags, and even at Duushana too, Khara charged all those demons saying proceed. [3-22-16]"
3-22-15,"Then that demonic force with their ghoulish skin shields, weaponry and flags, issued forth from Janasthaana, blaring blatantly and foraying dashingly. [3-22-17]"
3-22-16,"Wielding maces, dart-bolts, and spears, and also razor-sharp axes, swords and discs, and dreadful power-darts and power-bolts that are flashing, iron maces, unusual bows, clubs, scimitars and pounding-shafts, and even thunderbolt like weapons that are calamitous in look, that army which comprises fourteen thousand fiendish demons that are the followers of Khara&#39;s whim, has started from Janasthaana. [3-22-18, 19, 20]"
3-22-17,"On seeing the outrush of those demons of diabolic appearance, then Khara&#39;s chariot also proceeded a little later at their behind. [3-22-21]"
3-22-18,"Then the charioteer set spurs on those colourful horses that are adorned in polished gold according to the notions of Khara. [3-22-22]"
3-22-19,"When the chariot of enemy destroyer Khara is driven that impetuously, it has started to swell earth&#39;s four cardinal quarters and inter-quarters with turbulence. [3-22-23]"
3-22-20,"He whose voice is thunderous and whose rancour escalated speedily, and who is hastening forward like the Terminator intending to destroy his enemy, that Khara repeatedly hurried the charioteer shouting at him loudly like a overwhelming cloud that is going to storm stones. [3-22-24]"
3-23-1,"A massy and tumultuous ass-coloured cloud rained ill-omened bloody water while that fiendish force is advancing. [3-23-1]"
3-23-2,"The highly speedy horses paired to Khara&#39;s chariot have tottered in a trice, even though that place on the highway is with even surface and spread with flowers. [3-23-2]"
3-23-3,"Capturing the sun a blackish corona with blood-red outer circle has formed and nested around it like the fiery ring formed by circling a fireball. [3-23-3]"
3-23-4,"Then, nearing the golden shaft of the flag of the chariot with a very lofty flagstaff, an awful eagle with massive body occupied and perched atop of that golden shaft. [3-23-4]"
3-23-5,"Cacophonous and carnivorous predators and vultures took over the nearby places of Janasthaana and they made raucous sounds of many kinds. [3-23-5]"
3-23-6,"Turning towards the stretch scorched by the sun, fearsome and loud noised jackals have howled emitting awful sounds, that which is inauspicious to the demons. [3-23-6]"
3-23-7,"Then frightening clouds similar to bursting mountains carrying bloodlike water have rendered the firmament less of leeway. [3-23-7]"
3-23-8,"There chanced an abominable, cataclysmic, hair-raising darkness whereby the milieus or inter-milieus are not very clearly brightened. [3-23-8]"
3-23-9,"An untimely eventide glistened with a colour similar to the one drenched in blood, and then horrendous brutes and birds have clamoured facing Khara directly, and the vultures, jackals and eagles too have screamed portending danger. [3-23-9, 10a]"
3-23-10,"Jackals, that too female jackals, are always the agents of inauspiciousness in wars with demonstrable calamities brought forth by their portending howling, and such jackals have now howled in front of Khara&#39;s army with their snouts spewing blazes. [3-23-10]"
3-23-11,"A spherical object like that of a human trunk is revealed near at the sun, while the sun is rendered shineless as though Rahu, the great eclipsing-planet, has eclipsed him inopportunely, and the wind too whirled frantically. [3-23-11b, 12]"
3-23-12,"Stars sprang up with the brilliance of fireflies though it is not night, and at that moment fishes and waterfowls stood still in lakes, lotuses have dried up, flowers and fruits have dropped from trees as though it is night. [3-23-13, 14a]"
3-23-13,"Without any puffing of wind dust in brownish-red colour is heaved up, and there the songbirds like Maina started to twitter as &#39;cii cii kuu cii&#39;. [3-23-14b, 15a]"
3-23-14,"Meteors horrible in their look have fallen down thunderously, and even the earth together with its mountains, woods and forests quaked shakily. [3-23-15b, 16a]"
3-23-15,"He who is raving while sitting in his chariot that clever Khara&#39;s left shoulder thrilled excessively, and his voice too quavered. [3-23-16b, 17a]"
3-23-16,"While he is seeing everywhere his eyes spawned tears for no good reason, his forehead ached, but he did not retrace his steps owing to his own vanity. [3-23-17b, 18a]"
3-23-17,"On observing those worst auguries stemming up at that moment with hair-raising nature, Khara laughed them off and said this to all of the demons. [3-23-18b, 19a]"
3-23-18,"These awful auguries with their horrible nature have arisen, but owing to my own valour I am unbothered about all of them as with a mighty one unworried of the mightless. [3-23-19b, 20a]"
3-23-19,"With the excruciating arrows of mine I can hurtle stars from the face of sky, and if highly infuriated, I can even enjoin mortality to Death himself. [3-23-20b, 21a]"
3-23-20,"I am reluctant to return without killing that Rama, a haughty one by his might, together with his brother Lakshmana, with my incisive arrows. [3-23-21b, 22a]"
3-23-21,"In whose respect both Rama and Lakshmana behaved perversely, let that sister of mine be contented in drinking the blood of those two. [3-23-22b, 23a]"
3-23-22,"No defeat has chanced on me in combats at anytime and anywhere, that to you all is obvious and I tell no untruth. [3-23-23b, 24a]"
3-23-23,"If I am infuriated I can eliminate even the king of gods, wielder of Thunderbolt and a trekker on ruttish elephant Iravata, namely Indra in a war, then why talk about these two humans. Thus Khara addressed his troops. [3-23-24b, 25a]"
3-23-24,"On hearing that thundering speech of Khara that sizeable army of demons which is tied down by the noose of death obtained an incomparable rejoice. [3-23-25b, 26a]"
3-23-25,"Then desiring to see the war of Khara with Rama, great-souls like sages, gods, gandharva-s along with carana-s and siddha-s have come together in firmament. [3-23-26b, 27a]"
3-23-26,"On gathering at a place those great souls met one another and said, let good betide cows, Brahmans and those that are held respectful by the people at large. [3-23-27b, 28a]"
3-23-27,"Let Raghava triumph over these mighty night walkers from the lineage of Pulastya, as with Vishnu who once conquered all the mighty demons in war. So said celestials to one another. [3-23-28]"
3-23-28,"While the great sages are speaking about this and many other topics, they and the gods abiding in their aircrafts have inquisitively seen the flow of army of demons, whose longevity is now beyond hope. [3-23-29, 30]"
3-23-29,"Khara speedily bolted in his chariot to the van of his legions, and on seeing that demon Khara going in front other important demons too rushed to fore. They are Shyenagaami, Prithugviira, Yajnashatru, Vihamgama and also Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, Rudhiraaksha. These twelve highly valorous demons cruised in a semicircle around Khara. [3-23-31]"
3-23-30,"Likewsie Mahakapaala, Stuulaaksha, Pramaathii, Trishira are the four commanders of demonic forces and they followed Duushana marching at his behind. [3-23-33]"
3-23-31,"That army of valiant demons which is highly execrable, infernally speedy, and readily inspirited for a battle quickly rushed towards those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, as though a festoon of planets would rush towards the Moon and Sun so as to put them to rout. [3-23-34]"
3-24-1,"While fiercely valorous Khara proceeded towards Rama&#39;s hermitage, Rama along with his brother Lakshmana has indeed seen the very same auguries which have earlier appeared to Khara. [3-24-1]"
3-24-2,"On looking at those very gruesomely bad omens, and perceiving them to be unpropitious to people, Rama spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. [3-24-2]"
3-24-3,"Oh, dextrous Lakshmana, for the complete elimination of all the demons these great indications have arisen, as though betokening the annihilation of all beings. See them. [3-24-3]"
3-24-4,"On their part these clouds are hovering on the sky with stark reddish-grey tint, thunderously braying and copiously showering streams of blood. [3-24-4]"
3-24-5,"All my arrows too are incensed to fuming in an ecstasy towards a war, and dorsally gold-plated bows of mine are incessantly spurring to hook up those arrows, telling apart the impeding conflict. [3-24-5]"
3-24-6,"Judging by the kind of wild birds that are shrieking here, danger is up ahead and coming upon us, along with uncertainty of our lives. [3-24-6]"
3-24-7,"This right hand of mine is indicating by its repeated throbbing that a critical and riotous conflict is going to occur, no doubt, but oh brave one, our victory and defeat to the enemies are also in vicinity, and for sure, your face is also appearing brightish and aglow, which itself is a good omen. [3-24-8] [3-24-7, 8]"
3-24-8,"If the faces of those that are poised for a conflict loose lustre, deem that the death is looming large on their longevity too. [3-24-9]"
3-24-9,"This nasty noise which we hear pertains to the uproar of demons, and even to the drumming of war drums by the demons of fiendish activities, and this is ear-splitting. [3-24-10]"
3-24-10,"Preventive measures are to be effectuated for any imminent situation by any well-wishing person, or by a person with misgivings about a danger, or by a person of talent. [3-24-11]"
3-24-11,"Hence, wield your bow, keep arrows ready at hand, and taking Vaidehi with you seek shelter in a impassable cave of a mountain overgrown with trees. [3-24-12]"
3-24-12,"I wish you to gainsay me for this word of mine, my boy, have honour on my feet and be gone not before long. [3-24-13]"
3-24-13,"You are a stalwart, a forceful one, and for sure you can eliminate them all, it is doubtless, but I long to eliminate all of the nightwalkers, personally Rama said thus to Lakshmana. [3-24-14]"
3-24-14,"When Rama said to him that way, Lakshmana picked up his bow and arrows, and together with Seetha he took shelter in an unreachable cave. [3-24-15]"
3-24-15,"On Lakshmana&#39;s entering into cave along with Seetha, Rama said to himself, thank goodness, it is a good-idea! and thus saying he donned his shield. [3-24-16]"
3-24-16,"Well bedecked in a shield that has fire-like brilliance that Rama shone forth like a fumeless conflagration up-shot in utter darkness. [3-24-17]"
3-24-17,"On raising his imposing bow and drawing arrows, that valorous Rama firmed up and stood there, filling all the directions with the tinny sounds of bowstring. [3-24-18]"
3-24-18,"Gods with gandharva-s and great-souled siddha-s along with carana-s have then met one another and came there aspiring to see the war. [3-24-19]"
3-24-19,"The great-souled sages and those that are known in worlds as eminent Brahma-sages, on their coming together those beings of pious exploits spoke to one another, among themselves. [3-24-20]"
3-24-20,"Let good betide cows, Brahmans and those people that are abiding in all the worlds. Raghava shall be victorious in the war over the clansmen of Sage Paulastya, the nightwalkers. Thus they talked among themselves. [3-24-21]"
3-24-21,"Thus speaking they also well-said again, looking at each other the demons of fiendish deeds are fourteen thousand in number and this virtue-souled Rama is solitary... what would be the result of this war! Thus the sages discussed among themselves. [3-24-22b, 23]"
3-24-22,"Thus the assemblages of kingly-sages, siddha-s and the eminent Brahmans, along with gods that are staying in their aircrafts, tarried there in the firmament peering inquisitively at Rama. [3-24-24]"
3-24-23,"Immured in an aura of invincibility Rama is standing up to the war in its vanguard, and then on seeing at him all beings went into the throes of dread. [3-24-25]"
3-24-24,"That nonesuch aspect of Rama whose deeds are unharmful to any, has become the aspect of wrathful supreme-souled Rudra. [3-24-26]"
3-24-25,"While gods, gandharva-s, carana-s are conversing thus, then they have seen there the legions of the demons arriving from all over with boisterous noises, spouting cries of bravo, handling their grisly skins, shields, weaponry and war-flags, and onrushing at each other in disarray. With brassy twanging of bows, with the drumming of war drums, and even by their jumping, leaping and bouncing that area is filled with very loud and clamorous noise. [3-24-27, 28, 29]"
3-24-26,"When highly brutish cacophony of demons started to fill the forest, that jangling even panicked the brutes ranging in that forest, and those beasts dashed off to other places where silence prevailed, without looking back. [3-24-30, 31a]"
3-24-27,"And that foolhardy army of demons which in simile is like an unnavigable ocean steered towards Rama handling many assault weapons. [3-24-31b, 32a]"
3-24-28,"Casting his sight all-over even that war-expert Rama has seen that army of Khara lunging at a conflict. [3-24-32b, 33a]"
3-24-29,"Rama stretched his awesome bow to examine the taut of bowstring, and even whipped arrows out of quiver, and then adopted a mask of extreme wrath to eliminate all the demons. [3-24-33]"
3-24-30,"And when he is enraged and blazing he became frightful-looking like the blazing Fire at the end of era, and on seeing such a Rama when he is pervaded with conflagration like anger, the pastoral deities are very much annoyed. [3-24-34]"
3-24-31,"The all-pacific aspect of that Rama then in his exasperation appeared to be like that of the all-ruinous Rudra, the wielder of bow called Pinaki, namely peaceful Shiva when enraged, at the time of Rudra&#39;s embarking on to ruin the Vedic ritual of Daksha Prajaapati. [3-24-35]"
3-24-32,"That army of raw-flesh eaters with their bows, embellishments, and chariots, and also with their armours, all glittering with the dazzle of flaming fire, varied into a sky-blue coloured cluster of clouds on which the dazzling sunrays will be glittering at the dawning of the sun. [3-24-36]"
3-25-1,"There are fourteen thousand demons against one Rama, and the Divine beings watch this from heavens as a sport, without according any miraculous powers to Rama, suggesting that a human has to face any number of problems, here fourteen thousand demons, for himself and no divine grace suddenly comes to his help."
3-25-2,"Rama gives the demons enough time and warning, but as the atrocity is escalating, he uses one gandharva missile and many other arrows, which will devastate the entire army of Dushana&#39;s brute force."
3-25-3,"Khara on arriving at the hermitage along with forerunning soldiers saw the enemy-eliminator and wrathful Rama holding fast to his bow. [3-25-1]"
3-25-4,"On seeing Rama that bawling Khara raised his string-taut bow that makes an ass-like braying twang, drove his charioteer crazy saying, drive to the fore of that Rama... [3-25-2]"
3-25-5,"On the orders of Khara the charioteer drove the horses to there where the mighty armed Rama is standing single-handedly while swaying his bow. [3-25-3]"
3-25-6,"On seeing Khara descending on Rama then all those nightwalkers who are the deputies of Khara encircled Khara venting out loud battle cries. [3-25-4]"
3-25-7,"Khara staying on his chariot in the thick of those demons appeared to be like coppery-red planet Mars up-shot in the thick of stars. [3-25-5]"
3-25-8,"In his proneness to war then Khara assaulted that uniquely forceful Rama with a thousand arrows and blared a roaring battle cry. [3-25-6]"
3-25-9,"All of those infuriated nightwalkers then incessantly rained diverse weapons on that invincibleRama who is handling a horrific bow. [3-25-7]"
3-25-10,"Those demons that are already caught up with rancour bombarded Rama with bludgeons, lances, tridents, darts and hatchets. [3-25-8]"
3-25-11,"Those massive bodied and exceptionally mighty demons came jostling like immense clouds in their eagerness to kill Rama in that war, while some mounted on chariots and horsebacks, and some more riding mountain-ridges like elephants rushed in on Rama. [3-25-9,10a]"
3-25-12,"And those bands of demons have outpoured arrows on Rama, as with enormous black-clouds disemboguing torrents on a lofty mountain. [3-25-10b, 11a]"
3-25-13,"When hemmed in with those grisly-looking demons Rama appeared like Rudra surrounded by his divine retinue called <font color=""#B3003A"">prathama gaNa</font>-s, on certain days, whereupon he starts his all-destructive cosmic-dance. [3-25-11b, 12a]"
3-25-14,"That Raghava has pre-empted those arrows discharged by the demons with his excruciatingly pointed arrows as an ocean would do with the river&#39;s onrush. [3-25-12b, 13a]"
3-25-15,"Even if his body is gashed with those gruesome assault weapons Rama is not enfeebled, as with the enormous Mt. Meru that can withstand even if battered by very many highly blazing thunderbolts of Indra. [3-25-13, 14a]"
3-25-16,"Bruised and bedaubed with blood on all his limbs that Rama of Raghu&#39;s dynasty took shape of the sun enshrouded by cloudscapes at eventide. [3-25-14b, 15a]"
3-25-17,"On seeing lone Rama beset by many demons, then the gods, celestials, saints and sublime-sages are dispirited. [3-25-15b, 16a]"
3-25-18,"But Rama on becoming highly infuriated curved his bow to a full circularity on stretching the bowstring up to his ear, and then jetted out trenchant arrows in hundreds. Why hundreds? He surged them in thousands. [3-25-16b, 17a]"
3-25-19,"In that war Rama sportily discharged eagle-feathered arrows adorned in gold which are unstoppable and intolerable, and which in simile are the leads of Time-god. [3-25-17b, 18a]"
3-25-20,"Those arrows that are playfully discharged on the army of enemy have grabbed the lives of demons like the tethers flung by the Time-god. [3-25-18b, 19a]"
3-25-21,"On impaling the bodies demons, the arrows swamped in blood have gone into welkin, where they are aglow with flares equalling inflamed flames. [3-25-19b, 20a]"
3-25-22,"Innumerable and highly frightening arrows fusilladed from the nimbus of the bow of Rama that resulted as the filchers of the lives of demons. [3-25-20b, 21a]"
3-25-23,"In that war, shooting now with hundreds, and now with thousands of such arrows, Rama shredded those many bows, pinnacles of war-flags, armours and the like. And even shred are the heads of demons, along with their ornamented arms and thighs similar to the trunks of elephants. [3-25-21b, 22]"
3-25-24,"With the arrows flung from the bow-bowstring-nimbus of Rama, he indeed shredded and scraped the horses hitched with golden harnesses, and the chariots to which they are yoked, and even their charioteers. Likewise, he even ripped off the elephants along with their riders, and the horses along with their cavaliers. And on eliminating infantrymen in that war Rama led them to the abode of Yama, the Time-god. [3-25-23, 24] [3-25-23]"
3-25-25,"While ripped to pieces with tubular arrows, with arrows made of iron, and with sharp-edged and crescent-tipped arrows those demons have let out disgusting cries of anguish. [3-25-25]"
3-25-26,"When those arrows that gore the critical parts are thus harrowing, that army is discomposed like a forest burnt to a cinder by wild-fire. [3-25-26]"
3-25-27,"Some of the grotesquely sinewy and braving nightwalkers are highly enraged and dashed their darts, tridents, and hatchets towards Rama. [3-25-27]"
3-25-28,"On fending off those weapons with his arrows that mighty armed and valorous Rama filched away their lives by shearing off their necks in that war. [3-25-28]"
3-25-29,"Those demons crashed down to earth with their heads severed and shields and bows wrecked, like the trees strewn around on earth owing to the gust raised by Garuda, the Divine Eagle, when he takes a sudden flight in heavens. [3-25-29]"
3-25-30,"Those nightwalkers that are battered by those arrows and remaining there, they desperately rushed towards Khara alone seeking shelter. [3-25-30]"
3-25-31,"Comforting all of them and taking his bow, very highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards that infuriated Rama like the furious Eliminator Yama."
3-25-32,"That highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards Rama as highly infuriated Yama rushes towards Rudra, where Rudra being the ultimate eliminator himself, angry rush of Yama towards Rudra is therefore futile. [3-25-31]"
3-25-33,"Coming under the shelter of Duushana all of those demons are but emboldened and returned, and they once again rushed towards Rama with saala trees, palm trees and boulders as their weapons. [3-25-32]"
3-25-34,"Handling tridents, maces, and leashes those great-mighty demons have created torrents of arrows, missiles, trees and boulders, and inundated Rama in that war. [3-25-33, 34a]"
3-25-35,"Again there chanced a highly gruesome war between Rama and those demons that is tumultuous, stunning, and a hair-raising. [3-25-34b, 35a]"
3-25-36,"Those demons have resurfaced from all around pressurising Raghava in high dudgeon. On seeing the reappearance of demons from everywhere, with whom all the directions and inter-directions are fully filled, and who are storming torrents of arrows, then that exceptionally forceful Rama made a thunderous sound and launched an extremely blazing missile among the gather of demons, called gandharva missile. [3-25-35b, 36, 37]"
3-25-37,"Then from the nimbus of his bow, arrows in thousand have scurried out, and with them thus arrived all the ten sides are cramped up. [3-25-38]"
3-25-38,"Either the drawing of those supreme arrows from the quiver, or the traction of bowstring on placing them, or unloosing them from the bow is unperceived by those demons that are harrowing under those arrows. [3-25-39]"
3-25-39,"Darkness caused by the thick of the arrows overspread the sky including its sun, while Rama happened to persevere spewing forth his arrows. [3-25-40]"
3-25-40,"Far and wide the earth is scattered with herds that are falling instantaneously, hosts that have fallen instantly, and huddles that are already felled with an instantaneity. [3-25-41]"
3-25-41,"Thousands of demons are noticeable hither and yon, killed, fallen and enfeebled, and slashed, gashed and ripped. [3-25-42]"
3-25-42,"Some severed heads still have their headgears and some bare, some arms are with armlets and some bare, while some with their arms cut off, some with their thighs cut off, some with their divers patterns of ornaments on their bodies have fallen on ground. Numerous horses and elephants are felled. Chariots, royal-fans, royal-parasols, war-flags of very many kinds are ravaged in many ways. Hit down by Rama&#39;s arrows spears and tridents are variously splintered, swords broken to pieces, darts and hatchets shattered and strewn around. Also the boulders are pulverised, various amazing arrows have gone to rack and ruin in many ways. Spread with such wreckage the earth has become horrifying for a glance. [3-25-43, 44, 45, 46]"
3-25-43,"On seeing the killed demons all the surviving demons have become enervated and they are rendered incapable to make a move towards Rama, the conqueror of enemy&#39;s capitals. [3-25-47]"
3-26-1,"On seeing the shattering of his own forces, Duushana bid five thousand mighty-armed nightwalkers of monstrous impetus, and who knew no retreat in war, to attack Rama. [3-26-1]"
3-26-2,"And they with spears, scimitars, swords, and with the rains of boulders, trees and arrows rained incessantly and inordinately upon Rama from all over. [3-26-2b, 3a]"
3-26-3,"Raghava, the virtue-souled, in his turn has neutralised that ghastly and life-taking storm of boulders and trees with his fierce arrows. [3-26-3b, 4a]"
3-26-4,"Like a bull receiving rain with closed eyes Rama assimilated that storming and then evoked an inordinate infuriation for eliminating all of the demons. [3-26-4b, 5a]"
3-26-5,"Exasperation prevailing on him who appeared to be highly blazing with the blaze of his own virtue, he then diffused Duushana and his army with arrows from all over. [3-26-5b, 6a]"
3-26-6,"And on becoming enraged Duushana, the railer of his rivals and the commander of that army, then virtually forestalled Raghava&#39;s onslaught with his arrows that are simulative of thunderbolts. [3-26-6b, 7a]"
3-26-7,"That valiant one in warring Rama is then infuriated and with his crescent-barbed arrow shivered the sturdy bow of Duushana, shredding four of his horses with four more arrows. [3-26-7b, 8a]"
3-26-8,"On destructing the horses with excruciating arrows, he even fragmented the head of the charioteer with a crescent-barbed arrow, and even impaled the chest of demon Duushana with some more arrows. [3-26-8b, 9a]"
3-26-9,"With his bow fractured and chariot shredded, and with horses and charioteer killed, he that Duushana grabbed a mace which outranks a peak of mountain and a hair-thriller at its sight, and which girt with golden girths once gritted the armies of gods, the head of which is studded with incisive iron spikes and saturated with the fat of foes, a coequal of a diamond and a thunderbolt in its hardiness and flashiness, and a ransacker of the archways of fortresses of his adversaries. [3-26-9b, 10, 11]"
3-26-10,"On firmly gripping that mace which in war is akin to an infernal serpent, and the touch of which tantamount to snakebite, rushed that nightwalker Duushana with infernal exerts rushed towards Rama. [3-26-12]"
3-26-11,"While Duushana came falling on, he that Raghava sheared off his shoulders that have wrist-ornaments on his arms with two arrows. [3-26-13]"
3-26-12,"When Duushana&#39;s arms are thus sheared in the van of war, his gigantic mace slipped and spun in his own front, like the flagstaff with flag raised in honour of Indra, and collapsed . [3-26-14]"
3-26-13,"With both of his arms strewn around Duushana fell down onto earth like a haughty and gigantic elephant when both of its tusks are broken down. [3-26-15]"
3-26-14,"On seeing Duushana eliminated and fallen to ground, all the beings have applauded Rama saying, &#39;good, good...&#39; [3-26-16]"
3-26-15,"In the meantime infuriated are the three leading commanders of that army, namely Mahakapaala, Sthulaaksha and great mighty Pramaathii, and they collectively ran towards Rama, bound by the rein of death. [3-26-17, 18a]"
3-26-16,"Mahakapaala raising a broad trident, Sthulaaksha handling a scimitar, Pramaathi handling an axe rushed towards Rama. [3-26-18b, 19a]"
3-26-17,"As one would receive guests meeting his basic needs, Raghava too took on these untimely guests of war, rather the insurgents, meeting their basic needs which now are no more than highly sharpened acute edged arrows, when he saw them coming and falling upon him, inopportunely. [3-26-19b, 20a]"
3-26-18,"Rama, the legatee of Raghu, chopped off the head of Mahakapaala, with incalculable spates of arrows he eliminated Pramaathi, and filled the bulging eyes of Sthulaaksha with arrows by which Sthulaaksha is killed and fell down onto ground like a burly tree with its broad branches. Then still infuriated Rama forthwith eliminated the five thousand hench-demons of Duushana with five thousand arrows, and thus he led them to the residence of Time-god, namely the hell. [3-26-20b, 21, 22, 23a]"
3-26-19,"On hearing about the killing of Duushana and also thus of the followers of Duushana, Khara irately ordered his army captains, under whose captaincy mighty forces are there. [3-26-23b, 24a]"
3-26-20,"Duushana is killed in war along with his followers, hence all you demons, take formidable army, take weapons of diverse designs, combat and kill that evil-human Rama... Thus Khara ordered the remaining demons. [3-26-24b, 25]"
3-26-21,"Saying so Khara himself rushed towards Rama in rage, and Shyenagaami, Prithugriiva, Yajnashatru, Vihangama Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, and Rudhiraaksha are the twelve fiendishly atrocious troop leaders of demonic forces, and they too rushed towards Rama launching their atrocious arrows. [3-26-26, 27, 28]"
3-26-22,"He who is resplendent that Rama then annihilated the remaining demons of that army with his arrows that are embellished with gold and diamonds, and that are blazing like ritual-fires. [3-26-29]"
3-26-23,"With those arrows that have golden tailpieces and sharp barbs, and that are dazzling like fuming ritual fires Rama felled the demons, as Thunderbolts of Indra will be felling gigantic trees. [3-26-30]"
3-26-24,"With a hundred rudder like arrows Rama hit down a hundred demons, and with a thousand more, thousand more demons are hit in the forefront of that war. [3-26-31]"
3-26-25,"Ripped are their shields and armorial-ornaments, ruined and rickety are their bows, and they the nightwalkers fell flat on ground, bodies wholly smudged with blood. [3-26-32]"
3-26-26,"With those demons that have fallen down in war, whose hair is tousled and who are drenched in blood, entire earth looked like a vast altar of fire overspread with holy grass. [3-26-33]"
3-26-27,"That forest which became sludgy with the flesh and blood of killed demons and very disgusting, in a moment it became identical with hell. [3-26-34]"
3-26-28,"Thus that Rama, a lone one, that too a foot-soldier, has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of frightening exploits. [3-26-35]"
3-26-29,"Of his entire army great-charioteer Khara and Trishira are the remaining nightwalkers, and Rama, the enemy destroyer, naturally on the other side. [3-26-36]"
3-26-30,"Lakshmana&#39;s elder brother Rama eliminated all of the remaining demons in the forefront of war who are highly valorous, ghastly and unbearable. [3-26-37]"
3-26-31,"Then on surveying that great demonic force which is eliminated by Rama in that staggering war, Khara then marched on to reach Rama in a huge chariot, as with Indra who will march upraising his Thunderbolt. [3-26-38]"
3-27-1,"But when Khara is about to lunge to the forefront of Rama, nearing him the commander of demonic forces named Trishira spoke this to him. [3-27-1]"
3-27-2,"Desisting from your personal adventure you enjoin me for I am an invader, and then you are certain to see me felling that mighty-armed Rama in combat. [3-27-2]"
3-27-3,"Taking oath on my weapon I promise to you that I truly wish to kill this Rama, as he deserves ill of all the demons by killing. [3-27-3]"
3-27-4,"Hold back your combative-adventurism and become an examiner to decide whether I am going to become his god of death in this combat, or he becomes mine. [3-27-4]"
3-27-5,"If I were to kill Rama you may gladly proceed to Janasthaana, else if Rama kills me then you can adventurously proceed against him for a combat. Thus Trishira spoke to Khara. [3-27-5]"
3-27-6,"By that death-greedy demon Trishira, Khara is manoeuvred and Khara to him said &#39;begone... combat...&#39; and thus permitted, Trishira proceeded to the forefront of Rama. [3-27-6]"
3-27-7,"Trishira with a lustrous chariot that is yoked with equally lustrous horses hurried towards Rama in that war, like a tri-peaked mountain, for they say, he is a tri-headed demon. [3-27-7]"
3-27-8,"Discharging hosts of arrow-torrents like a hefty-arrow-cloud, he readily discharged a noise similar to the thudding drumbeat when a water-wet war-drum is beaten, rather than a blast from a heated drum. [3-27-8]"
3-27-9,"On seeing the oncoming of that demon Trishira, Raghava welcomed him by speedily winnowing smarting arrows from his bow. [3-27-9]"
3-27-10,"That grave and tumultuous encounter chanced between Rama and Trishira is like the extremely forceful encounter between a loin and an elephant. [3-27-10]"
3-27-11,"Later when Trishira smote on the forehead of highly enraged Rama with three arrows, Rama&#39;s ire is intensified and he franticly said this to that demon. [3-27-11]"
3-27-12,"Oho! What an energy of a triumphing adventurer is this! A demon with this sort of energy is adventuring me, whose arrows rap my forehead peripherally, like flowers! [3-27-12]"
3-27-13,"Now you accept arrows plunging from the string of my bow... saying thus, that infuriated Rama with his alacritous swiftness hit the chest of Trishira with fourteen arrows similar to venomous snakes. [3-27-13, 14a]"
3-27-14,"With four of his straight shooting arrows that have hook-like barbs, that resplendent Rama hewed down four of the speedy horses of Trishira&#39;s chariot. [3-27-14b, 15a]"
3-27-15,"With eight arrows Rama felled the charioteer from his settle on the chariot, and with one arrow ripped off the high flying flag on that chariot. [3-27-15b, 16a]"
3-27-16,"When that nightwalker is vaulting from that smashed chariot Rama with his arrows tore his chest to shreds and he that Trishira became inert. [3-27-16b, 17a]"
3-27-17,"And with three sharp and rapid arrows, and even with his own exasperation, Rama of inestimable aptitude rolled the three heads that demon. [3-27-17b, 18a]"
3-27-18,"When that nightwalker is highly tortured with Rama&#39;s arrows he collapsed spewing blood with fumes, whereat he is standing in war, at where his three heads rolled just now. [3-27-18b, 19a]"
3-27-19,"As with the fleeing of deer alarmed by a tiger, the demons remaining after liquidation, whom Khara has protected so far and whose confidence is now shattered, are running away, and they gave Khara the run-around. [3-27-19b, 20a]"
3-27-20,"On seeing at those deserters Khara is piqued and quickly brought them back to his control, and then as with the scampering of eclipsing planet Rahu towards moon during lunar-eclipse, he scurried towards Rama alone. [3-27-20b, c]"
3-28-1,"Khara is intimidated on seeing the elimination of Duushana along with Trishira inasmuch as the intrepidity of Rama is concerned. [4-28-1]"
3-28-2,"On seeing the annihilation of the insufferable and mighty force of demons, even that of Duushana and Trishira by lone Rama, and thus to apprehend that the demonic force is wholly destructed, that demon Khara became apprehensive, and then he lunged at Rama, as with demon Namuchi who once lunged at Indra. [4-28-2, 3]"
3-28-3,"Forcefully drawing the bowstring fitted with iron-arrows, which looked like furious serpents of venom ingesting only blood, Khara discharged them on Rama. [4-28-4]"
3-28-4,"Fidgeting with bowstring in many a way, brandishing missiles with many a skill, Khara moved about the battleground in many a manner, seated on chariot and showing his expertise with arrows. [4-28-5]"
3-28-5,"That great chariot-fighter Khara then started to fill all the stretches and inter-stretches with arrows, seeing that even Rama reciprocally started to take aim with his bow Rama, and then filled and made the sky less of leeway with verily unendurable arrows that are like tongues of fire emitting sparks, as with Rain-god chocking the sky with torrents, less of latitude. [4-28-6, 7]"
3-28-6,"No empty space is left out in the space around since it has become riotous with the sharp arrows discharged by Rama and Khara from everywhere. [4-28-8]"
3-28-7,"While both of them are warring with excitement to slay one another, then the sun obscured with the mesh of arrows has not shined. [4-28-9]"
3-28-8,"Then with acutely edged tubular, iron, and crescent-edged arrows Khara swatted Rama in that combat, as a great elephant will be swatted with a goad. [4-28-10]"
3-28-9,"When charioted Khara came to the presence of Rama with bow in hand and ready for a close combat, that demon appeared to all beings as the Terminator handling his noose. [4-28-11]"
3-28-10,"Khara presumed that greatly indefatigable Rama is wholly fatigued by now, though he has shown his mettle of boldness in eliminating all of the demonic forces, all the while. [4-28-12]"
3-28-11,"On seeing Khara who is prancing like a lion with a gait of a lion, Rama is unruffled like a lion that sees a least beast. [4-28-13]"
3-28-12,"In a chariot that equals the sun in its radiance then Khara reached Rama as a moth reaches fire. [4-28-14]"
3-28-13,"Showing sleight of hand Khara then broke the handgrip of the bow of that great-souled Rama along with an arrow fitted on it. [4-28-15]"
3-28-14,"Still infuriated Khara has drawn seven more arrows that equal the radiance of Indra&#39;s thunderbolts and hit Rama&#39;s armour in that war. [4-28-16]"
3-28-15,"Then, on distressing Rama of unequalled vitality with a thousand arrows in that combat Khara blared a loud blare. [4-28-17]"
3-28-16,"With the arrows released by Khara that have a great egress, then that armour of Rama that has a sun-like resplendence is completely destroyed and fell on the field. [4-28-18]"
3-28-17,"When all his limbs are hit with arrows Rama is enraged and in that war Rama flared up like a fumeless flaring fire. [4-28-19]"
3-28-18,"Then Rama, the blaster of enemies, strung bowstring to another thunderously blasting bow, to end the enemy. [4-28-20]"
3-28-19,"That which is a very admirable bow of Vishnu and that which is awarded by great-sage Agastya, upraising that choicest bow Rama rushed towards Khara. [4-28-21]"
3-28-20,"With arrows that have golden fins and curved barbs that highly infuriated Rama then fragmented Khara&#39;s flagstaff with flag in that war. [4-28-22]"
3-28-21,"That eye-pleasing golden flagstaff with flag is severally shattered and fell onto ground as if it is god-damned sun fallen on earth. [4-28-23]"
3-28-22,"By that Khara is enraged, and as one who is aware of striking crucial parts/war tactics assaulted on the chest of Rama with four arrows, and even on other limbs, as one would prod an elephant with lancets. [4-28-24]"
3-28-23,"Impacted with various arrows unloosened from the bow of Khara, limbs of Rama are drenched in blood and he became highly indignant. [4-28-25]"
3-28-24,"On aiming his great bow that ablest one among archers, namely Rama, then in that war released six arrows targeting pointedly. [4-28-26]"
3-28-25,"Rama indeed hit Khara&#39;s head with one arrow, with two his hands, and next with three crescent shaped arrows he hit his chest. [4-28-27]"
3-28-26,"Then afterwards that great-resplendent Rama wishing to eliminate the demon, infuriately launched thirteen iron arrows that are sharply whetted and similar to the dazzle of sun. [4-28-28]"
3-28-27,"That mighty Raghava who equals Indra in combats, smiling at the warfare of Khara, smashed the yoke of the chariot with one arrow; with four, four of the dappled horses; with the sixth, the head of the charioteer of Khara; with three, the three-pronged shaft from yoke to the base of chariot; with two the axels, thus that chariot is fragmented. Then, on wrecking Khara&#39;s bow on which an arrow is placed with the twelfth, that mighty one Rama impaled Khara with the thirteenth arrow that is similar to a thunderbolt. [4-28-29, 30, 31]"
3-28-28,"With his bow utterly shattered, chariot fragmented, horses killed, and charioteer felled, that Khara then hopped down to ground from the dilapidated chariot wielding a mace, and stood fast. [4-28-32]"
3-28-29,"The gods as well as great-sages have then came together and assembled in heavens, and those assemblies that are aboard their aircrafts are highly gladdened at the exploit of the great chariot-fighter Rama, and they worshipped him with their adjoined palms. [4-28-33]"
3-29-1,"Rama, the great-resplendent, spoke these words forbiddingly albeit softly to Khara who lost his chariot but staying his course wielding a mace. [3-29-1]"
3-29-2,"Although you hold sway over a gigantic force abounding with elephants horses and chariots, you have perpetrated heinous deeds in Dandaka forests that are loathsome to all the worlds, that is unseemliest to this soldiery. [3-29-2]"
3-29-3,"One who causes suffering to living beings, besides being a transgressor and completely ruthless, he does not stand up for himself even if he were to be the lord of all the three worlds. [3-29-3]"
3-29-4,"All people will eliminate him, oh, nightwalker, who is imperious and an infringer of worldly routine, as they would eradicate a vicious serpent, in the event of its running across them. [3-29-4]"
3-29-5,"He who goes on performing evils selfishly, obsessively, heedlessly, more so delightedly, he will see the results of his own doings, like red-tailed-lizard on its eating self-destructive hailstones, obsessively and delightedly. [3-29-5]"
3-29-6,"The residents of Dandaka forest are the highly-propitious sages that tread the path of virtue, and oh, demon, what benefit you gain in killing them, really? [3-29-6]"
3-29-7,"Even if a fortune is made for a lavish living with an iota of merit, the evildoers, that too reprobates, further more those that are abominated by world will not last long, no more that petrified tree trunks. [3-29-7]"
3-29-8,"One who undertakes evildoings will definitely and seasonably reap their fruits, which in his case will be ghoulish, as with the flowering of trees according to season. [3-29-8]"
3-29-9,"In the world one acquires the fruit of profane acts not before long, oh, nightwalker, and it will be like venomous food devoured. [3-29-9]"
3-29-10,"I am the king who arrived to exterminate the lives of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation of world."
3-29-11,"I am the one who arrived at the behest of the king Dasharatha, or Bharata to exterminate the lives of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation of world. [3-29-10]"
3-29-12,"Now, my arrows that are decorated in gold will be released on you like snakes rebounding from a snake-pit, and they will tear you asunder, and on riving you they will bounce back into my quivers. [3-29-11]"
3-29-13,"Now eliminated in war, you along with your army will tread behind those sages that were treading the path of virtue, on whom you have so far feasted in Dandaka forest. [3-29-12]"
3-29-14,"Let the supreme sages who were earlier slain by you may now see abiding on their aircrafts, your abidance in hellish death pangs when assaulted with my arrows. [3-29-13]"
3-29-15,"Attack me as you wish... make an effort... you the knave of your clan... now I am going to toss your head down like a palm-fruit... Thus Rama addressed Khara. [3-29-14]"
3-29-16,"But when Rama said thus, Khara is infuriated and convulsed in anger, and he replied Rama with bloodshot eyes, laughing boisterously. [3-29-15]"
3-29-17,"On killing average demons in war, oh, son of Dasharatha, how you praise yourself when you yourself are un-praiseworthy? Thus Khara started to speak to Rama. [3-29-16]"
3-29-18,"Those best of men that are victorious and mighty will not boast anything, for they will be really proud of their own valour. [3-29-17]"
3-29-19,"Oh, Rama, as to how undignified Kshatriya-s that are frivolous and irresolute in self-confidence will boast in the world, likewise you too are boasting in a meaningless manner. [3-29-18]"
3-29-20,"Who will be that valiant that speaks about his lineage at wartime, that too, when the death-time is looming large! And, there will there be someone who broaches his self-extols in such an inopportune situation, is it! [3-29-19]"
3-29-21,"Howsoever your ignominy is well shown by your self-praise, like the manifestation of gold on the tip of grass-blade burnt by fire, where the fire on grass-blade is no fire, and the bulb of fire appearing at the tip of grass-blade as a bulb of gold, is no gold. [3-29-20]"
3-29-22,"But you are seeing me wielding a mace and standing before you like an unshakable and jagged mountain laden with ores, isn&#39;t it! [3-29-21]"
3-29-23,"As to how the Terminator wielding noose is enough to take away all the lives in all the three worlds, handling my mace I am enough for detracting your life from you. [3-29-22]"
3-29-24,"Even though much is to be said in your respect I will not continue to say, for the sun is getting at the dusk thereby disruption to war occurs. [3-29-23]"
3-29-25,"You have killed fourteen thousand demons and on killing you I will wipe the tears of the wives of those dead demons today itself. Khara said so to Rama. [3-29-24]"
3-29-26,"Saying thus that highly infuriated Khara hurled his mace towards Rama, around which there are superb golden cinctures, and which is extremely glaring like a thunderbolt. [3-29-25]"
3-29-27,"Forcefully discharged from Khara&#39;s hands that highly fiery and stupendous mace rendering trees and shrubs down to ashes darted towards Rama. [3-29-26]"
3-29-28,"When that monstrous mace similar to the halter of the Terminator is swooping down, Rama smashed it to smithereens with his arrows while it is still sky rocketing. [3-29-27]"
3-29-29,"That mace splintered with arrows of Rama fell crumbling onto the surface of earth as a springing female snake would fall down by the strength of spells and nostrums. [3-29-28]"
3-30-1,"On smashing the mace with arrows Raghava spoke this sentence to Khara smiling him out of temper, without assaulting weaponless and flustering Khara, because Rama is the patron of virtue following the protocol of righteous war. [3-30-1]"
3-30-2,"So, this is all the strength of yours and your army that is displayed and nothing more to display, is it! You wretched demon, it is paltriest compared to my strength, yet you vaunt aloud futilely! [3-30-2]"
3-30-3,"This mace of yours in which you repose your bombastic aplomb, now completely battered with my arrows has gone onto the surface of earth, so also is your vanity. [3-30-3]"
3-30-4,"What that is said by you, &#39;I will dab the tears of the demons whose kinfolk are dead here...&#39; even this word of yours is a fake. [3-30-4]"
3-30-5,"In boasting you are knavish, in character roguish, and in behaviour ghoulish, such a demon as you are, I will take your life away as the Divine Eagle Garuda took away Ambrosia. [3-30-5]"
3-30-6,"Now, my arrows will rip and chop off your throat, and then the earth will guzzle the blood gushed therefrom garnished with froth and foam. [3-30-6]"
3-30-7,"You will go to eternal sleep embracing the earth as you embrace an un-gainable lady, when both of your arms are knocked down to slide on earth, and limbs smeared with dirt. [3-30-7]"
3-30-8,"While you are in profound sleep, oh, notorious demon, this Dandaka forest becomes a shelter to the shelter-worthy sages and saints. [3-30-8]"
3-30-9,"When the strongholds of demons in your Janasthaana are ruined with my arrows, the sages in this forest will move about everywhere, fearlessly. [3-30-9]"
3-30-10,"The demonesses who terrorized others so far will be pitiably terrorised now, and they flee away very quickly with tear-wet faces as their kinsmen are killed. [3-30-10]"
3-30-11,"To which demonesses your kind of grievous demon is the husband, they must have taken birth in a befittingly grievous family like that of yours, and must be well-matched to you in grievous atrocities, and though they might not have tasted a grievous situation so far, since their lives have become meaningless, now they will become the enjoyers of the empathy of grief. [3-30-11]"
3-30-12,"You are atrocious in conduct because you countervail against Veda-s, debased by conscience because you counteract to Vedic rituals, and you are countermanding Vedic procedures because you have always been bothersome to Brahmans, and those Brahmans becoming sceptical of your deeds of hindrance, they are hesitatingly consigning oblations into Ritual-Fire, which are to be swiftly dropped into fire to the chants of hymns and even on time, hence you are countervailing against Veda-s and counteracting to their rituals, and countermanding their procedures. Thus Rama spoke to Khara irefully. [3-30-12]"
3-30-13,"While Raghava is speaking that way with such an impetuosity in that forest, Khara started to intimidate him rancorously in a voice stridulous than braying. [3-30-13]"
3-30-14,"Priding yourself resolutely you are unfearing even in a fearful situation, thereby you have indeed gone into the control of death, and for sure you are unmindful of what is speakable and what is not. Thus, Khara started his tongue-lashing. [3-30-14]"
3-30-15,"Such of those men on whom the Lead of the Time verily closes in, they will not know what is to be done and what not, for all of their six senses will be rendered insensible. Thus Khara intimidated Rama. [3-30-15]"
3-30-16,"Saying so to Rama that nightwalker Khara then knitting his brows tightly saw everywhere for an assault weapon for use in that combat, and then he indeed found one not far away from him, namely a huge saala tree. [3-30-16, 17a]"
3-30-17,"He curled his lips in frown and started to extricate that Saala tree, and that great-mighty Khara on forcefully uprooting that tree with both of hands hurled it aiming at Rama, braying loudly and shouting at him &#39;you are dead...&#39; [3-30-17b, 18]"
3-30-18,"But that adventurous Rama on shredding that tree which is swooping down with a torrent of arrows, and deciding to eliminate that Khara in that war evoked an unusual rancour, which rancour is equally an unusual facet of Rama. [3-30-19]"
3-30-19,"Rama whose body is perspiring and whose eyes are acrimoniously bloodshot at ends, he utterly shredded Khara with a thousand arrows in that war. [3-30-20]"
3-30-20,"Copious frothy blood gushed out from the gashes of arrows on the mountainous body of Khara, like the rapids on Mt. Prasavana, and it overflowed on earth too. [3-30-21]"
3-30-21,"When Khara is tormented with the arrows of Rama in that conflict he is bedevilled and with his blood stinking body he quickly bolted towards that Rama alone. [3-30-22]"
3-30-22,"When Khara is descending on boisterously with his body bathed in blood, that adept one in the Science of Archery, <em>dhanur veda</em> , the scripture on archery, and that valorous Rama, in swiftness lurched a little...say, two or three steps... [3-30-23]"
3-30-23,"Then, Rama snatched an arrow which is similar to the Ritual-fire, and secondary only to the ultimate missile, namely the Brahma-missile, for the elimination of Khara in war. [3-30-24]"
3-30-24,"That particular arrow is made available to Rama through Sage Agastya by the king of gods, namely Indra, because Indra is a sensible one about the future course of events, and he is also prosperous in securing impossible weaponry, and now Rama fitted such an arrow on his bow and released it towards Khara. [3-30-25]"
3-30-25,"That formidable arrow is promptly released on Rama&#39;s stretching the bowstring up to his ear, bending bow almost to a circularity, and which arrow is thunderous while in egress like the thunder of a thunderbolt, and that has come and plunged inthe chest of Khara. [3-30-26]"
3-30-26,"Khara fell down on to earth and on being burnt by the radiation of that arrow he is like demon Andhaka, who once was very completely burnt by Rudra in Shveta-araNya, the White-forest. [3-30-27]"
3-30-27,"As with fall of demon Vritta or fall of demon Bala who are eliminated by Indra with his Thunderbolt, or as with the collapse of demon Namuchi who is eliminated by the same Indra just with forth or foam, Khara too is brought down. [3-30-28]"
3-30-28,"In this meantime gods gathering along with carana-s drummed celestial drums from all over and showered flowers on Rama from all over. [3-30-29, 30a]"
3-30-29,"And those gods and other celestials in their amazement said among themselves that &#39;in one and half hours, say seventy two minutes of this extreme crack-down Rama with his sharp arrows has eradicated fourteen thousand guise changing demons, including their chieftains Khara and Duushana. [3-30-30b, 31]"
3-30-30,"Aha! Surprising is this great deed of Rama, the shrewd-soul, what a valour, what a fortitude, really, his valour and fortitude are like those of Vishnu... Thus saying that way all of those gods have gone away as the have come. [3-30-32, 33a]"
3-30-31,"All the kingly-sages and elite-sages along with Sage Agastya, who as incidentally came here to witness the victory of Rama, then on foregathering near at Rama delightedly said this on adoring him. [3-30-33b, 34a]"
3-30-32,"He that great-resplendent one, the controller of demon Paka, and the destroyer of enemy&#39;s cities, namely Indra, once came to the meritorious hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga only for the purpose such an elimination of demons. [3-30-34b, 35a]"
3-30-33,"For the purpose of eradicating these demons who are the evildoers by nature and the natural enemies to saintly people you are led to this countryside by the great sages with an ideation. [3-30-35b, 36a]"
3-30-34,"That which is the task of ours it is accomplished by you, oh, son of Dasharatha, now that Dandaka is unimpeded these great-sages will be practising their respective sacred devoirs in it. Thus, the sages expressed their thanksgiving. [3-30-36b, 37a]"
3-30-35,"In the meanwhile the brave Lakshmana exiting from the mountain cave came along with Seetha to their hermitage, and he is charmed at the victory of his brother Rama. [3-30-37b, 38a]"
3-30-36,"And then that brave and victories Rama too came towards hermitage while great-sages reverenced him, and he entered the hermitage while Lakshmana came forward to greet him. [3-30-38b, 39a]"
3-30-37,"And Seetha on seeing her husband, the eliminator of enemies and accorder of happiness to sages, embraced her husband Rama, rejoicingly. [3-30-39b, 40a]"
3-30-38,"Janaka&#39;s daughter Seetha on seeing the hordes of demons eliminated, and even on observing her husband is also scatheless, she is all-smiles for him smiling sniggeringly. [3-30-40]"
3-30-39,"She whose face is beaming with delight that Seetha, the daughter Janaka, on seeing Rama who has eliminated demonic troops, and whom great-sages are worshipping, again embraced him and became rapturous. [3-30-41]"
3-31-1,"This chapter is removed from the critical edition and retained by traditional versions There are discussions on this chapter whether it is the original work or an interpolated one. Some more details are given in the endnote. Akampana&#39;s character inevitably has continuity in the war scene at the end."
3-31-2,"Then on going hurriedly from Janasthaana and on speedily entering Lanka Akampana spoke these words to Ravana. [3-31-1]"
3-31-3,"Oh, king, many demons positioned in Janasthaana are killed, Khara is also killed in war, and somehow I have come here. [3-31-2]"
3-31-4,"Thus said, then that ten-faced Ravana is infuriated with bloodshot eyes, and as though to burn down whole world with his radiance he spoke this to Akampana. [3-31-3]"
3-31-5,"Who is that dead-and-gone that has destroyed my indomitable Janasthaana? Who is it that has indeed opted for no recourse in all of the worlds? [3-31-4]"
3-31-6,"Evoking indignation in me it is really impossible for Indra to be happy; even for Kubera - no; for Yama - no; why them, even Vishnu cannot be happy. [3-31-5]"
3-31-7,"I am the End-Time for the Time-god himself, I will burn down the Fire-god, and I am capable of conjoining Death with the virtue of deathliness. [3-31-6]"
3-31-8,"If I am enraged I will incinerate Sun-god or Fire-god just with my radiance, I will halt even the impetuosity of Wind-god with that of mine. Thus Ravana said about himself. [3-31-7]"
3-31-9,"Akampana with his palms adjoined and voice hesitant with fear sought for the clemency of that decahedral demon Ravana who is enraged in that way. [3-31-8]"
3-31-10,"When the supremo of demons Dasha-griiva pardoned him then that Akampana spoke these words, unfalteringly and trustfully. [3-31-9]"
3-31-11,"He is a youth whose shoulders are mighty, arms round and lengthy, built like that a lion, who is the son of Dasharatha and known as Rama. [3-31-10]"
3-31-12,"He is blue-black in complexion, a highly renowned one with matchless might and valour, a magnificent one such as he is he slew Duushana along with Khara in Janasthaana. [3-31-11]"
3-31-13,"On hearing the words of Akampana, the chief of demons Ravana, spoke these words hissing like a kingly serpent. [3-31-12]"
3-31-14,"The question is whether that Rama arrived at Janasthaana associated with Indra and along with all of the immortal gods? Oh, Akampana, speak about it. [3-31-13]"
3-31-15,"Akampana again detailed about the might and valour of that great souled Rama on hearing that sentence of Ravana. [3-31-14]"
3-31-16,"Rama means someone who is highly resplendent, an ablest archer among all archers, one who is endowed with divine missiles and divine attributes, and he is the one who conducts warfare with a supreme conduct. [3-31-15]"
3-31-17,"And a mighty one with redly eyes and drumbeat like voice, and whose face is shiny like the full-moon is Rama&#39;s selfsame younger brother known as Lakshmana. [3-31-16]"
3-31-18,"Alike the wind associating with fire this Lakshmana is associated with that glorious and nonpareil prince Rama, and that firestorm, namely Rama, destroyed Janasthaana. [3-31-17]"
3-31-19,"They are not any great souled gods or any heavenly beings as such, hence there is no need to doubt about it. Rama unloosened his gold-finned and feather-winged arrows, which on becoming five-faced serpents started consuming the demons. [3-31-18]"
3-31-20,"To whichever nook those demons smitten by fear of those serpent-like are fleeing, they have seeing Rama alone standing afore them in that corner, and oh, merited king Ravana, in this way your Janasthaana is totally ruined by that Rama. [3-31-19b, 20] [3-31-19]"
3-31-21,"On hearing the words of Akampana Ravana said these words, I will to go to Janasthaana to kill Rama along with Lakshmana. [3-31-21]"
3-31-22,"When Ravana said so then Akampana said these words in reply,  listen, oh, king, what all has happened, and of what in actuality is Rama&#39;s spirit and grit. [3-31-22]"
3-31-23,"Rama, the highly renolwned, is invincible just by braving against him, for that Rama in fury can stall the onrush of a plethoric river with his arrows. [3-31-23]"
3-31-24,"That magnificent Rama can collapse even the firmament along with its starlets, stars and planets, and he even can elevate the earth if it were to collapse. [3-31-24]"
3-31-25,"On breaching the shoreline of the ocean with his arrows that lord Rama can deluge worlds, and he can stem the tide of turbulent ocean, or can even stall the agent of that turbulence, namely the wind. [3-31-25]"
3-31-26,"That great valorous and the ablest among humans is capable to destroy all the worlds with his valour, and even capable of creating the people again."
3-31-27,"Or, again dissolving all the worlds into himself, that great contemplator who transcends all is even capable of creating the creation again from out of him. [3-31-26]"
3-31-28,"Oh, Dashagriiva, it is impossible to conquer that Rama in war for your, either singly or along with the hosts of the demon-supporters of yours, as one heaven cannot be won by many sinners. [3-31-27]"
3-31-29,"I do not think that he is killable even for all god and demons, and this is the idea to kill him, and to this you may listen attentively. [3-31-28]"
3-31-30,"An excellent woman in the world is there, a youthful one with symmetrical limbs, a jewel-like lady adorned with jewellery, that slender-waisted one who is known as Seetha is his wife. [3-31-29]"
3-31-31,"No goddess can be likened to that mature lady; a gandharva female - no; a apsara female - no; a pannaga female -no, then how can there be a woman of her like? [3-31-30]"
3-31-32,"You forcefully abduct his wife when she is in solitude, and indeed Rama will not exist reft of Seetha. Akampana advised Ravana in this way. [3-31-31]"
3-31-33,"The chief of demons Ravana favouring that idea thought of it and that mighty armed Ravana then spoke to Akampana. [3-31-32]"
3-31-34,"Agreed! I wish to go alone early in the morning with a charioteer and I delightfully wish to lead Vaidehi into the elegant city Lanka. Ravana declared that way. [3-31-33]"
3-31-35,"Saying so Ravana journeyed in a chariot that is yoked with mule-like horses, and that has the dazzling of the sun, whereby all the directions are made to glitter. [3-31-34]"
3-31-36,"That opalescent chariot of the lord of demons while speedily progressing through starry way shone forth as if it is the moon in clouds. [3-31-35]"
3-31-37,"On going to the hermitage of Maareecha which is at a distant place Maareecha the son of Tataka received Ravana and venerated that king of demons with sweetmeats and savouries that are unavailable to humans. [3-31-36]"
3-31-38,"Offering proper seat and water for washing feet and hands Maareecha personally attended Ravana and spoke to him this sentence that is worded meaningfully. [3-31-37]"
3-31-39,"Oh, king and supremo of demons, I am anxious to know whether everything safe and secure to the inhabitants of your kingdom, for I am not in the know of the reason by which now you have come here rushingly. [3-31-38]"
3-31-40,"When Maareecha said so to him that greatly radiant one who is a sententious speaker that Ravana thereafter spoke this sentence. [3-31-39]"
3-31-41,"Oh, sire, Rama who is indefatigable in warring has ruined my security stationed at Janasthaana, and in war he even brought down all of Janasthaana which is undefeatable so far, such as I am, to me you have to render friendly help in kidnapping Rama&#39;s wife. [3-31-40]"
3-31-42,"On hearing the words of that chief of demons, Maareecha spoke these words, who broached the subject of Seetha with you, an enemy in the fakery of a friend? Oh, tigerly demon, who is that censurable one that is unhappy with you, since he is giving such a self-ruinous advise? [3-31-42]"
3-31-43," &#39;Seetha may be brought to Lanka...&#39; who said it, say him to me, who is that one desiring to cut off the prominence of all the demons in all worlds in saying so?"
3-31-44,"Who is desirous of getting a zenithal demon ruling all the three worlds to be cut-off when he said that Seetha shall be brought to Lanka?"
3-31-45,"Who is saying that Seetha is to be brought to Lanka with a desire to get your apogeal ten-heads that are prominent among all the clansmen of demons to be cut-off? [3-31-43]"
3-31-46,"Also, he who has motivated you in this way is an undoubted enemy of yours, for he wanted to extricate the fangs of a snake from its mouth, of course, through you. [3-31-44]"
3-31-47,"By whom and by which purpose of his you are made to blunder upon this awry path, oh, king, it is as good as his hitting hard on your head while you are fast asleep. [3-31-45]"
3-31-48,"Oh, Ravana, it will be unbefitting to raise an eye to see Rama in war, who will be then like a majestic elephant that has an impeccable dynasty and bloodline as its mammoth trunk, personal radiance as its indomitable might, very firm pair of arms as its pernicious tusks, more so, who will be with the redolence of the irrepressible lineage of Raghava-s. [3-31-46]"
3-31-49,"To be in the midst of war itself is the fury of that lion called Rama, by which that lion raises its tail touching the back of its trunk, that lion is all-inclusive with forelegs, paws, and claws that are included in arrows, while its fangs are swords, and it is the killer of the deer called the expert killer-demons, and mind you, do not dare to rouse that sleeping man-lion. [3-31-47]"
3-31-50,"His bow is crocodilian, his shoulder-speed is quagmire, his arrows are tidal, and the great immensity of his war itself is a tideland, and oh, king of demons, it is inapt of you to slide down into the much-ghoulish mouth of that abyssal ocean, called Rama. [3-31-48]"
3-31-51,"Oh, lord of Lanka, be appeased towards Rama, be quietened and gently proceed to Lanka. You take delight in your wives, and let Rama be delighting with wife in forests. Thus Mareecha spoke to Ravana. [3-31-49]"
3-31-52,"When thus said by Maareecha that ten faced Ravana returned to his city Lanka and entered his best house and home. [3-31-50]"
3-32-1,"On seeing the fourteen thousands demons of heinous crimes, and even on seeing Trishira, Duushana, and even Khara, who are all exterminated by lone Rama, then Shuurpanakha emitted a thunderous blare like a thundercloud. [3-32-1, 2]"
3-32-2,"Highly agitated to witness the deed done by Rama, which deed is highly impossible for others, she hurried Lanka ruled by Ravana. [3-32-3]"
3-32-3,"She saw Ravana who is fulgent with his own radiance, seated with ministers at his nearby in the midst of the divine aircraft Pushpaka, as with Indra who will be sitting amidst wind-gods. [3-32-4]"
3-32-4,"Seated similar to the Sun in firmament on a supreme golden throne, which resembles a golden Altar of Fire, and he himself resembling the blazing Ritual-fire spurting out of it when that Golden-Fire-Altar is drenched with plentiful ghee, she saw such a Ravana. [3-32-5]"
3-32-5,"An invincible one either for gods or gandharva-s, or to sages with exalted souls, or even to any other entity worth its name, whose appearance itself is catastrophic, and who is sitting identical to the Terminator, as though that Terminator himself is sitting with a wide gaped mouth, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-6]"
3-32-6,"One who is severally bruised in several combats of gods and demons with the thunderbolts from the Vajra weapon of Indra, and one who is severally blotched on his chest when the prongs of the tusks of Airavata, the lordly elephant of Indra, gored his chest, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-7]"
3-32-7,"One who has twenty arms, ten faces and a broad chest, and a possessor of all regalia of Indra like white parasol, white fanning instruments, colours and the like insigne, and at that brave one who is attributed with all of the kingly attributes, Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-8]"
3-32-8,"Blent with the gleam of Lapis gems studded in his ornaments his glisten is alike that gem, while his ear-knobs are made out of refined gold, and his arms strongish, teeth whitish, mouth widish and he is mountainous, and Shuurpanakha saw such a Ravana. [3-32-9]"
3-32-9,"His body bears hundreds of welts caused when assaulted with Vishnu-disc for hundreds of times in wars with gods, and when assaulted for hundreds of times with the other assaults-missiles in other gruesome wars as well, and Shuurpanakha saw at such a Ravana. [3-32-10]"
3-32-10,"Likewise, whose limbs are thrashed with thrashing missilery of all gods, whereby his body and soul have become harsh, thus he can perpetrate anything swiftly at his will, and he who can capably roil an un-perturbable ocean at his wish, at such Ravana Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-11]"
3-32-11,"At him who is a volleyer of mountain peaks, a represser of gods, an extirpator of ethical values, and a molester of others wives, Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-12]"
3-32-12,"He who is a marksman of every divine missile, and an ever interdictor of Vedic-rituals, and who on going to the city named Bhogavati, the capital of Naga-s, and on defeating Vaasuki, the King of Serpents, has abducted the dear wife of Taksha on molesting her, and Shuurpanakha saw such a molester of others wives. [3-32-13, 14a]"
3-32-13,"On going to Mt. Kailash he who has defeated the god who uses humans as his vehicle, namely Kubera, and snatched away his aircraft, namely Pushpaka, which aircraft transits at the wish of its steersman, and Shuurpanakha saw such a grabber of others possessions. [3-32-14b, 15a]"
3-32-14,"He who enviously devastated the divine gardens of Kubera, called Caitraratha, along with a divine Lake of Lotuses pertaining to the same Kubera, called Pushkarini, and the gardens of Indra, called Nandana, along with other paradisiacal gardens of gods, Shuurpanakha saw such an envious demon. [3-32-15b, 16a]"
3-32-15,"Shuurpanakha saw him who is similar to the pinnacle of a mountain, and who with his two hands forestalls the highly propitious ones that are the stiflers of their enemies, namely the Sun and Moon, when they tend to rise. [3-32-16b, 17a]"
3-32-16,"That courageous one who in early times has practised ascesis for ten thousand years in a great-forest, and who on accomplishing it has dedicated ten of his heads to the Self-Created Brahma, she saw such a Ravana with such ten heads. [3-32-17b, 18a]"
3-32-17,"Whereby, to whom there is an indemnity against death in war at the hand of gods, demons, gandharva-s, devils, birds, or reptiles, excepting humans, and Shuurpanakha saw such an unimperilled Ravana. [3-32-18b, 19a]"
3-32-18,"He who is an extreme-ultraist that expropriates the Soma-juice-oblation form the vessels of oblation in Vedic-rituals, which Soma juice-oblation is blest with Vedic-hymns and kept separately by Vedic Brahmans, since it is intended and shall belong to Indra and other divinities, and she saw such a plunderer. [3-32-19b, 20a]"
3-32-19,"He who is such an embezzler of the Vedic-rituals at the time of their culmination, a malicious one, and one with cruel acts, a hinderer of Vedic-rituals, or, the slayer of those Brahmans that conduct Vedic-rituals contrary to his wishes, and one who is heartless and a rampant demon, who is a delighter in the iniquity to the people, at him Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-20b, 21a]"
3-32-20,"She that demoness Shuurpanakha saw her brother who makes all beings to wail, an alarming one to all the worlds, an atrocious one and highly formidable Ravana. [3-32-21b, 22a]"
3-32-21,"And at him who is conspicuously sitting on a throne, attired and bejewelled in excellent apparels and jewels, shining forth with marvellous garlands, and who is like the Ultimate-Time on the rise destined for the Eventual-Time. [3-32-22b, 23a]"
3-32-22,"Demoness Shuurpanakha nearing Ravana, who is the highly fortunate king of demons, an enemy-destroyer and a felicity of the dynasty of Sage Pulasta, and who is now surrounded by his ministers, she spoke this sentence. [3-32-23b, 24]"
3-32-23,"She who is disfigured by the high souled Lakshmana, and who is still perplexed with the fear of Lakshmana and her own craving for Rama as well, on displaying her misfortune to everybody that fearless rover Shuurpanakha spoke this very caustic sentence to Ravana, whose eyes are broad and burning. [3-32-25]"
3-33-1,"This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Kishkindha Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with<em>raaja niiti shastra</em> &#39;political science&#39; and there in Kishkindha the only rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas in here Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shuurpanakha. Though Shuurpanakha is a sultry and harpy demoness, the Sage Valmiki has put some rational words on her tongue in forewarning Ravana."
3-33-2,"Then that doleful Shuurpanakha spoke these scornful words to Ravana who makes the world to wail in the presence of his ministers. [3-33-1]"
3-33-3,"Highly infatuated with lustful gratifications you are incontinent and unchecked, thus you are unobservant of a calamitous jeopardy that has surfaced, though you ought to be observant of it as a king. [3-33-2]"
3-33-4,"If a king deports himself in an overly self-assured manner, that too with self-serving motives, and clings only to dirty pleasures, he will be unhonoured by people as with a crematory fire. [3-33-3]"
3-33-5,"The king who will not deal with the concerns of kingdom, in person and on time, he and his kingdom and even those concerns of his kingdom will get ruined. [3-33-4]"
3-33-6,"If a king is inaccessible to spies for exchange of information, unavailable for subjects for an audience for a similar appraisal, more so if he is intemperately not able to impose self-discipline, people will eschew such a king from a distance as elephants will refrain themselves from the mud of river from a distance. [3-33-5]"
3-33-7,"Which of those kings that will not safeguard their kingdoms by remaining in a self-restrained manner, they will not outshine advantageously, like mountains submerged under ocean. [3-33-6]"
3-33-8,"Without keeping the kingdom under your personal control, you have shuffled the administration onto the ministers and army personnel like Khara, Duushana et al. And these figureheads alone become the tiderips, for they quarrel among themselves about the kingship of Lanka after your ruin, and they alone are floating like oceanic tides up above your head and thus you are a submerged sovereign. In any way, your doom is destined either by Rama, who is an imminent danger, or by your military managers, who are the in-built dangers."
3-33-9,"Externally you are belligerent with sensible gods, gandharva-s and other demons, and internally you are needful of intelligence agents, and such as you are, you are an erratic even, then how can you thrive as a king! [3-33-7]"
3-33-10,"Your bent is boyish and you are mindless, oh, demon, you are not able to know the knowable danger because you are carefree, and how do you thrive as a king! [3-33-8]"
3-33-11,"Oh, so-called best one among triumphant kings, those kings that do not retain spies, treasuries and strategies under their control, but vouchsafe them to others, they are of a piece with the peasantry. [3-33-9]"
3-33-12,"Oh, titular overlord of humans, only some can be called prescient kings because they see all the situations happening distantly through their spies. [3-33-10]"
3-33-13,"I believe that you have no spies worth their profession, yet you are associated with artless ministers worthy to worship you, hence you are incognisant of the ruination of all of your subjects in Janasthaana, including Janasthaana. [3-33-11]"
3-33-14,"A single soul called Rama has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of dreadful deeds in Janasthaana, even Duushana is killed, even Khara is also killed. [3-33-12]"
3-33-15,"That indefatigable champion Rama gave security to the sages, rendered Dandaka forest safeguarded, and he put Janasthaana to rout. [3-33-13]"
3-33-16,"On your part you are but selfish, hotheaded, and others like the appeasers of your lust, or these artless ministers, or those underpaid unfaithful spies hold you down, and such as you are, you are unperceptive of the calamity rising up against you in your own kingdom. [3-33-14]"
3-33-17,"Should a king be overweening, an under-payer, an improvident, self-conceited, and dubious, all his subjects bid goodbye to such a king when he is in strife. [3-33-15]"
3-33-18,"Should a ruler be unduly self-conceited, self-centred, self-adulating and a spitfire too, his own kith and kin will ruin him when he is in distress. [3-33-16]"
3-33-19,"That king who does not officiate his good offices, nor un-panicked into panicky situations, he will be quickly overthrown from his kingdom, and on becoming a debased individual he will be equated with a piece of straw in this world. [3-33-17]"
3-33-20,"Dried sticks, globs or the particles of dust are of some avail, but kings fallen from their position are of no avail. [3-33-18]"
3-33-21,"As to how a used up raiment or a crumpled flower-tassel is meaningless, likewise a king derelict from his kingdom, though functional, is meaningless. [3-33-19]"
3-33-22,"Which king will be cautious, clever, conscientious, with his controlled senses, and thankful, that king survives for a long time. [3-33-20]"
3-33-23,"He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness will be wakeful even though he slept well closing his physical eyes and he who will make his fury and favour evident to people without any concealment or cunningness, people will highly revere him as a king."
3-33-24,"He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness wakeful even though he sleeps fast closing his physical eyes, thus discarded are his fury and frenzy as well, because he knows as to who is to be treated furiously and who is to be favoured, and thus people will revere him as a judicious king. [3-33-21]"
3-33-25,"But, oh, Ravana, because you are imprudent you are bereft of these merits, and such as you are, unknown is the very great massacre of demons to you, though not personally, but at least through your spies. [3-33-22]"
3-33-26,"You are the humiliator of others, you hobnob only with your ravishes, and incognisant of the object for apportionment of time and place for your activities, as to when and where and how the things are to be dealt with. And, as you are not attending any kingly activity, or do not focus your mind in deciding rights and wrongs, thereby your kingdom will get ruined and you will be imperilled, not before long. Thus Shuurpanakha declaimed Ravana about his worthlessness as a king. [3-33-23]"
3-33-27,"In this way when Shuurpanakha extolled only his negative traits, he that lord of night-walkers Ravana, who holds only his pride, power and prosperity dear to him, pored them over in his mind and contemplated over a time. [3-33-24]"
3-34-1,"On observing Shuurpanakha who is speaking bitter words against him in the presence of ministers then Ravana is highly infuriated and queried her. [1-34-1]"
3-34-2,"Who is Rama? How brave he is? Of what mien and what calibre he is? And for what reason he entered the highly inscrutable Dandaka forest? [1-34-2]"
3-34-3,"What is the weapon of that Rama by whom these many demons are killed in war, likewise Duushana and Trishira are killed, and even the unkillable Khara is killed? Oh, lady with fascinating limbs, who disfigured you? That you tell. [1-34-3, 4a]"
3-34-4,"When the king of demons has asked her thus, she that demoness Shuurpanakha who is in a fit of fury then commenced to describe Rama in the point of fact. [3-34-4b, 5a]"
3-34-5,"Dasharatha&#39;s son Rama is the one with inescapable arms and keen-eyed, but has jute-cloths and skin of black-deer for his dress, yet in semblance he is similar to the Love-god. [3-34-5b, 6a]"
3-34-6,"Yanking out a bow with golden fillets, and that is similar to the bow of Indra in its shine, he strews candent iron-arrows that simulate snakes with deadly poison. [3-34-6b, 7a]"
3-34-7,"It has become imperceivable for me to me to see when and how he drew his ghastly arrows from quiver on the battleground; or, stretching his bow admitting those arrows on bowstring - no; or, his releasing those sharp edged arrows from the bow - no; why them, that great mighty Rama himself has become imperceptible in the fastness of his action. [3-34-7b, 8a]"
3-34-8,"As with a crop of grain devastated by a hailstorm of Indra, I could only see that best army while it is being annihilated with a downpour of arrows. [3-34-8b, 9a]"
3-34-9,"Thus a lone foot-soldier with his excruciating arrows has exterminated fourteen thousand demons with fiendish might, including Duushana, and along withKhara, say, within one and half hours. [3-34-9b,10]"
3-34-10,"Accorded is the protection to the sages, and Dandaka is made as a snuggest place for them. I am the lone one somehow let off by such a high-minded Rama, of course, on humiliating me by cutting my nose and ears. Maybe, it is because he is hesitant of woman-slaughter for he is a well-versed soul. [1-34-11, 12]"
3-34-11,"A highly resplendent one who by his trait matches his brother in bravery, an adherent and a devotee of his brother, such a stout-hearted one is Rama&#39;s brother known as Lakshmana. [1-34-13]"
3-34-12,"That Lakshmana is an easily irritable one, he is not that easily invincible, an easy victor, but not an easygoing valiant, yet he is an intellectual at ease, and a mighty one who does not ease off, such a Lakshmana is the perpetual right-hand and the peripherally moving life of Rama. [1-34-14]"
3-34-13,"But, one with her broad-eyes, face similar to the full-moon is the dear and wedded wife of Rama, and she always takes delight in the well-being of her dear one, namely Rama. [1-34-15]"
3-34-14,"She is the one with lengthy hairdo, her nose and thighs are fine, and that glorious one with fine looks is the wife of Rama, and she is beaming forth like a sylvan deity situated in that woodland, who in turn is like Goddess Lakshmi in a temporal form. [1-34-16]"
3-34-15,"She has a complexion mathing the shade of refined gold, her nails are rosy and jutting, and she with her curvaceous hips and slim waist is the daughter of King of Videha, and known as Seetha. [1-34-17]"
3-34-16,"So far I have not seen any goddess with such a comeliness; a gandharva female - no; a yaksha female - no; a kinnara female - no; and a woman, no, not on the face of earth! [1-34-18]"
3-34-17,"To whom Seetha becomes a wife and around whom she gladly throws her arms after such a marriage, he lives more grandly than Indra in all the worlds. [1-34-19]"
3-34-18,"She is a highly gracious lady, laudable by her bodily structure, incomparable by her appearance, and she will become a seemly wife of yours, and you too will become a best husband of hers. [1-34-20]"
3-34-19,"Oh, mighty shouldered brother, but when I ventured to bring her as your wife, whose hips are broad, bosom fat and bulgy, face excellent, that cruel Lakshmana disfigured me. [1-34-21, 22a]"
3-34-20,"You too will become a groveller at the arrows Lover-god in case you now see Vaidehi with a face shining like full-moon. [1-34-22, 23a]"
3-34-21,"Hence, if you hatch an opinion to make her as your wife, and if you aspire success, now itself quickly put your best foot, namely your right foot, forward. [1-34-23]"
3-34-22,"Oh, the king of demons Ravana, if this advise of mine is pleasing to you, let this idea be actualised without any shilly-shallying in your mind. [1-34-24]"
3-34-23,"Oh, king of the demons, realise your stout-heartedness, and oh, great mighty one, let that immaculately limbed Seetha be abducted to become your wife. [1-34-25]"
3-34-24,"On recognising that Rama with his straight shooting arrows destroyed the night-walkers positioned at Janasthaana, and further on distinguishing that Duushana, and even Khara, is dispatched, it is apt of you to awake to a workable action. Thus Shuurpanakha has earbashed Ravana. [1-34-26]"
3-35-1,"On hearing the exciting advise of Shuurpanakha then Ravana bade adieu to ministers, and indeed on resolving his further task he proceeded to his personal palace chambers. [3-35-1]"
3-35-2,"While following up his thinking about that task he got a pertinent thought, and on deliberating about the credits and discredits, strengths and weaknesses of that thought he decided that &#39;this is to be done in this method only.&#39; On taking a decision in that way and with a firm mind he indeed proceeded to his excellent vehicle-garage. [3-35-2, 3]"
3-35-3,"That lordly demon then has gone to the vehicle garage in secrecy, and directed the charioteer thus as, &#39;let the chariot be harnessed.&#39; [3-35-4]"
3-35-4,"When that brisk-paced charioteer is said in this way he instantly harnessed the favourite and choicest chariot of Ravana with horses and got it ready. [3-35-5]"
3-35-5,"That chariot which is decorated with golden ornaments, yoked with monster-faced mules that have gem studded trappings is rideable by the wish of the rider, and sitting in such a chariot which is wholly golden and which rides with a sound like the pealing of thunder, that celebrated Ravana, the brother of Kubera and the lord of demons, travelled towards the lord of rivers and rivulets, namely the ocean. [3-35-6,7]"
3-35-6,"Dasha-aanana, the decahedral demon, whose complexion like the smoothened Lapis-gem is lustrous, whose regalia that comprise white long-furred fans, white parasol and the like is spectacular, whose ornaments made out of refined gold are glittering, who similar to a kingly mountain with ten pinnacles and crags by way of his ten heads and twenty arms is gorgeous, and such a chief of demons who by that way is an adversary of gods and cutthroat of eminent-sages, seated in a nitid golden chariot that is rideable by the wish of its steersman, he shone forth like a black-cloud fringed with the streaks of lightning and rimmed with flights of cranes. [3-35-8, 9, 10]"
3-35-7,"That dauntless Ravana forged ahead while viewing the area along the coastline which is interspersed with thousands of mountains and which is with variously flowered and fruited trees. [3-35-11]"
3-35-8,"Everywhere the coastland is bedecked with lotus-lakes containing clean and cool waters, and with extensive thresholds of hermitages containing Fire-altars. [3-35-12]"
3-35-9,"Entire coast is gleaming with banana plantation and glistening with coconut trees, and the saala, palm, and tamaala trees are also in full blossom. [3-35-13]"
3-35-10,"It is brightened up with thousands of reptiles and birds, with those many celestial beings that frequent the earth like gandharva-s, kinnaraa-s. And with eminent sages who have highly controlled food-habits, as well. It is also refulgent with the self-denying Siddha-s, Carana-s, and with sages that are the brainchildren of Brahma, namely Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s. [3-35-14, 15]"
3-35-11,"With thousands of celestial maidens divine in their mien, namely apsara-s, who are prettified with divine ornaments and garlands, and who are also the experts in the methodical sex-games that seaside is pervaded. [3-35-16]"
3-35-12,"That seacoast is adored by the propitious wives of gods and frequented by the assemblages of gods who thrive upon ambrosia, and even patronised by demons that strive for ambrosia. [3-35-17]"
3-35-13,"It is spread with swans, ruddy-gees and frogs, and there the waterfowls are very noisy, and stones overlain on the coast are like lapis-gems, and with the ambience of ocean that whole delta is appearing smooth and sludgy. [3-35-18]"
3-35-14,"While Ravana, the brother of Kubera, is quickly transiting he saw everywhere the whitish and widish aircrafts belonging to the deified souls who acquired higher worlds, and from those aircrafts adorned with divine flowery tassels and piloted by the wish of their steersmen, instrumental and vocal music is resonating, and gandharva-s are singing and apsara-s are dancing in them. [3-35-19, 20]"
3-35-15,"Ravana proceeded while observing thousands of woodlands with sandalwood trees that are soothing and satisfying the sense of smell, and that oozed sweet-smelling resin at their bases. [3-35-21]"
3-35-16,"He also observed on his way the forests and woodlands containing the noteworthy aloe plants, Takkola trees, and the nutmeg trees that are with fruits and aromatic, as well. [3-35-22]"
3-35-17,"Also seen are the flowers of Tamaala trees, shrubberies of pepper, and heaps of desiccating pearl-oysters along the seashore. [3-35-23]"
3-35-18,"Thus, he saw the peaking boulders, like that the reefs of corals, and like that also at the mountains that have golden and silvern crests. [3-35-24]"
3-35-19,"On seeing the delightful, serene, and marvellous cascades, and cities that are abundant in wealth and agricultural produce, and abundant with gemlike womenfolk, and that are replete with elephants, horses, and chariots, Ravana proceeded further. [3-35-25, 26a]"
3-35-20,"Ravana observed the delta adjacent to seacoast of that kingly ocean to be uniform and smooth, while the light air breezing in there is soft for touch, thus it looked heavenly. [3-35-26b, 27a]"
3-35-21,"There Ravana also saw a banyan tree which in sheen is like a black-cloud, and the branches of which are stretching all over for a hundred yojana-s in length, and on which sages made their abode for practising ascesis. [3-35-27b, 28a]"
3-35-22,"This is the tree on the branch of which once highly mighty Divine Eagle Garuda swooped to perch, clawing an elephant and a mammoth tortoise, for the purpose of dining them out on that tree-branch. [3-35-28b, 29a]"
3-35-23,"While descending rapidly then that best bird among birds Garuda suddenly broke that tree&#39;s branch which is full with leaves, owing to the impact of his high impetuosity. [3-35-29b, 30a]"
3-35-24,"Adhering to that tree-branch there are eminent sages like, Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s, Aja-s, and even sages like Dhuumraa-s that thrive on fumes and smokes are there, and there they are collectively practising asceticism upside down while clasping branches with their legs. [3-35-30b, 31a]"
3-35-25,"For the sake of the grace of those sages Garuda took flight from that tree, grasping that broken tree-branch of a hundred yojana length along with those pendulous sages with his beak, and both of the elephant and tortoise with both of his claws. [3-35-31b, 32a]"
3-35-26,"That virtue-souled Garuda consumed the meat of his prays, namely the elephant and the giant tortoise with a single foot, and destroyed the province of tribesmen with the same broken tree branch, and thus that supreme bird Garuda gained an incomparable happiness in rescuing those great-sages. [3-35-32b, 33]"
3-35-27,"When his valour has become twice as much with that happiness that heedful Garuda indeed resolved to bring ambrosia from heaven. [3-35-34]"
3-35-28,"Smashing the guard of iron-grid completely and crashing the unbreakable diamond -like strongroom in which the ambrosia is safeguarded, then Garuda carried off ambrosia from the palace of Indra. [3-35-35]"
3-35-29,"Ravana on his way saw such a banyan tree named as Subhadra which is a much sought after tree for assemblages of great sages, and which betokens the deeds of that best-winged Garuda. [3-35-36]"
3-35-30,"On going to the other side of the lord of rivers, namely ocean, Ravana saw a pleasing hermitage in the sacred and scenic interior of the forest. [3-35-37]"
3-35-31,"At that place Ravana saw the demon named Maareecha, wearing jute-clothes and black deerskin and tufts of hairs, and the one with regulated diet. [3-35-38]"
3-35-32,"That demon Maareecha welcomed the king Ravana and customarily entertained him catering all the offerings that are beyond the scope of humans. [3-35-39]"
3-35-33,"On personally offering meals and drinking water, and venerating him properly Maareecha spoke this sentence to Ravana which is connotative of significance. [3-35-40]"
3-35-34,"Oh, king of the demons, is everything well with your Lanka? Oh, king, for what reason you have put in an appearance again, that too in a trice? [3-35-41]"
3-35-35,"When Maareecha spoke to him thus, that highly radiant and eloquent Ravana then afterwards spoke this sentence to Maareecha. [3-35-42]"
3-36-1,"Give attention to my words as I speak, oh, sire, Maareecha, I am an anguished one,and when I am in such an anguish you are the ultimate course to me, isn't so. Thus Ravana startedaddressing Maareecha. [3-36-1]"
3-36-2,"You are aware as to how my brother Khara, and the mighty armed Duushana, also mysister Shuurpanakha, and even the highly fiery demon and devourer of raw-flesh Trishira, and evennumerous other night-walking demons who are cocksure of hitting their targets have made Janasthaanaas their residency, and while residing there they put the sages of that great forest that tread arighteous path to torture, of course, all this as assigned by me. [3-36-2, 3, 4]"
3-36-3,"You are equally aware of the stationing fourteen thousand braving demons inJanasthaana, who are the followers of the wish of Khara, who are with fiendish exploits, and whoare the troublemakers to the sages of Dandaka forest or to the intruders therein, aren't you.[3-36-5]"
3-36-4,"But recently those great mighty demons that are the residents of Janasthaana,namely Khara and others, preparing themselves inordinately and wielding diverse weapons andassaulters, for their part had an encounter with Rama in a combat. [3-36-6, 7a]"
3-36-5,"With rancour tiding in him, and without making any scathing remark in the least,that Rama brought his bow into play with arrows in the van of the combat. [3-36-7b, 8a]"
3-36-6,"But that foot-soldier, that too, a human, has completely wiped out thosefourteen-thousand demons with flaring fieriness with his fierce arrows. [3-36-8b, 9a]"
3-36-7,"Khara is hewed down, Duushana is mowed down, and even Trishira is hacked down,thereof that Dandaka forest is rendered free from the fear of demons. [3-36-9b, 10a]"
3-36-8,"He who is put to flight by his infuriated father, and who came to Dandaka forestalong with his wife, that ignoble Kshatriya is the slaughterer of that demonic army of mine, as hislifespan is diminished. [3-36-10b, 11a]"
3-36-9,"He is out of character, brutal, firestorm, senseless, selfish, one with his sensesunconquered and righteousness discarded, and he is an unrighteous soul just delighting in thedisservice of all beings. [3-36-11b, 12a]"
3-36-10,"By whom my sister is disfigured stripping off her nose and ears, that too, withoutany enmity but just depending upon his own brawn, I would like to inveigle such a man's nympheanwife Seetha holding sway on her in Janasthaana, and in that matter I want you to be my aide inDandaka forest. [3-36-12b, 13, 14a]"
3-36-11,"Oh, highly powerful Maareecha, with you and with my brothers standing by my side asmy associates, I indeed care a damn for all of the gods if they are going to wage a war against me,therefore, oh, demon Maareecha, as you are capable of rendering aid you should indeed become myaide in this venture. [3-36-14b, 15]"
3-36-12,"In valour, war and verve there is none similar to you, you are a topmost stalwartin trickery, and a matchless expert in illusive-tricks. [3-36-16]"
3-36-13,"I have come nigh of you only for that reason, oh, nightwalker, and listen to thatdeed which you have to do in the course of helping me as I detail you. [3-36-17]"
3-36-14,"On becoming an astounding golden deer with silver dots, you move in front of Seethain the hermitage of that Rama. [3-36-18]"
3-36-15,"On seeing you in the shape of a deer, Seetha undoubtedly bids her husbandforthwith, and even Lakshmana, saying, 'lay hold of it.' [3-36-19]"
3-36-16,"Then on the diversion of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, I will comfortably andunimpededly abduct Seetha in that lonely place, as planet Rahu abducts the shine of moon.[3-36-20]"
3-36-17,"Thereafter Rama will be enervated by the abduction of his wife, and then surely andconveniently I wish to retaliate him if he is going to come up against me, for my inner-soul willbe firstly gratified with its volition, namely possessing Seetha. Thus Ravana requested Maareecha.[3-36-21]"
3-36-18,"On listening the very word of Rama that honest-souled Maareecha's mouth iscompletely dried up, and he is fully frightened. [3-36-22]"
3-36-19,"Wetting dried up lips with his tongue he has become goggle-eyed almost like anabout-to-die animal, and he agonisingly looked up at Ravana with winkless eyes. [3-36-23]"
3-36-20,"Maareecha's heart sank with scare as he is aware of Rama's valour when he was in thegreat forest of Tataka, thus suppliantly making palm-fold he started telling about factuality ofRama to Ravana, which is beneficial both to Ravana and to himself, as well, if only Ravana isheedful of it. [3-36-24]"
3-37-1,"On hearing that idea of the chief of demons Ravana in abducting Seetha, Maareecha, awell-informed one and an articulator spoke to the lord of demons in reply. [3-37-1]"
3-37-2,"It will always be easy to get people who talk pleasantly, oh, king, but it isimpossible to get them who talk judgementally and give suggestions that may be apparently insipid,but that are recuperative, more so, it is impossible to get listeners of such advises. [3-37-2]"
3-37-3,"Definitely you do not apperceive Rama who is decidedly dynamic and exaltedly adept,for you are impetuous and desultory in dealing with your spies, but that Rama is identical to thethunderous Mahendra and tempestuous Varuna, the Rain-god. [3-37-3]"
3-37-4,"Oh, boy, will there be safety to all demons on earth? Or, that highly enraged Ramawill render this world de-demonised! [3-37-4]"
3-37-5,"Has this Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, taken birth to end your life, or what! Andbecause of this Seetha will there be a great disaster, so to speak! [3-37-5]"
3-37-6,"Egocentric and rampant, such as you are, on acquiring you as her lord, will theCity of Lanka be doomed along with her demons, and you put together, or what! [3-37-6]"
3-37-7,"Any king of your like who is with a self-will, ill-will, ensorcelled by evil, andmalicious in intent, that king alone ruins his own city-state, his own people, even himself, as amatter of actual fact. [3-37-7]"
3-37-8,"Rama the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's happiness is completely forsaken by hisfather - no, he is not; there is unseemliness in him - no, not in the least; he is out of character- no; he is selfish - no; he is an ignoble Kshatriya - no, not at all; and he is neither a debasedone insofar as the merits of righteousness are concerned, nor he is atrocious towards livingbeings, for he takes delight in the welfare of all beings. [3-37-8, 9]"
3-37-9,"On seeing his father who is a proponent of truth, and whom Kaikeyi has outwitted,that virtue-souled Rama neatly decamped from Ayodhya saying that 'I will prove my father to be areal proponent of truth.' [3-37-10]"
3-37-10,"Discarding the kingdom and even royal-comforts Rama entered Dandaka forest only tofulfil the cherish of Kaikeyi, viz., kingdom for her son Bharata, and even that of Dasharatha,viz., to remain loyal to his promise to Kaikeyi. [3-37-11]"
3-37-11,"Rama is ruthless - no; an unscholarly one - no; unconquered are his senses - no;and oh, boy, it is unapt of you to speak of impalpable and unheard-of topics in this way.[3-37-12]"
3-37-12,"Rama is the embodiment of righteousness, he is an equable person with truthfulnessas his valour, and as with Indra to all gods he is the king of entire world. [3-37-13]"
3-37-13,"Rama's proper resplendence is protecting Vaidehi. How then you really wish toforcibly rob her off from Rama, as though wishing to rob the Sun of his resplendence. [3-37-14]"
3-37-14,"Arrows as it jets of fire, bow and sword as it firewood that fire called Rama willbe blazing in war, and it will be inapt of you to enter into such an uninfringeable fire,recklessly. [3-37-15]"
3-37-15,"With the bow stretched to his ear becoming a gaping mouth spouting flames, arrowsbecoming tongues of fire spewed forth from that flaming mouth, he that Rama the reified Terminatorwill become fierce and insufferable when he wields bow and arrows, and oh, dear boy Ravana, it willbe inapt of you to at once draw pretty nigh of such an annihilator of the armies of enemies, ondiscarding your kingdom, comforts and even the dear life of yours. [3-37-16, 17]"
3-37-16,"Which Rama's wife is Janaka's daughter that Rama is indeed with an inestimableresplendence, and it will be incapable of you to steal Seetha while such a Rama's bow safeguardsher in the forest, besides the firewall called his resplendence. [3-37-18]"
3-37-17,"That lady Seetha is his wife, dearest than the lives of that lion-chested lion-manRama, and in truth, she is avowed to follow him alone, in perpetuity. [3-37-19]"
3-37-18,"As the spire of blazing ritual fire cannot be abused, so also, she that curvaceousMaithili, the cherished wife of that dynamic Rama, is an impossibility for any abuse. [3-37-20]"
3-37-19,"Oh, king of demons, What is the result in making such a futile effort? If that Ramaglances at you in a given war that alone ends your life. [3-37-21]"
3-37-20,"If you cherish to take pleasure for a long time in your life, in your comforts andalso thus in your kingdom, which kingdom is highly impossible to achieve, do not do anythingunpleasant to Rama. [3-37-22]"
3-37-21,"Such as you are, you should firstly deliberate with all of your ministers that havea righteous bearing, duly keeping your brother Vibheeshana at the helm of affairs, and then youtake a decision on your own considering rights and wrongs of the case, and bearing in mind aboutyour own strengths and weakness, and even on making sure of Raghava's capability in its reality,and then it will be apt of you to take up befitting action that will be conducive to yourinterests. [3-37-24,25]"
3-37-22,"Oh, king of nightwalkers Ravana, I for myself deem that your confrontation withRama, the prince of Kosala, in a war is improper, and a better, befitting, and a reasonable one isthis advise of mine, to which you may listen further. [3-37-25]"
3-38-1,"At one time even I was on the rove around this earth, taking pride in my valour,bearing the strength of a thousand elephants, mountainous in my size and black-cloudlike in mysheen, wearing ear-knobs and a crown made out of refined gold, with a bludgeon as my weapon, andsuch as I was, I rambled Dandaka forest causing terror to the world, and eating the fleshes ofsages. Thus Maareecha started to narrate his experience with Rama. [3-38-1, 2]"
3-38-2,"The virtue-souled great-saint Vishvamitra who was highly scared of me, then ongoing to Dasharatha in person that great-saint spoke this to that lord of people. [3-38-3b, 4a]"
3-38-3," 'An awesome dismay has befallen owing to this Maareecha, oh, lord of peopleDasharatha, let Rama safeguard me becoming alert at the opportune time of the Vedic-ritual.[3-38-4b 5a]"
3-38-4,"When he is spoken in that way, then that virtue-souled king Dasharatha replied thatgreat-fortunate and great-saint Vishvamitra in this way. [3-38-5b, 6a]"
3-38-5," 'This boy Rama is less than twelve years in his age, unproficient in the use ofweapons, and if need be, whatever army of mine is there it will march on along with me instead ofRama. [3-38-6b, 7a]"
3-38-6," 'And having come in person with fourfold forces, oh eminent sage, I myself willeradicate that nightwalker whomever you indicate as an enemy of yours. So said Dasharatga toVishvamitra. [3-38-7b, 8a]"
3-38-7,"When the sage Vishvamitra is spoken thus, then he said to the king, 'No other forcein the world than Rama can counterbalance that demon. [3-38-8b, 9a]"
3-38-8," 'No doubt, you are a defender of gods in wars, and oh, king, the exploits you haveundertaken on behalf of gods are well-known in the triad of worlds. [3-38-9b, 10a]"
3-38-9," 'Maybe your army is a remarkable one, oh, enemy-inflamer, let it sit tight herealone, and even if this great resplendent one is still a boy he alone is competent to forestallthat Maareecha, hence oh, enemy-subjugator, let good betide you, I wish to take him alone alongwith me.' [3-38-10b, 11]"
3-38-10,"Thus that way on saying he that sage Vishvamitra returned to his own hermitagehighly gladdening to take the prince Rama along with him. [3-38-12]"
3-38-11,"Then in Dandaka forest Rama twingeing his amazing bow stayed nearby the sageVishvamitra who entered the vow of Vedic-ritual. [3-38-13]"
3-38-12,"At that time, yet unborn are the identities of adulthood like moustache on hisface, and that providential one was magnificent in looks with a peacock-blue complexion, wearing asingle cloth, locks of hair, and golden locket, and wielding a bow, and he was irradiating theDandaka forest with a radiating radiance of his own, and then he appeared like the just risenbaby-moon. [3-38-14, 15]"
3-38-13,"And I who was like a massive black-cloud, wearing golden ear-knobs, already aforceful one further reinforced with the boon of Brahma, I pridefully entered into the interior ofVishwamitra's hermitage. [3-38-16]"
3-38-14,"Rama quickly noticed me on my very entry with an uplifted weapon, and on seeing mehe unexcitedly strung bowstring to his bow. [3-38-17]"
3-38-15,"Unmindfully trivialising him as, 'this Raghava is just a boy,' I made haste and rantowards that Fire-altar of Vishvamitra. [3-38-18]"
3-38-16,"He then released an acute arrow that eliminates the enemy, and hit by it I amplunged into the ocean which was a hundred yojana-s off. [3-38-19]"
3-38-17,"That Rama did not wish to kill me then, and I am thus saved by that valiant one,oh, dear boy Ravana, but the thrust of Rama's arrow bewildered my animation and I was on my lastlegs. [3-38-20]"
3-38-18,"That way I who had been flung into the abyssal water of the ocean by him gainedconsciousness after a long time and proceeded towards the city of Lanka. [3-38-21]"
3-38-19,"At that time, that one with elementary knowledge in the use of weaponry, but whocan undertake deeds in an effortless manner, such a boy, such a Rama spared me, albeit killing themthat were my helpmates in that escapade. [3-38-22]"
3-38-20,"Thereby, if you wish to make for any confrontation with Rama, despite of myproscribing you, you will ruin yourself on getting a disastrous calamity. [3-38-23]"
3-38-21,"The demons are methodical in sporting and flirting, thus by their own conduct theyare also socialising and frolicking, and to them you derive distress and disaster. [3-38-24]"
3-38-22,"Dense with skyscrapers and palaces, and decorated with many a gemstone is that cityLanka, but you will see it completely shattered down, for the sake of that Maithili. [3-38-25]"
3-38-23,"Even if with uncommitted sins, the sinless will get ruined owing to theirinterdependence with other sinners, like the fish in a lake with snakes. [3-38-26]"
3-38-24,"Bedaubed with divine sandal-paste, beautified with divine ornaments are the limbsof the demons now, perchance you will be seeing them trampled out on ground for the blunder ofyours. [3-38-27]"
3-38-25,"Maybe, you will have to see the fleeing of the nightwalkers surviving after thecarnage in all ten directions, some abandoning their wives and some along with their wives, onlyfor lack of a protector. [3-38-28]"
3-38-26,"Without a doubt you will be seeing Lanka encircled with an enmesh of arrows,enfolded in the tongues of torches, while her buildings are utterly gutting down. [3-38-29]"
3-38-27,"Oh, king, there is no other sin that is outrageous and gravest than the dalliancewith another's wife and, besides, you already have a thousand wives, isn't so! [3-38-30]"
3-38-28,"Abide by your own wife and be delighted with her, oh, demon, safeguard your ownethnos, thus safeguard dignity, affluence, and kingdom of demons, thereby safeguard even your owndear life. [3-38-31]"
3-38-29,"If you desire to take pleasure with your beautiful wives and with your friend'scircles for a long time, do not do anything undesirable to Rama. [3-38-32]"
3-38-30,"If you wish to intimidate Seetha aggressively despite of my considerable preventingin all my good-heartedness towards you, then your army will fade away, and you with your kinsfolkwill emigrate to the world of Yama, the Terminator, for your life will be taken away by the arrowof Rama. Thus, Maareecha spoke to Ravana. [3-38-33]"
3-39-1,"Thus I was somehow released by him in a confrontation then in his teens. Now youmay also listen to what has happened later in his adulthood. Thus Maareecha continued his adviseto Ravana. [4-39-1]"
3-39-2,"Though Rama hit me previously in such a way, I unabashedly entered Dandaka foresttogether with two more demons who were in the guise of animals. [4-39-2]"
3-39-3,"On becoming a gigantic carnivorous animal with a torching tongue, incisive teethand excruciating horns, and with an extraordinary energy, I was on the rove in Dandaka forest whilegetting at Rama. [4-39-3]"
3-39-4,"I moved about Dandaka forest, oh, Ravana, in an extremely horrible aspect ofanimal, utterly brutalising the sages at ritual-altars, holy bathing places and under the trees ofreligious sanctuaries while reaching Rama. [4-39-4]"
3-39-5,"I have proceeded to Rama killing saints in Dandaka forest who are the treaders insaintliness, and drinking off their blood and feasting on their flesh. [4-39-5]"
3-39-6,"On becoming such a brutal animal I have been eating the flesh of sages, frighteningthe forest dwellers, and in that way I rambled in Dandaka forest besotted with blood-drinking whilereaching Rama. [4-39-6]"
3-39-7,"While I was wandering in Dandaka forest as an abuser of virtue, then I reached Ramawho by then has assumed the rectitude befitting to a saint, and I even reached the great-fortunateVaidehi and top-speeded-chariot-rider Lakshmana. [4-39-7, 8a]"
3-39-8,"I was in the shape of an animal with incisive horns. Such as I was I recollected myearlier grudge against that great mighty Rama who takes delight in the welfare of all being, who bythen was santlike on a regulated diet and abiding in the forest, whereby I presumed him to be merehermit. In that way, I was very extremely infuriated to recollect his earlier assault on me, and Iindiscriminately dashed towards him, only to kill him, completely disregarding his other faculties.[4-39-8b, 9, 10]"
3-39-9,"Stringing out his highly magnificent bow Rama then released three excruciating andenemy eliminating arrows which in their egress match the Air-god and the Divine-Eagle Garuda.[4-39-11]"
3-39-10,"All those three thunderbolt like arrows that have only blood for their board,acutely bent at barbs, and that are highly horrendous have come at us in a coordinated manner.[4-39-12]"
3-39-11,"As I have earlier seen the fear caused by his arrow I am in the know of Rama'svalour, hence I retreated from there trickily and gingerly, but the other two demons were killed.[4-39-13]"
3-39-12,"When I was somehow exempted by the arrow of Rama I regained lifespan, and when thatarrow made me to renounce everything like a monk and fled me to this place, the other side of oceanto where you came by your aircraft, here I am living here in a yogic way, self-collectedly like anascetic. [4-39-14]"
3-39-13,"From then on wards, I am indeed descrying Rama at this tree and at that tree,dressed in jute-cloths and black deerskin, and handling his bow like the Terminator handling atether. [4-39-15]"
3-39-14,"Given to fright I even visualise thousands Rama-s, and whole this forest isreflecting to me as one entity of Rama. [4-39-16]"
3-39-15,"Even at a place void of people I am envisaging Rama alone, and oh, king of demons,even if he enters my dream, in fact, I am jolting up and swooning. [4-39-17]"
3-39-16,"Oh, Ravana, appalled of Rama the names starting with the syllable &#39;<em>ra</em>' like<em>ratna</em>-s, <em>ratha</em>-s, viz., gemstones, chariots are appalling to me, including your name, that startswith a '<em>ra</em>....' [4-39-18]"
3-39-17,"I am well-acquainted with his efficacy, and a war with him will be an unfair thingfor you, for that Raghu's descendant can in fact kill either Emperor Bali or Namuchi, the demon.[4-39-19]"
3-39-18,"You may either wage a war with Rama if you wish to avenge the killings of Khara andothers, or forgive and forget that Rama agreeing to my suggestions, but do not broach the topic ofRama with me if you wish to see me alive. [4-39-20]"
3-39-19,"In the world many of the sagacious and reasonable people that are the practisers ofrighteousness are utterly ruined along with their kith and kin, just by the misdeeds of others.[4-39-21]"
3-39-20,"Such a saintly one as I am, I am bound to ruin by other's misdeeds, hence you dowhatever that is fair to you, but I am not the one to simply take after you. [4-39-22]"
3-39-21,"Definitely Rama is the one with exceptional resplendence, exemplary courage andextraordinary power, and for sure, he becomes an eradicator of the world of demons. [4-39-23]"
3-39-22,"If Khara positioned in Janasthaana has firstly overstepped his bounds and attackedRama, that too owing to Shuurpanakha, and if Rama of uncomplicated actions has eliminated Khara inself-defence, what really is the transgression of Rama in that matter, you tell of that in thefinal analysis. [4-39-24]"
3-39-23,"I am saying this word of advise as I am ambitious of the wellbeing of my kinsmenthrough you, and if this is disagreeable to you, you will have to deliver up your life in aconfrontation with Rama along with the lives of your kinsmen, perishing at the linearlyaccelerating arrows of Rama. [4-39-25]"
3-40-1,"When Maareecha spoke those acceptable and equitable words, Ravana rejected them likea person with a death wish rejects medicament. [3-40-1]"
3-40-2,"Ushered by the Terminator the king of demons Ravana, uncouthly spoke theseunbefitting words to Maareecha who had been speaking conducive and beneficial words of advise.[3-40-2]"
3-40-3,"All these meaningless words that are being said to me are decidedly worthless, ineffect, like the seeds seeded in wastelands. [3-40-3]"
3-40-4,"But it is impossible to scare me away from a war with that iniquitous and imprudentRama, that too, from a human being, with these words of yours. [3-40-4]"
3-40-5,"He who bolted off to forest in a single-foot on hearing the artless words of awoman, forfeiting his kingdom, friends and relatives, and even his mother, likewise his father too,you cannot scare me away from such a Rama. [3-40-5]"
3-40-6,"But his wife Seetha who is dearer to him more than his lives is certainly seizableby me in association with you, as that Rama had purposelessly killed Khara in a war. [3-40-6]"
3-40-7,"In this way my thinking is decided and it is lingering on in my heart, and it isimpossible to roll back my mind or heart even for Indra coming along with gods and demons.[3-40-7]"
3-40-8,"If you are asked about the credits or discredits, or either of the danger orideation of the deed for determining its modus operandi, it will be apt of you to talk like this,but I did not seek any viewpoints of yours. [3-40-8]"
3-40-9,"Even if someone is asked, and if he desires his own welfare, then he has to submithis opinion to the king suppliantly upraising his palm-fold, may he be an intellectual, or anastute adviser. [3-40-9]"
3-40-10,"The king being lord of the land is to be addressed preceded with gentility, withauspicious and beneficial words that do not contradict the interests of that lord, more so, theyshall be inclusive of etiquette. [3-40-10]"
3-40-11,"Or else, oh, Maareecha, even if a beneficial word is said, but if it is said withreprehension it will not gladden that king who insists upon honour, for that said word isdishonourable, let alone reprehension. [3-40-11]"
3-40-12,"The kings with infinite vigour embody five constituents forces of Fire, Moon, Rain,Terminator, and that of Indra, the Administrator of Natural Forces. [3-40-12]"
3-40-13,"Oh, nightwalker, thus the kings being great-souls personify the sultriness of Fire,sternness of Indra, softness of Moon, suppleness of Rain, and harshness of Terminator, andtherefore in all situations they are respectable and reverential. [3-40-13, 14a]"
3-40-14,"But you are ill-advisedly babbling with me in this way, incognizant of rectitudeand holding on to your obsession, and wishing ill of me, as I am on your doorstep. [3-40-14b,15a]"
3-40-15,"Oh, demon, I did not ask the rights and wrongs concerning me, nor that which isexpedient for me, but oh, demon of untold bravery, I have said this much to you. [3-40-15]"
3-40-16," 'It will be apt of you to proffer a helping hand in this deed.' This much I saidto you. And such as you are you may now listen to that task which you have to undertake during thecourse of your assistance as I detail it to you. [3-40-16]"
3-40-17,"On becoming an amazing silver-potted golden deer you move in front of Seetha in thehermitage of Rama, and on verily alluring Vaidehi you can go away as you like. [3-40-17, 18 ]"
3-40-18,"On seeing you as a wholly illusory golden deer curiosity arises in Vaidehi, andindeed she tells Rama, 'bring that one quickly.' [3-40-19]"
3-40-19,"Further, on Rama's coming out of his hermitage you go distantly and blurt out inthis way, 'ha Seetha' and even as, 'ha, Lakshmana,' mimicking Rama's voice. [3-40-20]"
3-40-20,"On hearing that, and further hastened by Seetha, even Soumitri apprehensivelyfollows the path of Rama in all his fondness for Rama. [3-40-21]"
3-40-21,"When Rama is diverted from hermitage, Lakshmana as well, I will carry off Vaidehieffortlessly like the Thousand-eyed Indra who once carried off Sachi Devi. [3-40-22]"
3-40-22,"Oh, demon, on carrying out this stint in this manner you may go as you like, and toyou oh, Maareecha with solemn vows, I will grant half of my kingdom. [3-40-23]"
3-40-23,"Hence, oh, gentle one, get going on a trouble-free path for the easy achievement ofthe task, and I for myself will follow you to Dandaka forest along with the chariot. [3-40-24]"
3-40-24,"My goal will be achieved just by misleading Raghava, and by gaining Seetha withouta conflict, then I will proceed to Lanka along with you. [3-40-25]"
3-40-25,"If you are not going to do so, oh, Maareecha, for sure I will kill you now itself.I will get my work done through you even under duress, and indeed, any subject setting against hisking will never succeed safely. [3-40-26]"
3-40-26,"Your life may be indefinite on reaching Rama, but your death is surely definite nowas you are conflicting with me. Hence, keeping all this in view you come to a conclusion that wouldbe conducive to your interests, and whatever desirable to you let it be done in that way.  ThusRavana spoke to Maareecha. [3-40-27]"
3-41-1,"When Ravana perversely ordered that way in all his kingliness, Maareecha spoke thesewords caustically and frankly to that king of demons. [3-41-1]"
3-41-2,"Oh, night-walker, by which evildoer this thought, which is self-ruinous to you,along with your progeny, kingdom and ministers put together, is taught to you? [3-41-2]"
3-41-3,"Who is that reprobate unhappy with such a happy one like you, and oh, king, by whomthis door of demise is ingeniously shown to you? [3-41-3]"
3-41-4,"It is very clear, oh, night-walker, that your rivals with skimpy might are aspiringthat you should be completely ruined coming into conflict with more mighty Rama. [3-41-4]"
3-41-5,"He who wishes you to get ruined by your undertaking a self-made destruction is ascoundrel with a pernicious intent, as such, by whom you are counselled to do this? [3-41-5]"
3-41-6,"Your ministers are not curbing you anywise when you scramble on a high road toself-ruination, hence they are indeed to be sentenced to death, but they are not being executed fortheir dereliction. [3-41-6]"
3-41-7,"Veracious ministers have to restrain a self-willed king when he relies on awrong-route, isn't it. But you are unrestrained by your ministers though you are self-willed andthough you are taking a wrong-route. [3-41-7]"
3-41-8,"Oh, best conqueror Ravana, probity, prosperity and pleasures, and even thepopularity of the ministers, oh, night-walker, are achieved at the beneficence of their master.[3-41-8]"
3-41-9,"Contrariwise, oh, Ravana, all that beneficence of the king to ministers becomesfutile when the king behaves perversely, and even the others, namely the subjects of kingdom, willderive distress by the negative virtue of their master. [3-41-9]"
3-41-10,"The king alone is the root cause for probity and prosperity, isn't it. Therefore,oh, best prosperous one, in all situations the kings are to be safeguarded from the ill effects ofinfluences. [3-41-10]"
3-41-11,"It is impossible to govern kingdom, oh, demon, the night-walker, for a king withacridity, with hostility, or with immorality. [3-41-11]"
3-41-12,"The ministers with drastic notions will indeed fall apart together with their king,like a chariot that gets ramshackled together with it charioteer on a rough road, though it ishieing with galloping horses but badly controlled by that slothful charioteer. [3-41-12]"
3-41-13,"In the world many saintly beings that are high-minded and pursuers of ethicalityare completely ruined together with their kinsmen owing to the misdeeds of others. [3-41-13]"
3-41-14,"Oh, Ravana, the subjects do not flourish while a lord with contrariety andcoerciveness safeguards them, just like goats guarded by a fox. [3-41-14]"
3-41-15,"All those demons will definitely ruin, oh, Ravana, to whom you are the acrimoniousand malicious king with unconquered senses, though you have conquered the heaven. [3-41-15]"
3-41-16,"What is the use of laming for myself as I foregathered this ghastly situation as incrow-palm-tree syndrome, but in this issue you alone are regrettable, for you are gong tocompletely ruin along with your military. [3-41-16]"
3-41-17,"That Rama will soon kill you after killing me, and I will be dying at the hand ofmy enemy rather than at the hand of my own clansman like you, whereby the purpose of my life willbe brought to an end. [3-41-17]"
3-41-18,"Know that I am killed just when Rama notices me, and know that you are also killedalong with your kinsmen just when you steal Seetha. [3-41-18]"
3-41-19,"If you are going to bring Seetha from their hermitage on going there with me, thenyou will not be there, I will not be there, Lanka will not be there, the demons will not be there.[3-41-19]"
3-41-20,"As a desirer of your welfare I am dissuading you, oh, night-walker, but you mayfeel that this word of mine is unpleasant to you. People on diminishing lifetime will be similar tocorpses and a corpse cannot take in the expedient spoken by considerate confidants, isn't so.[3-41-20]"
3-42-1,"Maareecha though curtly said in that way, then afraid of the king of night-walkershe became self-pitying, and said to Ravana, 'let us go.' [3-42-1]"
3-42-2,"If he who wields a bow, arrows and a sword, and who brandishes a weapon to onlykill me happens to see me again, deem my life is verily lost, without his shooting any arrow.[3-42-2]"
3-42-3,"None can really make so bold at Rama to reappear with life, isn't it. What isappearing before you is the reflected image of mine, as I am already slain by the wand of Yama, theTerminator, the moment I conceded to your demand."
3-42-4,"When you are spiteful, oh, boy, indeed what can I possibly do otherwise, oh,night-walker, thither I go, may good betide you. So said Maareecha to Ravana. [3-42-4]"
3-42-5,"By that word of Maareecha demon Ravana is very much gladdened and he spoke thissentence tightly hugging him. [3-42-5]"
3-42-6,"This word of yours shows your obduracy for you are abiding under the control of mydictate, and though you were a different night-walker earlier, henceforth you are really the goodold Maareecha. [3-42-6]"
3-42-7,"Then you promptly emplane this sky-flying chariot which is yoked with ghost-facedmules and adorned with gems along with me. [3-42-7]"
3-42-8,"On deluding Vaidehi it is apt of you to go as you please, and I will bring thatSeetha of Mithila, however defiant it might be. Thus Ravana said to Maareecha. [3-42-8]"
3-42-9,"Tataka's son Maareecha said ""All right"" to Ravana, and then both Ravana andMaareecha mounted the chariot as they would emplane an aircraft and swiftly journeyed from thesurroundings of Maareecha's hermitage. [3-42-9, 10a]"
3-42-10,"While looking at the seaports and forests, also at all the mountains and rivers,even at the cities and provinces en route they proceeded. [3-42-10b, 11a]"
3-42-11,"On reaching Dandaka forest along with Maareecha the king of demons Ravana has thenseen the hermitage of Raghava. [3-42-11b, 12a]"
3-42-12,"Alighting the chariot that is decorated with golden ornaments Ravana then spoke thissentence to Maareecha taking his hand into his. [3-42-12b, 13a]"
3-42-13,"This one which we are seeing and which is surrounded with banana plants is thethreshold of Rama's hermitage, and -`----oh, friend, the purpose for which we came here let it beeffectuated promptly. Thus Ravana hastened Maareecha. [3-42-13b, 14a]"
3-42-14,"And on hearing Ravana's words demon Maareecha then became a deer and indeed ambledfreely in the frontage of Rama's hermitage. [3-42-14b, 15a]"
3-42-15,"Adopting the form of a gorgeous deer which is superbly amazing just by itsappearance, whose tips of antlers are in the hue of best sapphires, and whose face is whitish atsome places and not so whitish at other in its look, he became a Golden Deer and moved thereabout.[3-42-15b, 16a]"
3-42-16,"One of its cheeks in the shade of a reddish-lotus while the other in the hue of abluish-lotus, one of its ears is in the hue of bloomed blue-lotus while the other is in the shadeof a sapphire, while the shine of its stomach is like that of a best blue-diamond,Indra-niila-maNi, and with a little upraised neck that deer has moved about there. [3-42-16b,17a]"
3-42-17,"One flank is shining whitish like Madhuka flowers and the other is similar to theroseate fibrils of lotuses, while its hooves are similar to the gemstone lapis, calves thin, andthus with very well cohered limbs that deer moved about there. [3-42-17b, 18a]"
3-42-18,"With an upraised tail that shone forth in a tinge equal to the weapon of Indra,namely Rainbow, and with a complexion that is lustrous and dappled with many diverse gemlikedapples, that deer moved thereabout with a heart-stealing aura. [3-42-18b, 19a]"
3-42-19,"Thus that demon Maareecha emerged like a highly splendorous and fascinating deer ina wink highly irradiating those woodlands, and the threshold of Rama's hermitage in particular.[3-42-19b, 20a]"
3-42-20,"Adopting such an exquisite and heart-stealing form which is amazingly dappled withthe colours of diverse ores, that demon ambled all over there freely with the bearing of a realdeer in order that Vaidehi might be deluded, and he moved forward onto the pastures. [3-42-2b,21]"
3-42-21,"And with hundreds of silvery stipples of body he became an astonishing deer withpleasant looks and indeed moved chewing new grass-blades of trees. [3-42-22]"
3-42-22,"That Golden Deer has gone into the boscages of banana plants, and moved here andthere around Karnikara trees, and then resorted to a place which is within the eyeshot of Seetha.[3-42-23]"
3-42-23,"With an odd lotus like hind-side that astounding deer is verily scintillating, andit milled around the surroundings in the threshold of Rama's hermitage according to its owndelight. [3-42-24]"
3-42-24,"That excellent deer beats a retreat and again returns, and meanders thus time andagain, and turns its tail for sometime only to return once again very playfully. [3-42-25]"
3-42-25,"Again gambolling everywhere it sits somewhere on the ground, then, on coming to thethreshold of hermitage it goes towards herds of deer. [3-42-26]"
3-42-26,"That demon who has gone into the deer-hood has gone after some herd of deer. But hereturned again though that herd followed him wanting to fraternise, in order that he shall remainperceptible to Seetha, and he whirligiged in amusing circles while leaping and bounding to and fromthat herd of deer. [3-42-27, 28a]"
3-42-27,"All the other animals moving in that forest on seeing this demon-deer with theirnecks up have come close to it, and on smelling it well they are running away to all the tendirections noticing it as a demon turned into a deer. [3-42-28b, 29a]"
3-42-28,"Even that demon in the deer's semblance Maareecha, though indulged in killing thoseforest animals, and though the other animals are touching him, he is not killing and eating themindulgently, only for the reason of camouflaging his present nature of demon-hood. [3-42-29b,30a]"
3-42-29,"What is more, Vaidehi with her felicitous eyes came towards trees yearning forplucking the flowers in the same instant. [3-42-30b, 31a]"
3-42-30,"And she with her inebriating glances and delightful visage moved there about whileplucking flowers of Karnikaara, Ashoka, and of Mango trees. [3-42-31b, 32a]"
3-42-31,"That select lady who is unmeet for forest life beheld that deer which is completelygemlike and whose limbs are surprising as though studded with pearls and gems. [3-42-32b, 33a]"
3-42-32,"And she that Seetha goggled the Golden Deer with a wide-eyed astonishment, whichdeer has pretty lips and teeth, hair resembling silver and copper ores, and she indeed gazed at itwith an affinity for wildlife. [3-42-33b, 34a]"
3-42-33,"On seeing Rama's wife Seetha that highly phantasmal deer too then moved there aboutas though to scintillate that woodland. [3-42-34b, 35a]"
3-42-34,"To see such a deer which is hitherto unseen, and which is as though studded withnumerous gems, the daughter of Janaka, Seetha, went in to an intense wonderment. [3-42-35b, c]"
3-43-1,"That slender-waisted Seetha whose limbs are flawless, whose complexion is like purified gold, and who is presently culling flowers is highly gladdened to observe the Golden Deer that is brightened in one flank with the colour of gold and the other is silvery, and she shouted for attention of her husband, and even that of Lakshmana who is presently weaponed. [3-43-1, 2]"
3-43-2,"Oh, noble prince, come here, thus she called her husband and peered at the deer, and again she called, really come with your younger brother quickly, and again gazed at the deer, and thus she oftentimes called and oftentimes saw the deer fondly. [3-43-3]"
3-43-3,"Those manly lions Rama and Lakshmana thus bidden by Vaidehi came there exploring that place and then they saw that Golden Deer. [3-43-4]"
3-43-4,"But Lakshmana became incredulous on seeing it and said to Rama, I believe this deer to be that Maareecha, the demon. [3-43-5]"
3-43-5,"Oh, Rama, when kings engaged in hunting games were delightedly moving in the forest, this Maareecha killed many of them resorting to many disguises, for he is a guise-changer by his wish. [3-43-6]"
3-43-6,"Maareecha is an expert in many wiles and he has now assumed the form of this Golden-Deer, oh, manly lion, which is not more than the scintillating city of Gandharva-s, a city of wiles, which any trickster can create to make-believe. [3-43-7]"
3-43-7,"Oh, Raghava, this kind of amazing animal with gemlike dapples is nonexistent in the world, isn&#39;t it. Hence, oh, lord of the world, this is truly a phantasm. No doubt about it. So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-43-8]"
3-43-8,"While Lakshmana of Kakutstha-s is speaking thus, she who is self-satisfied as her heart is conjured by the cozenage, such a Seetha of a toothy smile deterred him and spoke. [3-43-9]"
3-43-9,"Oh, nobleman&#39;s son, that delightful deer is stealing my heart, oh, dextrous one, bring it round, it will be our plaything. [3-43-10]"
3-43-10,"Here in the threshold of our hermitage many animals with adorable manifestation are moving about in flocks and herds, say Caamara deer, like that Srimara deer. [3-43-11]"
3-43-11,"Also the animals that are excellent in their form, say monkeys, are moving here. Likewise herds of Kinnara deer, spotted-deer, and even bears of great-might are freely moving here. [3-43-12]"
3-43-12,"As to how this extraordinary deer is appearing, oh, king, by way of its brilliance, tameness, or by the lustre of its skin, I have not so far seen any coequal to this. [3-43-13]"
3-43-13,"Diversely coloured, amazingly limbed, and spotted with gemlike dapples it is shining forth like a deer that is completely gemmy, and while nonchalantly moving before me it is enlivening the forest like the moon. [3-43-14]"
3-43-14,"Ah, what a form, ah, what a brilliance, what a beautiful bleat! This amazingly limbed deer is wonderful, and this is stealing my heart, as it were. [3-43-15]"
3-43-15,"It will be surprising if this deer draws into your capture alive and well, as it creates astonishment to one and all. [3-43-16]"
3-43-16,"When we return to kingdom on completing our dwelling in forest this deer becomes a masterpiece in palace-chambers for us. [3-43-17]"
3-43-17,"Oh, lord, the form of this deer creates an excellent jubilation to Bharata, to you the son of the nobleman, to my mothers-in-law, and also to me in palace-chambers. [3-43-18]"
3-43-18,"Else if that best deer does not come into you capture while alive, oh tigerly-man, at the least its gorgeous deerskin will be remnant of it. [3-43-19]"
3-43-19,"I wish to sit along with you on its golden deerskin, overlaying it on a seat of tender darbha grass-blades, in case the deer is felled. [3-43-20]"
3-43-20,"Tradition says that this sort of unruly self-seeking is unbefitting to women, yet that deer&#39;s beautiful body is inducing curiosity in me. Seetha said so to Rama and remained waiting for his reply. [3-43-21]"
3-43-21,"As for that deer&#39;s horns they vie with excellent sapphires, its golden coat with the glitter of tender sun, and its ambience with silver spots on coat with a milk way containing twinkling stars, and by that reason even Raghava&#39;s heart is awestruck when he saw it. [3-43-22, 23a]"
3-43-22,"In this way, hearing the words of Seetha and observing that wondrous deer Raghava is also amused by its form, and even motivated by Seetha in fetching it, he delightedly spoke this word to his brother Lakshmana. [3-43-23b, 24]"
3-43-23,"Lakshmana, behold this enthusiastic delight of Vaidehi. Oh, Soumitri, presently no other deer indeed with such an excellent form exists in this forest. Or else, does it exist in Nandana Gardens of Indra - no, it cannot be there; in the adjoins of Caitraratha Gardens of Kubera - no, it will not be there, then how can there be some deer on earth which is similar to this! [3-43-25, 26]"
3-43-24,"Amazing are its hairlines with hair upturned at some places and down-turned at other, and the golden spots embedded on the coat of the deer are glittery. [3-43-27]"
3-43-25,"See at its tongue that is exserting from its mouth while it is yawning, which is similar to the flaring tongue of fire and to the lightning from a cloud. [3-43-28]"
3-43-26,"Its face is like a mug made up of sapphires, its paunch is pearly and conchoidal, and whose heart is it that will not lured for this deer with an inexplicable beauty. [3-43-29]"
3-43-27,"On seeing at this astounding look of the deer which is golden in glitter and bejewelled numerously as it were, whose heart is it that will not be transported into astonishment. [3-43-30]"
3-43-28,"Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery. [3-43-31]"
3-43-29,"And exerting themselves in great forests they by far amass forest produce, ores, jewels, gemstones and the gravel of gold. [3-43-32]"
3-43-30,"Everything of that wealth from forest produce will be filling the treasuries of kings, like the speculated objects filling the entire treasury of Shukra just by his thinking of them in his mind. [3-43-33]"
3-43-31,"The financial experts and the other financially well-off people say that with which aspirational activity an aspirant unhesitatingly scurries and achieves it, that achieved target alone is lauded to be worthwhile, or, as real wealth. [3-43-34]"
3-43-32,"This comely Vaidehi will be sitting on that invaluable golden skin of that gem of a deer along with me. [3-43-35]"
3-43-33,"I think the skin of Kadali deer, or of Priyaki deer, or of Praveni deer, or as a matter of fact the skins of best breed of deer or sheep will not be match to the deerskin of this deer, insofar as the soft-touch is concerned. [3-43-36]"
3-43-34,"Only two divine deer are there, this magnificent deer on earth, and the other that moves in skies remaining in stellar region. [3-43-37]"
3-43-35,"You are telling me that &#39;this is the wizardry of the demon.&#39; Even then, Lakshmana, if this results in that way as a demon&#39;s wizardry, my duty also results in the elimination of that deer. [3-43-38]"
3-43-36,"If this deer is Maareecha, this heinous and vicious-souled demon has indeed tortured many eminent sages earlier when was on the prowl in the forests, thus he is eliminable. [3-43-39]"
3-43-37,"He rebelliously killed many kings who are excellent archers while they were in hunting games, at least for that reason this bestial monster is eradicable. [3-43-40]"
3-43-38,"Demon Vaataapi who held ascetics in contempt was here earlier, and staying in the stomachs of Brahmans he used to come out by ripping their stomachs open and thus he was killing Brahmans, like a mare-calf killing its own mother at its time of birth by ripping the womb of its own mother. [3-43-41]"
3-43-39,"On one occasion after some time, that Vaataapi avariciously obtained that great-saint and the one who is endowed with effulgent, namely Agastya, as an eatable, but actually that demon has became an eatable to the sage. [3-43-42]"
3-43-40,"On observing the demon Vaataapi who is trying to assume his original form of demon in order to come out of his stomach, that godly saint Agastya spoke this to Vaataapi with a scornful smile. [3-43-43]"
3-43-41," &#39;Oh, Vaataapi, you have irreverently eradicated the best Brahmans in this world owing to your might, therefore I have assimilated you.&#39; So said sage Agastya to Vaataapi. [3-43-44]"
3-43-42,"Lakshmana, such a demon who is like Vaataapi will not be there any more. He who disregards someone of my kind, who always abides in righteousness and who is self-controlled, such a demon will be eliminated as sage Agastya has eliminated demon Vaataapi, if that demon happens to get at me. [3-43-45, 46a]"
3-43-43,"Oh, Lakshmana, the descendent of Raghu, you stay here in all preparedness and guard Maithili steadfastly, whatever enterprise of ours is there that is founded in her. [3-43-46b, 47a]"
3-43-44,"I wish to catch this deer, Soumitri, if not I will kill it, and I will be going forthwith to fetch the deer. [3-43-47b, 48a]"
3-43-45,"Lakshmana, see how Vaidehi&#39;s percept is overtaken by deerskin. Indeed by the strangeness of its skin that deer must be a mysterious being, hence, it will not survive now. [3-43-48]"
3-43-46,"Oh, Lakshmana, apply yourself vigilantly while staying in hermitage along with Seetha. So soon as I go I will be felling that spotted deer with one arrow and returning quickly. [3-43-49b, 50]"
3-43-47,"Oh, Lakshmana, you be here taking care of Maithili along with the forthright, formidable and fatherly bird Jatayu, and be watchful and suspicious from everywhere and every split-second. Thus Rama spoke to Lakshmana and started to go after the deer [3-43-51]"
3-44-1,"Rama, the great-resplendent scion of Raghu, on instructing his brother Lakshmana inthat way securely fastened his sword with golden handle to his waist. [3-44-1]"
3-44-2,"Rama whose valour is escalating then took his own insignia, the three-way arched bowcalled <font color=""#B3003A"">kodanDa</font>, and fastened two quivers and proceeded. [3-44-2]"
3-44-3,"On peering at the peerless one among kings, namely Rama, who is indeed coming downon him, that Golden Deer disappeared as if with fear and even to beguile him, and again it cameinto clear visibility. And Rama speedily spurted to that place from where the Golden Deer hasfirstly disappeared with securely grit sword and firmly handled bow. [3-44-3]"
3-44-4,"Rama the wielder of bow kept on beholding that Golden Deer which is observing himover and over and running away into deep of the forest. In the next moment he has seen it right infront of him as though effulgent with its marvellous form. At times he has seen it running away asthough to circumvent the fall of arrow, and at times stopping only to tantalise him. Sometimes itappeared to be springing as though to skies in very highly perplexity of wariness. It isdisappearing somewhere in the thickets of forest, and it is putting in an appearance elsewhere inthose thickets, like the autumnal orb of the moon under the fly front of splintered clouds.[3-44-4b, 5, 6, 7a]"
3-44-5,"In a wink Rama could proximately see that Maareecha who transformed himself into theGolden Deer, and again in a flash he appeared distantly. Thus that deer/demon has drawn off Raghavavery far from his hermitage in this hide and seek game. [3-44-7b, 8]"
3-44-6,"Rama of Kakutstha is incensed as its form is spellbinding but its capture slippery,and then verily tired as he is he stayed on a pasture taking shelter of a tree shade. [3-44-9]"
3-44-7,"Nightwalker Maareecha has further maddened Rama in the guise of Golden Deer byreappearing in his close-by, surrounded with other animals of the forest. [3-44-10]"
3-44-8,"Again on seeing Rama who is stalking his catch that deer ran towards him as thoughto impress with its guilelessness, and just at that moment it vanished again as if with extremefear. [3-44-11]"
3-44-9,"Then that deer has again emerged out of the thick of trees, and on spotting it thegreat-resplendent Rama has firmed up his decision to fell it. [3-44-12]"
3-44-10,"At that instant Raghava became highly infuriated and unholstered a holocaustic,enemy-subjugating arrow that is similar to the flare of the sun, tautening it on his very sturdybow that forceful Rama forcefully outstretched the bowstring with arrow targeting the Golden Deeralone, and released that fierily blazing arrow-missile which is carefully created by Brahma andwhich is hissing like a snake. [3-44-13, 14, 15a]"
3-44-11,"On very profoundly impaling the body of deer's form that superb arrow which issimilar to a thunderbolt has severed the heart of Maareecha in the core of deer's body. [3-44-15b,16a]"
3-44-12,"Then Maareecha is highly frenzied as his lifespan is minimised, blared a blaringshriek, vaulted up to a height of palm-tree, and fell down onto the ground. [3-44-16b, 17a]"
3-44-13,"Maareecha on his part abandoned the body of Golden Deer when he is dying. Butremembering the words of Ravana that demon gave a thought, 'how best will Seetha hasten Lakshmanato this place, and how best Ravana can abduct Seetha in a place void of people.' [3-44-17b, 18]"
3-44-14,"Perceptive of the time that chanced bearing his death, and wishful of the death ofRavana too, then made a voice that is a soundalike to Raghava's voice and yelled 'ha, Seetha...'also thus 'ha Lakshmana...' [3-44-19]"
3-44-15,"When Rama's incomparable arrow has indeed shattered his crucial organ, namely theheart, in a downright manner, then Maareecha assumed a very massive physique of a demon, abandoningthe form of Golden Deer. [3-44-20, 21a]"
3-44-16,"On seeing that demon with a fiendish look, who has fallen to earth with limbssteeped in blood, and who is weltering on the surface of earth, Rama emotionally took flight toSeetha reminiscing Lakshmana's words. [3-44-21b, 22]"
3-44-17,"This is the trickery of Maareecha which Lakshmana vouchsafed earlier, that hasindeed happened in that way alone, and the one whom I have killed now is none other than Maareecha.[3-44-23]"
3-44-18,"This demon died while crying out with a blatant voice 'ha, Seetha... ha,Lakshmana...' And on hearing this how Seetha will be? And what will be the plight of dextrousLakshmana? Thus on thinking over them that righteous-souled Rama remained in a hair-raisingpredicament. [3-44-24]"
3-44-19,"On killing that demon in the form of Golden Deer, and also on hearing his yelling,Rama is ensorcelled with a frantic fear caused by his own gloom. [3-44-26]"
3-44-20,"Raghava then on killing another spotted deer and on taking its flesh, he hurriedhimself towards Janasthaana. [3-44-27]"
3-45-1,"This is a much debated chapter in Ramayana because human complexities are involved in its narration. The sublimity of Seetha&#39;s characterisation is disputed by her speeches in here. The question is whether Seetha becomes an ideal woman in view of her tongue-lashing, or not. This is as good as asking the nature as to &#39;why it thunders before a storm, scaring children, birds and calves... cannot it just shower some rains and go...&#39; If anything is not done in accordance with her wish and whim, or which goes against her peculiar way of thinking, it is usual for a shrewd woman to tongue-lash. Here, Seetha is called a woman who is <em>bhartR^i prema antha - bhartR^i kShema arthi</em> &#39;blinded by the devotement to her husband...&#39; &#39;a desirer of her husband&#39;s welfare...&#39; even at her own risk."
3-45-2,"This Ramayana is not the story of Rama. It is <em>raama ayana</em> and becomes <em>raamaayaNa</em> when compounded. Again <em>raama</em> is not the epical hero Rama alone. Seetha is also <em>raamaa</em> as said by Sumantra in Ayodhya, Ch. 60, 10th verse:"
3-45-3,"Thus this epic is called <em>raamaa raamayoH ayanam raamaayaNam</em> &#39;the peregrination of Seetha and Rama...&#39; where the first word <em>raamaa</em> with elongated end syllable belongs to Seetha and the second <em>raama</em> with shortened end syllable belongs to Rama, and thus this is the peregrination of both Raamaa and Raama. If the course of the legend has to move forward, the characters have to move, and if they were to move, some situations should become turning points, and this is one such situation occasioned through the shrewdness of Seetha. In a legendary perspective, if evil is to be eliminated, good has to peregrinate troublesomely, and that troublesome peregrination of Seetha, as well as that of Rama, is triggered off at this situation, again due to the shrewdness of Seetha. Thus, there is no oddity in the shrewd talk of Seetha. Some more discussion is incorporated in the endnote."
3-45-4,"On identifying the grievous voice that is identifiable with her husband&#39;s voice, Seetha spoke to Lakshmana, you go at once, and check up on Raghava.&#39; [3-45-1]"
3-45-5,"I have heard the loud yelling voice of highly fretful Rama whereby my heart, or my very entity, is not abiding in its place, and it will be apt of you to protect such a brother of yours who is screaming in the forest. [3-45-2, 3a]"
3-45-6,"He might have come under the subjugation of demons as with a bull coming under the seize of lions, hence, you hurry up so as to near such a brother of yours who is seeking protection. So said Seetha toi Lakshmana. [3-45-3b, 4a]"
3-45-7,"Although she spoke a lot to him in this way, Lakshmana on his part has not moved out remembering his brother&#39;s order to stay guard to Seetha, and hence that Janaki, the daughter of Janaka, who is already agitated for Rama further spoke to him in the paradox of his not going out of hermitage. [3-45-4b, 5a]"
3-45-8,"You are like a foe of your brother in friend&#39;s mien, Soumitri, as you are not making a move towards a brother even if he is in an emergency. [3-45-5b, 6a]"
3-45-9,"Because of me you wish Rama to be completely destroyed, and only because of your cupidity for me you are not following up on Raghava. It is definite. [3-45-6b, 7a]"
3-45-10," &#39;Raghava in direst strait&#39; is the most liked thing to you, thus I deem, as you have no heart for that brother, and as you complacently stay behind even when that great-resplendent Rama is unseen. [3-45-7b, 8a]"
3-45-11,"After which helmsman you have come here that Rama is undergoing an uncertainty of life-and-death, as such I indeed wonder what business you have here now in staying with me at this hermitage? Seetha spoke so to Lakshmana. [3-45-8, 9a]"
3-45-12,"Lakshmana spoke to Seetha, the princess from Videha kingdom, who is talking deluged under tears and anguish in that way, as she is fretful like a she-deer. [3-45-9a, 10b]"
3-45-13,"Oh, Vaidehi, your husband is an impossible one for vincibility by serpents, asura-s, gandharva-s, gods, fiends, demons, no doubt about it."
3-45-14,"Oh, auspicious one, unmarked is some combatant who can counterattack Rama from among gods, humans, gandharva-s, birds, ogres, kinnaraa-s, beasts, or oh, lady, even from horrendous demons, as Rama vies with Indra in any given war. [3-45-11b, 12, 13a]"
3-45-15,"It is inapt of you to talk that way as Rama is inextirpable in a given war, and as for me, I do not venture to abandon you in this forest in the absence of Raghava. [3-45-13b, 14a]"
3-45-16,"Let the most forceful Crowns with all their military forces, or, all of the gods together with their heads, why they, let all the three worlds put together come mutinously, whether jointly or severally, Rama&#39;s prowess is irrestrainable. [3-45, 14b, 15a]"
3-45-17,"Hence, let your heart be diverted and anxiety divested, as your husband will be returning soon on killing that extraordinary deer. [3-45-15b, 16a]"
3-45-18,"Evidently it is not the voice of Rama, nor that of any other god, but someone mimicked that voice for chicanery, and that must be the illusory voice of that demon Maareecha, similar in effect to the magical city of gandharva-s usually created by magicians in general. [3-45-15b, 16]"
3-45-19,"And you are an entrustment, oh, best lady Vaidehi, as the great-souled Rama has entrusted you in my security, as such I do not dare to leave you off now. [3-45-17, 18a]"
3-45-20,"Oh, gracious lady, we have become the adversaries of these night-walkers insofar as the elimination of Khara and others, and concerning the eradication of Janasthaana. [3-45-18b, 19a]"
3-45-21,"The demons are the swaggerers in violence in great forests and they will be employing various voices. Therefore Vaidehi, just do not bother about it. Thus Lakshmana advised Seetha. [3-45-18b, 19, 20a]"
3-45-22,"As for Seetha, she became furious on hearing Lakshmana&#39;s words of advice, and while her eyes are becoming bloodshot she spoke these rude sentences to that veracious Lakshmana. [3-45-20b, 21a]"
3-45-23,"You are a debased one devoid of mercy, thus a dreadful one, and a degrader of your dynasty, and I deem that you derive pleasure from fatal hardship to Rama. [3-45-21b, 22a]"
3-45-24,"You are haranguing all these sermons only on noticing hardship to Rama. It is unsurprising that the pitiless ones and rivals of your kind, who always behave in a cloak-and dagger way, will tend to commit deadly sins, Lakshmana, and it is not uncommon. [3-45-22b, 23]"
3-45-25,"You are verily maleficent for you have singly and covertly followed Rama, who started to forests all alone, or instigated by Bharata, only because of me. [3-45-24]"
3-45-26,"Whether this is an intrigue of yours or that of Bharata it is unachievable, Saumitri. How can I long for another commoner when I have put my faith only in the lotus-blue-complexioned and lotus-bright-eyed husband of mine, Rama? [3-45-25, 26a]"
3-45-27,"If that comes to that, I will just discard my life in your presence, Soumitri do not mistake it. I do not eke out an existence on this earth even for a moment without Rama. Thus Seetha threatened Lakshmana. [3-45-26b, 27a]"
3-45-28,"When that self-mortified Lakshmana is addressed in this way with hair-raising and acerbic words by Seetha, he spoke to her suppliantly adjoining his palm-fold. [3-45-27b, 28a]"
3-45-29,"I do not venture to reply you Maithili, as you are like a deity to me. Women using words that are in a class by themselves is not at all surprising. This sort of bringing stilted words into play is the nature of women and it is obvious in the world. [3-45-28b, 29]"
3-45-30,"Women by their nature are unbound by the etiquette of decency, whimsical, cantankerous and they tend to become the artificers of vicissitudes, and oh, Vaidehi, the daughter of Janaka, indeed unbearable are this kind of words that are much the same as burnt iron arrows thrust in between my two ears. [3-45-30, 31a]"
3-45-31,"Let all of the forest-itinerants indeed listen as to how you are addressing me with bitter words, though I am reasoning with you conscientiously, and let them become my corroborators for the sake of justice. [3-45-31b, 32a]"
3-45-32,"Fie upon you, you are acrimoniously tempered owing to your faminality, and by which impulsive reason you mistrust me who am presently abiding in my brother&#39;s order, may God damn you for that crotchety. [3-45-32b, 33a]"
3-45-33,"I am going there where Rama is, oh, lady with best visage, you be blest, and oh, broad-eyed one, let all of the forest deities protect you. [3-45-33b, 34a]"
3-45-34,"Gauging by those dangerous forebodings that are now bidding fair, can I to see you again along with Rama on my return, or not? That I do not know. Thus Lakshmana spoke to Seetha. [3-45-34b, c]"
3-45-35,"When Lakshmana spoke to that wailful daughter of Janaka, she on her part spoke this curt sentence to him, while tears whelmed her to a fault. [3-45-35]"
3-45-36,"Without Rama I plunge myself in River Godavari, or else I string up myself, or discard this body of mine from heights... Thus Seetha started to vent out her feelings. [3-45-36]"
3-45-37,"I drink deadly poison, or I enter a flaring fire, but I will never touch another man other than Raghava. [3-45-37]"
3-45-38,"Seetha on declaring to Lakshmana in this way, she who is anguished and weeping bitterly, then started to smite her belly with both of her palms in a heightened agony. [3-45-38]"
3-45-39,"Observing the agonised aspect of Seetha that cheerless Saumitri started to cheer her up by repeatedly informing that her husband Rama will come soon. Even then Seetha has not spoken in the least to the brother of her husband, and maintained a silence of antipathy. [3-45-39]"
3-45-40,"But then, holding Seetha in usual reverence that self-respectful Lakshmana briefly came to her fore making a reverential palm-fold that briefly, and then he proceeded to the proximity of Rama, while repeatedly looking back at that lonely lady in the thick of forest. [3-45-40]"
3-46-1,"Raghava&#39;s younger brother Lakshmana is very much infuriated at Seetha who spoke to him rudely, as such he journeyed towards Rama at once as though he is yearning to see Rama immediately, albeit his heart wanted him to stand guard to Seetha. [3-46-1]"
3-46-2,"Quickly taking hold of intervallic time then the ten-headed Ravana approached Vaidehi adopting an aspect of a sanyaasi, a meandering Brahman friar. [3-46-2]"
3-46-3,"That sanyaasi is now cloaked in smooth silky saffron, his head-hair is neatly tufted, sandals are wooden, umbrella is on right shoulder, and on his left shoulder a shaft of sanyaasi is shouldered, onto which his handy water vessel is hooked, and he proceeded towards Vaidehi in a mien of meandering sanyaasi. [3-46-3, 4a]"
3-46-4,"As with a pitchiest gloom overcoming the sunless and moonless lively eventide, that great-mighty Ravana came over to Vaidehi in that forest, when she is without two of the brothers, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [3-46-4b, 5a]"
3-46-5,"As a sinister planet looks over Star Rohini when she is devoid of Moon, that extremely sinister Ravana then looked over the glorious and youthful princess Seetha. [3-46-5b, 6a]"
3-46-6,"On observing ferocious Ravana whose activities are iniquitous, the trees of Janasthaana are not in full sway, nor the wind is in full swing. [3-46-6b, 7a]"
3-46-7,"On seeing him who is seeing with his bloodshot eyes, River Godavari too is frightened and started to rush off quietly, whose onrush will be rapid otherwise. [3-46-7b, 8a]"
3-46-8,"In the meanwhile the Decahedron demon Ravana, who is all the while waiting for some lapse of Rama, neared Vaidehi in the getup of a sanyaasi. [3-46-8b, 9a]"
3-46-9,"That disgraceful Ravana made advances in a graceful mien of Brahman almsman to Vaidehi who is thinking over her husband, like the slow moving Saturn making advance to Star Citra which will be ominous. [3-46-9b, 10a]"
3-46-10,"Like a wellspring shrouded by grass, enshrouded in a decent getup of a Brahman friar, in a trice Ravana leeringly stood before of Vaidehi, the admirable wife of Rama. [3-46-10b, 11a]"
3-46-11,"While standing before her then Ravana eyed at the auspicious wife of Rama, whose lips and teeth are fine, visage is shiny like a full moon, and who is presently tortured by her tearful lamentation and sitting in the straw-cottage, and he approached that lotus-petal eyed Vaidehi who is dressed in ochry silks, as that night-walker is gladdened at his heart for her solitude. [3-46-11b, 12,13]"
3-46-12,"He who is hit by the arrows of Love-god that king of demons Ravana, on seeing Seetha entered resonating the resonances of Vedic-hymns as precursory in seeking alms, and spoke these well-mannered sentences to her who is in solitariness. [3-46-14]"
3-46-13,"Ravana really acclaimed her who is an excellent one in all the three worlds, beaming forth with the beauty of her body, and who is like Goddess Lakshmi but for Divine-lotus as Her settle, for Seetha is devoid of her settling, namely Rama. [3-46-15]"
3-46-14,"Glittering like the glitter of gold, silkened in ochry silks, you are like a lotus-tendril garlanded with divine lotuses as your ensemble, who are you? Thus Ravanan started addressing Seetha [3-46-16]"
3-46-15,"Oh, rosy faced one, are you the personified numen of Respect, Renown or Resplendence, or the Felicitous Lakshmi herself, or oh, curvaceous one, are you a nymphal Apsara, or the numen of Benefactress, or a self-motivated woman, or Rati Devi, the consort of Manmatha, the Love God. [3-46-17]"
3-46-16,"Your teeth are evenly, smooth and their tips are like jasmine buds, and your whitish broad eyes are spotless, reddish at ends, and pupils are black. [3-46-18]"
3-46-17,"Your hips are beamy, thighs burly akin to elephant&#39;s trunks, and these two breasts of yours that are ornamented with best jewellery are rotund, rubbing and bumping each other, and they are swinging up and up, their nipples are brawny and jutting out, and they are smoothish like palm-fruits, thus they are covetable for they are beautiful. [3-46-19, 20]"
3-46-18,"Oh, allurer, your smile is alluring, teeth are alluring, and your eyes allure, oh, beauty, your waist is palmful, your hair velvety, your breasts are jostling, and you rob my soul as a spate robs riverbank. [3-46-21, 22a]"
3-46-19,"I have not hitherto seen any earthly female with this kind of features on the face of earth; or, a goddess - no; a gandharva female - no; yaksha female - no; kinnaraa female - no, none whosoever! [3-46-22b, 23a]"
3-46-20,"I marvel why an excellent one in all the three worlds by her features, more so, fragile and youthful as yourself should be living here in the thick of forest. [3-46-23b, 24, 25a]"
3-46-21,"Such as you are you go back, let safety betide you, as you are unsuited to live in here, for this forest is the dwelling for ghastly demons who by their wish will be changing their guise. [3-46-24b, 25a]"
3-46-22,"Delightful rooftops of skyscrapers, flourishing and richly fragranced pleasure-gardens of cities alone are meetly to you to saunter. [3-46-25b, 26a]"
3-46-23,"Oh, beauteous lady, I opine that only best garlands, best scents, best foodstuffs, best clothing are meetly to you, oh, lady with black pupils, hence it is meet and right to you to have a best husband."
3-46-24,"Getting at you, the garlands, scents, foodstuffs, or clothing, they all become the best, because you are the best beauteous one, as such, he alone becomes a best person who gets you as his wife, and it is meet and right to you to choose such a husband, [aside: me alone.] [3-46-26b, 27a]"
3-46-25,"Oh, curvaceous lady, who are you? Oh, one with an impeccable smile, do you belong to Rudraa-gods, or Marut-gods, or to Vasu-s? To me you are beaming forth like a goddess. [3-46-27b, 28a]"
3-46-26,"This is the dwelling-place of demons, and no goddess, nor a gandharva, nor a kinnara can arrive here, but how you have come here? [3-46-28b, 29a]"
3-46-27,"Here, simians, lions, leopards, tigers, likewise other predators, bears, tigers, vultures will be moving. How you are not frightened from them? [3-46-29b, 30a]"
3-46-28,"Being alone in this forest, oh, lady with a lovely face, how you are unafraid of horrendous and mighty elephants possessed of rut? [3-46-30b, 31a]"
3-46-29,"Oh, auspicious lady, who are you? Whose are you? Also from where are you? And being lonely, what for you are moving in dreadful Dandaka forest that is adored by demons? Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-46-31, 32b]"
3-46-30,"When the wicked minded Ravana praised her in this way, Vaidehi the princess from Mithila has seen him who has arrived in the getup of Brahman and started to revere him with all the respects affordable to a casual guest. [3-46-32b, 33]"
3-46-31,"She firstly fetched a seat him, then invited him with water for feet-wash, and then said to him who looked gracious in his bearing, &#39;alms are ready.&#39; [3-46-34]"
3-46-32,"Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, and finding no reason to refute him flatly, as he has come like a Brahman, she invited him as a Brahman."
3-46-33,"Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, and as he came with an unimperilling appearance of a Brahman, she invited him as she would ordinarily invite a real Brahman. [3-46-35]"
3-46-34,"Oh, Brahman, this is the Darbha-grass-seat and you be seated comfortably, here is water, receive it for hand and feet wash, here is the forest grown victuals for your sake... dine on them relaxedly... Thus Seetha said to Ravana. [3-46-36]"
3-46-35,"Ravana thoroughly observed that wife of the king, Maithili, when she invited him talking civilities contextual in inviting a guest, that too Brahman sanyasi, and he firmed up his mind to abduct her even forcibly, and started to dedicate himself for destruction. [3-46-37]"
3-46-36,"Then she looked forward for her shapely husband who has gone on a hunting game, and who must be returning along with Lakshmana, and though she looked intently she could only see the green backdrop of that great forest, but not Rama or Lakshmana. [3-46-38]"
3-47-1,"When Ravana whose intention is to abduct her has enquired thus, then on the basis of his Brahman friar&#39;s mien Seetha informed about herself on her own. [3-47-1]"
3-47-2,"Thinking briefly that, &#39;he is a Brahman and an untimely guest, he will indeed curse me if he is not replied,&#39; Seetha spoke this sentence. [3-47-2]"
3-47-3,"I am the daughter of noble-souled Janaka, the king of Mithila, by name I am Seetha, and the dear wife and queen of Rama, let safety betide you. [3-47-3]"
3-47-4,"On residing in the residence of Ikshvaku-s in Ayodhya for twelve years, I was in sumptuosity of all cherishes while relishing all humanly prosperities. [3-47-4]"
3-47-5,"In the thirteenth year the lordly king Dasharatha deliberated together with his imperial ministers to anoint Rama as Crown Prince of Ayodhya. [3-47-5]"
3-47-6,"When Raghava&#39;s anointment was being organised my venerable mother-in-law known as Kaikeyi begged her husband Dasharatha for a boon. [3-47-6]"
3-47-7,"Restraining my veracious father-in-law by a good deed once done by her in his respect, Kaikeyi besought two boons from him, namely expatriation of my husband, and anointment of her son Bharata. [3-47-7, 8a]"
3-47-8," &#39;If Rama is anointed now, come what may I will not eat, sleep, or drink, and my life ends this way,&#39; thus Kaikeyi was adamantine, and the king and my father-in-law entreated her who is nagging with meaningful riches, but she did not make good on that entreaty. [3-47-8b, 9, 10a]"
3-47-9,"My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years are reckoned up from my birth. [3-47-10b, 11a]"
3-47-10,"Rama - thus he is exalted in the world, an unambiguous, unblemished, unsullied one, and a broad-eyed ambidextrous one, who delights in bringing universal welfare, is my husband. [3-47-11b, 12a]"
3-47-11,"But Rama&#39;s father Dasharatha was lovesick for Kaikeyi and to fulfil her desired aspiration that great king did not anoint Rama. [3-47-12b, 13a]"
3-47-12,"When Rama arrived in the presence of his father, Kaikeyi readily and decidedly spoke these words to my husband. [3-47-b, 14a]"
3-47-13," &#39;What your father has proclaimed, oh, Raghava, that may be heard from me. He said, &#39;let this thornless kingdom be accorded to Bharata.&#39; [3-47-14b, 15a]"
3-47-14,"And you, oh, Kakutstha Rama, indeed have to inhabit the forests for nine plus five years, hence you repair to forests and redeem your father from the remorse of perjury.&#39; [3-47-15b, 16a]"
3-47-15," &#39;As an unfearing one from any quarter and as a resolute one in his pledge my husband Rama said &#39;so be it&#39; to Kaikeyi and followed her dictate. [3-47-16b, 17a]"
3-47-16,"My husband is evermore a renderer but not a recipient, and forever he speaks truth, and not the untruth, least of all. Oh, Brahman, this is the unalterable and unsurpassable vow of Rama. [3-47-17b, 18a]"
3-47-17,"One known as Lakshmana is such a Rama&#39;s brother from another mother, and he is a valorous one, tigerly-man, and an eliminator of enemies in war. [3-47-18b, 19a]"
3-47-18,"He who is known as Lakshmana, a follower of virtue and steadfast in his commitment, followed Rama handling his bow as a helpmate, when Rama was proceeding to forests along with me. [3-47-19b, 20a]"
3-47-19,"Because Rama always abides in probity and resolutely vowed to it, he entered Dandaka forest in the aspect of a tufty haired saint along with me and his brother. [3-47-20b, 21a]"
3-47-20,"Such as we are, oh, eminent Brahman, we three are moving about the impenetrable Dandaka forest just by our own mettle as we fell down from kingdom owing to Kaikeyi. [3-47-21b, 22a]"
3-47-21,"Be comfortable for a moment, here it is possible for you to make a sojourn, and soon my husband will be coming on taking plentiful forest produce, and on killing stags, mongooses, wild boars he fetches meat, aplenty. [3-47-22b, 23]"
3-47-22,"Such as you are, oh, Brahman, you may make mention of your name, parentage and caste, in their actuality. For what reason you are wandering in Dandaka forest lonesomely? Thus Seetha questioned Ravana. [3-47-24]"
3-47-23,"Ravana, the great-mighty king of demons, brusquely replied Seetha, the wife of Rama, while she is still speaking in this way. [3-47-25]"
3-47-24,"Oh, Seetha, of whom all the worlds composed of gods, demons and humans are highly startled, I am that sovereign of hosts of demons, known as Ravana. [3-47-26]"
3-47-25,"On seeing you, oh, impeccable one, glittering with golden complexion and attired in ochry-silks, I derive no pleasure in my wives. [3-47-27]"
3-47-26,"You become my prime queen above all the choicest women with superior status, whom I have appropriated from here and there. [3-47-28]"
3-47-27,"Nestled on a mountaintop my great city known as Lanka is there in the midst of an ocean and all over encompassed by an ocean. [3-47-29]"
3-47-28,"Oh, Seetha, there you can saunter in pleasure-gardens along with me, and oh, lady with resentment, you will not think back to this forest-living, at all events. [3-47-30]"
3-47-29,"Oh, Seetha, if you become my wife five thousand handmaidens adorned with ornaments of every description will be in your attendance. Thus Ravana said to Seetha. [3-47-31]"
3-47-30,"When Ravana said in this way, Seetha the daughter of Janaka, a flawless one by her physique, dishonoured and replied that demon. [3-47-32]"
3-47-31,"I have avowed to adhere to such a husband Rama, who is inflexible like a sturdy mountain, comparable to lordly Indra, unshakable like a vast ocean. [3-47-33]"
3-47-32,"He who is enriched with all endowments, and who is like a banyan tree with its surmounted orbicularity, the high-minded one with truthfulness alone is his target, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. [3-47-34]"
3-47-33,"He who is ambidextrous, broad-chested, supreme among men, and a lion-like person with the strides of prancing lion, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. [3-47-35]"
3-47-34,"He who is a valiant one with a face like that of full-moon, a prince with his self-conquered, and he who is expressly acclaimed and effectively armed, and I am avowed to adhere to such a Rama. [3-47-36]"
3-47-35,"You being a fox you woo me who am an absolutely inaccessible lioness? Why wooing, it is impossible for you to touch me as with the untouchable Shine of the Sun. [3-47-37]"
3-47-36,"You who are an ill-fated demon, oh, demon, by your wooing the dear wife of Raghava, thus you must be visualising many golden trees, undeniably. [3-47-38]"
3-47-37,"Do you wish to twitch fangs from the mouth of a ravenous lion, the expeditious challenger of animals, and from the mouth of a rebounding venomous serpent. [3-47-39]"
3-47-38,"Do you wish to steal away the massive Mandara Mountain by the sleight of your hand, but how do you wish to decamp healthily without consuming lethal poison? [3-47-40]"
3-47-39,"If you wish to override the dear wife of Raghava, then it is as good as wishing to deeply scrape your eyes with needlepoint, and licking the razorblade with your tongue. [3-47-41]"
3-47-40,"You who wish to bitterly intimidate the dear wife of Rama are as good as the one who wish to swim an ocean arraying a boulder around his neck, and with a pair of hands you wish to steal away both the Sun and Moon? [3-47-42, 43a]"
3-47-41,"You who wish to abduct me with an auspicious legend as the wife of Rama, thus you wish to steal away a glowing fire in a cloth-bundle, though evincing it to be highly flaming? [3-47-43b, 44a]"
3-47-42,"You who wish to override the befitting and selfsame wife of Rama, are wishing to tread on the needle-sharp spikes of iron spears. [3-47-44b, c]"
3-47-43,"Which odds are there between a lion and a fox in a given forest, which odds are there between a turbid-rivulet and an ocean, and which odds are there between a fine-wine and sour-gruel, likewise you are also at odds with the son of Dasharatha. [3-47-45]"
3-47-44,"Which imparity is there among the metals of gold and lead, which imparity is there among the waters of sandalwood and sewage, which imparity is there between an elephant and a wildcat of forests, such an imparity exists between you and the son of Dasharatha. [3-47-46]"
3-47-45,"Which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a crow and an eagle, which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a waterfowl and a peacock, which dissimilarity obtains betwixt a swan and a falcon living in forest, such a dissimilarity obtains betwixt you and the son of Dasharatha. [3-47-47]"
3-47-46,"Even if you steal me away now, later when Indra similar Rama posits himself with his bow and arrows in hand on the battlefield, you cannot live on, and in the meanwhile you cannot digest me, as with a diamond swallowed along with a fly. Thus Seetha gave her vent to her disdainful feelings towards Ravana. [3-47-48]"
3-47-47,"On speaking these sentences with high-strung words, with all her unsullied intentions to that highly sullied night-rambler Ravana, her fragile body trembled tormentedly as with a banana plant up-heaved by gust. [3-47-49]"
3-47-48,"On closely marking Seetha to be tremulous, he that Ravana whose impetus is Death similar, clearly informed her of his name, caste, competency, and capability as his purpose is to cause scare. [3-47-50]"
3-48-1,"When Seetha spoke thus Ravana is embittered, and knitting his eyebrows he indeed spoke these rudish words to Seetha. [3-48-1]"
3-48-2,"I am known as Ravana, oh, lady with superb complexion, let safety betide you, the highly valorous and ten-headed stepbrother of Kubera. [3-48-2]"
3-48-3,"I am that Ravana at whose sight all the gods together with gandharva-s, evil-spirits, birds and snakes will always be frightened and fleeing, as with the people frightened and fleeing from death. [3-48-3]"
3-48-4,"I am that Ravana who when infuriated for some other reason took up a duel with Kubera, his brother from stepparent, wherein that Kubera is set up against and completely trounced in a combat. [3-48-4]"
3-48-5,"I am that Ravana by whom Kubera, the god for Wealth-Management whose vehicular transport is handled by humans, is tormented fearfully and made to completely abandon his wealthiest place which is presided over by him till then, and I am the one who made that Kubera to flee to the excellent Mt. Kailash where he is somehow living, because I will not cause any harm on Mt. Kailash as I hold it sacred. [3-48-5]"
3-48-6,"I am that Ravana, oh, auspicious lady, who just by his valour acquired Kubera&#39;s auspicious aircraft known as Pushpaka, whose pilotage is just by the wish of its aviator, with which I will be travelling in skies. [3-48-6]"
3-48-7,"Just by seeing rancour-shot face of mine, oh, Maithili, all the gods will quickly shoot off, even if Indra is leading them, then where is the question of their confronting me. [3-48-7]"
3-48-8,"Where I will be staying there the Air-god wafts doubtfully, lest his gusts and blasts may hurt me, and the Sun also effectuates his singeing sunbeams as cooling moonbeams, lest I may abduct his wife Prabha, the Sunshine. [3-48-8]"
3-48-9,"At places where I will be staying or freely moving there the leaves of trees will be less of rustle, lest I may wilt them up, and there the gush of water of rivers too will quieten, lest I may dry them up. [3-48-9]"
3-48-10,"My magnificent city known as Lanka is there on the other shore of the ocean, plethoric with all kinds of amenities, as well as with ghastly demons, which city will be on par with Indra&#39;s Amaravati, but for meekly gods and meaningless souls. [3-48-10]"
3-48-11,"That gorgeous city is completely walled in with compound walls that are adorned with whitish silver, and its palace-chambers are golden, and its archways are fully jewelled with lapis jewels. [3-48-11]"
3-48-12,"It is encumbered with elephants, horses and chariots, well sounded by the sounds of trumpets, and with trees which yield fruits that fulfil all the savours, and it is bedecked with chirrupy pleasure-gardens. [3-48-12]"
3-48-13,"Oh, princess, oh, self-respectful lady, if you reside there together with me, hè, Seetha, then you will not think of yourself as one from among human females. [3-48-13]"
3-48-14,"Revelling in humanly luxuries, over and beyond in heavenly luxuries also, you will not recollect humanly Rama, whose longevity is lessened. [3-48-14]"
3-48-15,"Though Rama is the eldest son, king Dasharatha established his dear son Bharata as king, and because Rama is spineless he is put to flight to forests, and now, what is he and what am I, in matter of sovereignty. [3-48-15]"
3-48-16,"Rama is subverted from kingdom, thus dwindled is valour, thus winded down is his anima, thus he has become a pitiable one, thus he became an ascetic as nothing else is there for him to undertake, oh, broad-eyed lady, what do you aspire to do with such a Rama? [3-48-16]"
3-48-17,"I, the king of all the demons, am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came to you in love, and instead of beseeching me to love you, your rejection and speaking this way, is unapt of you."
3-48-18,"Although I am the king of all the demons, on seeing you I am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came to you, thus you love me... but rejecting me this way is unapt of you, as you alone will be loosing heavenly comforts, if you reject me. [3-48-17]"
3-48-19,"Oh, modest lady, on refusing me you surely become remorseful like Uurvashi who once kicked Puruurava with her feet. [3-48-18]"
3-48-20,"He that Rama is merely a human, and in war he equals me not by my finger, oh, richly colourful lady, and I chanced here merely by your serendipity, thus you honour me and my desire to possess you... Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-48-19]"
3-48-21,"Vaidehi who is spoken thus is infuriated on her part and with her eyes bloodshot spoke these bitter words to the king of demons in that lonely lace. [3-48-20]"
3-48-22,"How you wish to commit sins although saying that Kubera, a god reverenced by all of the gods, is your brother? [3-48-21]"
3-48-23,"All the demons will perforce get completely destroyed, oh, Ravana, for whom you the cruel and culpable one with uncontrolled senses is the king, and you will be blameworthy for the elimination of righteous demons like Vibheeshana, et al. [3-48-22]"
3-48-24,"It may be possible to live after abducting Shaci Devi, the wife of Indra, somehow and anyhow there will be no liveability after abducting me, the wife of Rama. [3-48-23]"
3-48-25,"Oh, demon, un-mirrored is the prettiness of prettyish Shaci Devi, and one may live long on forcibly snatching her away from the hands of the wielder of Thunderbolt, Indra, but to him who intimidates or abuses me or women like me, there will be no <strong>moksha</strong>, release from the cycle of rebirth, even if he has consumed <strong>amR^ita</strong> ambrosia. Thus Seetha spoke to Ravana. [3-48-24]"
3-49-1,"On hearing Seetha&#39;s words that valorous ten-headed Ravana loudly clapped in dissent for once and divulged his very mighty body. [3-49-1]"
3-49-2,"That wordsmith Ravana again spoke these words to Maithili, Perhaps you have not heard about my valour and vanquishes in all your madness for Rama. [3-49-2]"
3-49-3,"Standing on the sky I can lift up the earth with two of my arms, I can completely gulp down any ocean, standing in war I can even put the Death to death. [3-49-3]"
3-49-4,"Indeed, I can split the Sun and splinter the earth with my splitting arrows, oh, mad woman, I can assume any form as I wish, and endow any wish you wish, such as I am, I must be your husband, behold me. So said Ravana when revealing his real nature. [3-49-4]"
3-49-5,"While the infuriated Ravana is saying in that way his eyes which by themselves are torchlit in their shine have became further bloodshot and blackened at their edges. [3-49-5]"
3-49-6,"Immediately discarding the gentle form of a Brahman friar, that younger brother of Kubera, Ravana, assumed his own ferocious form which is similar to the form of Terminator. [3-49-6]"
3-49-7,"That celebrated Ravana whose eyes are bloodshot as he is ensorcelled by desperate fury transmuted his form into a tend-faced, twenty-armed night-walker wearing golden ornaments of purified gold and appearing as a black tempestuous cloud. [3-49-7, 8a]"
3-49-8,"On discarding that guise of a Brahman friar that sovereign of demons Ravana educed his own physique and then that mighty bodied one attired in reddish clothing stood before Maithili observing that gem of a lady. [3-49-8b, 9]"
3-49-9,"She whose tresses are glossily blackish until their ends, and who has on her glittering jewellery and silken-ochry-sari, whereby who is imperceivable like sun&#39;s glaring shine, to such Maithili Ravana spoke. [3-49-10]"
3-49-10,"If you wish to have a husband of well-renown in three worlds you seek shelter in me, oh, high-hipped lady, I alone will match up to you as husband. [3-49-11]"
3-49-11,"Ultimately you have a much-lauded husband in me, as such you oblige me, and I will not cause any displeasure to you at any point of time. Let your heart refrain from that humanly Rama and you start bringing round your heart towards me. [3-49-12, 13a]"
3-49-12,"Oh, halfwitted lady, you who deem yourself a highly intellectual lady, listen, that mindless Rama who just by a word of a woman forebode kingdom along with all of his amiable people, and lives in this forest where the predators are on the prowl, thus he who is spurned off from kingdom, ungainful are his purposes, and who is even a short-lived human, I wonder by what merits you are impassioned for such a Rama? Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-49-13b, 14, 15a]"
3-49-13,"On saying that sentence to Maithili, who by herself is a nice talker and who is a proper one for addressing with nice words, that verily evil-minded demon Ravana maddened by lust drew nigh of Seetha and grabbed her, as Budha, the Jupiter grabs the Star Rohini in firmament. [3-49-15b, 16]"
3-49-14,"He that Ravana grabbed the lotus-eyed Seetha on lifting her up with his left hand at her plait of hair at nape, and with his right hand at her thighs. [3-49-17]"
3-49-15,"On seeing him who grabbed Seetha, who has incisive fangs, mightily armed and who is shining forth like a mountain crest and similar to Death, the forest deities quickly fled away terrorised by his terrorism. [3-49-18]"
3-49-16,"Then the miracle-air-chariot of Ravana which is miraculously designed to appear and disappear at the wish of its master, yoked with miraculous mules, and built with its golden wheels and parts, appeared afore Ravana braying noisily. [3-49-19]"
3-49-17,"Then he whose voice is strident that Ravana lifted her up by her waist and got Vaidehi up on the air-chariot intimidating her with bitter words. [3-49-20]"
3-49-18,"Agonised with anguish when gone into the captivity of Ravana, she that glorious Seetha wailed loudly for Rama saying &#39;oh, Rama,&#39; which Rama has gone deep into the forest by then. [3-49-21]"
3-49-19,"Ravana who is infatuated with lust picked her up, which lady is disinclined for any kind of sensuality and who is verily writhing like the wife of King Cobra, and then he surged skyward and flew off with her in his air-chariot. [3-49-22]"
3-49-20,"While that lord of demons is abducting her in the skyway, Seetha became frenzied with bewildered faculties and then bawled stridently like a hysterical person. [3-49-23]"
3-49-21,"Haa, greatly dextrous Lakshmana... oh, rejoicer of your mentor... you are incognisant of me who am being abducted by this demon who is a dissembler. [3-49-24]"
3-49-22,"Oh, Raghava, you have relinquished your high-life, happiness, and riches for the sake of righteousness, and though you avowed to protect your observants, you are unobservant of me who am being abducted by the unrighteousness itself. [3-49-5]"
3-49-23,"Oh, enemy-inflamer Rama, I reckon that you are an absolute controller of uncontrollable beings, I wonder why you are not controlling this kind of sinner, Ravana, indeed? This is how Seetha started her cry in wilderness. [3-49-26]"
3-49-24,"Indeed, the result for an evil act will not be apparent instantaneously. Even the time becomes a factor in the matter of cause and effect, as with the crops becoming cookable after certain time lag. Thus, she is addressing Ravana now. [3-49-27]"
3-49-25,"The Time has battered your brains and as an infringer you have undertaken this particular exploit, whereby you will get a devastating and life-ending tribulation from Rama. Thus, she upbraided Ravana. [3-49-28]"
3-49-26,"An honest wife of a glorious one who aspires nothing but honesty, such a wife of Rama as I am, I am being abducted, thus the aspiration of Kaikeyi and her kinfolk has now come true. Oh, god! Thus, she soliloquised. [3-49-29]"
3-49-27,"I call the attention of the flowered Karnikaara trees of Janasthaana, you inform Rama that Ravana is thieving Seetha. Thus, she is addressing the woods and others on the ground from air-chariot. [3-49-30]"
3-49-28,"I pray you who are with the bustle of swans and saarasa water birds, oh, River Godavari, you promptly tell Rama that Ravana is thieving Seetha. [3-49-31]"
3-49-29,"I also venerate you, the sylvan deities that travel in this forest with diverse trees or, those that abide on the treetops, you may please inform my husband that I am being stolen. [3-49-32]"
3-49-30,"Or, over there, some few beings that are living over there on the ground below, I seek shelter of all the flocks of birds and hoards of animals, and I pray you to convey this news. [3-49-33]"
3-49-31,"Inform my husband about his dear and loftier wife than his lives, saying that, &#39;helpless Seetha is stolen by Ravana.&#39; [3-49-34]"
3-49-32,"If that ambidextrous Rama comes to know about me, even if I am taken to heavens, or, even if I am impounded by Death, that great-mighty Rama brings me back, on aggressing against all of the gods in heaven, or, against Yama, the Death God. Thus, she appealed to one and all, but in vain. [3-49-35]"
3-49-33,"She that wide-eyed Seetha who is highly anguished and bewailing with pitiable words then with a wide-eyed expectancy saw the eagle Jatayu perching on a tree. [3-49-36]"
3-49-34,"She that well-waisted lady who has gone into the captivity of Ravana craned and stared at the eagle, and worsted by fear she shrieked squeakily with a stuttering voice that is walloped with anguish. [3-49-37]"
3-49-35,"Oh, fatherly Jatayu, see me, like an orphanized one I am pitiably abducted by this lord of demons with sinister deeds. [3-49-38]"
3-49-36,"It is impossible for you to forestall this merciless night-walker, for he is formidable, shining forth with cunning conquests, also thus this wicked minded one is with weaponry. [3-49-39]"
3-49-37,"Oh, Jatayu, everything about my abduction shall be narrated to Rama, or to Lakshmana, as it has happened in its entirety. Thus Seetha supplicated Jatayu. [3-49-40]"
3-50-1,"Jataayu who is slumbering away craned and stared on hearing the voicing of Seetha and then he saw Ravana and even Vaidehi. [3-50-1]"
3-50-2,"That best bird majestic Jataayu with a very sharp beak and appearing like a mountain peak, then uttered these words of expediency still perching on a tree. [3-50-2]"
3-50-3,"Oh, brother, now it is inapt of you to undertake a deplorable deed. I am one of those who abide by perpetual probity and avowed to truthfulness. Such as I am, oh, Decahedral-demon Ravana, I am the mightiest king of eagles known by the name Jataayu. [3-50-3, 4a]"
3-50-4,"Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is the master of all the world, one similar to Mahendra and Varuna, the Rain-god, and the one who is connected with the well-being of all the world. [3-50-4b, 5a]"
3-50-5,"Whom you desire to abduct now, that best lady is Seetha by her name, and this glorious one is the legitimate wife of that preserver of all the worlds, namely Rama. [3-50-5b, 6a]"
3-50-6,"How a king adhering to probity can lay his hands on the wives of others? If it is a king&#39;s wife, oh, great-mighty Ravana, she is to be safeguarded particularly. [3-50-6b, 7a]"
3-50-7,"Reverse your filthy course, or fortuity, or mind form laying your hands on other&#39;s wives. A sagacious person does not undertake that deed by which others deplore him. As with the protection of one&#39;s own wife from somebody&#39;s laying hands on her, other person&#39;s wife is also to be protected in that way. [3-50-8 [3-50-7b, 8]"
3-50-8,"If the means to gain probity, or prosperities, or even pleasures are inconspicuous in scriptures, oh, the scion of Paulastya, then even the erudite scholars will conduct themselves following the king and his demeanour. [3-50-9]"
3-50-9,"A king is the best repository for probity, prosperities, and pleasures, and whether it is probity or felicity or even iniquity that will emerge from the fount called king. [3-50-10]"
3-50-10,"Oh, prominent one among demons, deviltry and mercuriality are but natural for you demons, but how you have amassed affluence, as with an evildoer attaining an aircraft that puts him to flight to heaven."
3-50-11,"You by your nature are a devilish and mercurial personality though you have come from a decent lineage, how you have become an outranking demon among demons and how you could attain kingdom, which is to be ruled righteously, like an evildoer attaining a heaven-bound aircraft. [3-50-11]"
3-50-12,"He whose nature is such, that nature is perhaps impossible to efface, a sermon does not dwell in the heart of an evil-minded one for a long time, indeed."
3-50-13,"He whose nature itself is vile, it is perhaps impossible for him to efface it, and in the residence of such an evil-minded person, evilly acquired prosperity does not dwell for a long time, indeed. [3-50-12]"
3-50-14,"When that great-mighty Rama has not transgressed either in your country or in your city Lanka, then how you become a transgressor in respect of that noble-souled Rama? [3-50-13]"
3-50-15,"If Rama of indefatigable deeds firstly eliminated Khara who is stationed at Janasthaana, and who transgressed for the sake of Shuurpanakha, tell me what in actuality is the highly overstepping behaviour of Rama in that matter, whereupon you are stealing off with the wife of such a lord of world? [3-50-14, 15]"
3-50-16,"Instantly deliver up Vaidehi. Let not the disastrous and glowing fire-like eyes of Rama, which transmogrify so when he assumes fury, burn you down as the Thunderbolt of Indra once burnt the demon Vritta. [3-50-16]"
3-50-17,"You are unconscious that you have presently bundled a lethally venomous serpent at the fringe of your attire, and you are equally unwary that the Terminator&#39;s lasso is presently loosened around your neck. [3-50-17]"
3-50-18,"Oh, cultured one, that weight alone is to be shouldered by which a man is not brought down, and that repast alone is to be consumed by which nothing upsets. [3-50-18]"
3-50-19,"Who will undertake a deed that yields neither probity, nor deference, nor distinction but results in just physical drudgery? [3-50-19]"
3-50-20,"I have dedicated myself to the kingdom of my fathers and forefathers according to tradition, and sixty thousand years have elapsed since I was born. [3-50-20]"
3-50-21,"You are youngish whereas I am oldish, you are an armoured archer darting arrows from an air-chariot, whereas I am pensile bird in an open sky. Nevertheless, on taking Vaidehi you cannot abscond safely. [3-50-21]"
3-50-22,"It will be incapable of you to forcibly abduct Vaidehi when I keep an eye one her, as with the defilement of definitive Vedic scriptures by the logicians, dialecticians, materialists and suchlike non-believers, with their conjectural logic."
3-50-23,"Veda-s are definitive in their canons and their authority is established beyond doubt, yet the doubtful scholarly logicians still try to pamper their import with their conjectural logic, and when I am watchful of what is going on I do not let you pamper Seetha, as such take this caution and release her. [3-50-22]"
3-50-24,"Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier. [3-50-23]"
3-50-25,"He who eliminated demons and ogres in combats time after time, that Rama though apparently attired in jute-cloths like a meek-saint, will become a towering-inferno in a given combat, and he eliminates you very soon. [3-50-24]"
3-50-26,"What can possibly be done by me when those princes have gone far-off! It is beyond the scope of my fetching them in time! You knave, you who are scared of them will now be lost to my blockade, without a doubt. [3-50-25]"
3-50-27,"When I am alive you cannot lead away this auspicious, lotus-leave-eyed Seetha, the dear queen of Rama. [3-50-26]"
3-50-28,"But I must definitely accomplish something to forestall you till they come, for I cannot willingly depart from here to fetch any of the two brothers, and that deed I needs must do shall be agreeable to the great-souled Rama, likewise even to Dasharatha, even at the stake of my life. [3-50-27]"
3-50-29,"Stopoff! Stopoff! Oh, Decahedral Ravana, briefly learn of me as how I jettison you from your best air-chariot, as with the unloading of a burdensome fruit from its sepals. Oh, nightwalker, I will be giving guestship to you in a duel as long as I am alive. [3-50-28]"
3-51-1,"When Ravana is spoken to by Jataayu with judicious words, Ravana&#39;s eyes reddened infuriately, and his burnished golden ear-knobs flickered injuriously, and that lord of demons dashed towards the lord of birds, intolerantly. [3-51-1]"
3-51-2,"As with two gigantic clouds up-heaved by the tornadic gusts will be hard hitting each other tempestuously in sky, the combat between those two, Ravana and Jataayu, became tempestuous in the sky. [3-51-2]"
3-51-3,"As with a startling combat between two gigantic and winged mountains, called Mt. Maalyavanta-s, that combat between the eagle and demon then became a startling one. [3-51-3]"
3-51-4,"Then the great-mighty Ravana incessantly stormed the lord of eagles Jataayu, with arrows that have excruciating and highly dreadful arrowheads, like tubular arrows, iron arrows, and with arrows that have crescentic arrowheads. [3-51-4]"
3-51-5,"That eagle Jataayu who is the lord of winged-chariots, namely birds, in turn sustained those arrays of Ravana&#39;s arrows in that combat. [3-51-5]"
3-51-6,"But that great-mighty Jataayu severally made gashes on the body of Ravana with his two feet that have gashing claws for that bird is with best stamina. [3-51-6]"
3-51-7,"Now the Decahedral demon Ravana infuriately took up ten deadly arrows that are similar in their shine to the Shafts of the Terminator, wishful of the elimination of his enemy. [3-51-7]"
3-51-8,"That highly energetic Ravana released and impaled the eagle with straight shooting arrows on fully stretching the bowstring up to his ear, whose steel-pointed arrowheads are sharp, hurtful, and deadly. [3-51-8]"
3-51-9,"That Jataayu on seeing teary-eyed Jaanaki in the chariot of the demon forcefully lunged towards that demon heedless of arrows that are lunging at him. [3-51-9]"
3-51-10,"That unexcelled bird of high refulgence then shattered Ravana&#39;s bow which is decorated with pearls and gemstones, and on which an arrow is admitted targeting the eagle, just by the pair of his bare feet. [3-51-10]"
3-51-11,"Ravana convulsed in anger then took up another bow and stormed hundreds and thousands of arrow storms. [3-51-11]"
3-51-12,"Nested in the arrows shot by Ravana that lordly bird Jataayu then shone forth in that combat like a bird that obtains a readymade nest. [3-51-12]"
3-51-13,"On winnowing those arrays of arrows with both of his wings, he that highly refulgent Jataayu shattered the mighty bow of Ravana with both of his feet. [3-51-13]"
3-51-14,"That highly resplendent lord of birds also blasted off the armour of Ravana, which is glowing and flamelike in its flare, with both of his feet. [3-51-14]"
3-51-15,"Mighty Jataayu also knocked off the ghost-faced mules yoked to the chariot of Ravana which are covered in golden armours and tantivy in fastness. [3-51-15]"
3-51-16,"Then that great-chariot which is flourishing with three bamboos from chassis to yoke, and which traverses just by its steersman&#39;s wish, and which is crafted fantastically with gem-studded body and stairs, or, whose wheels are crafted with gold and gemstones, and which in its flare is like a Ritual-fire, Jataayu splintered down even that chariot of Ravana. [3-51-16]"
3-51-17,"Jataayu swiftly collapsed the parasol of Ravana which in shine is mirroring the full moon, along with the regalia of white-royal-fur-fans, together with the demons handling them for fanning Ravana. [3-51-17]"
3-51-18,"Again that highly energetic and imposing king of birds pecked off the robust head of the charioteer of Ravana with beak. [3-51-18]"
3-51-19,"Now Ravana who is with his devastated bow, devoid of chariot, dispatched are his horses and departed is his charioteer, and such as he is, he on grabbing Vaidehi by her torso, or, placing her on the lower end of his torso, jumped to earth. [3-51-19]"
3-51-20,"On seeing Ravana who is foundered onto earth from his crumbled vehicle, all beings like sylvan deities, caarana-s, siddha-s and suchlike, reverenced that lordly eagle Jataayu. [3-51-20]"
3-51-21,"But on seeing the commandant of birds Jataayu is fatigued owing to his senescence, Ravana is gladdened and he again rose up to skies taking Maithili. [3-51-21]"
3-51-22,"The highly resplendent king of eagles Jataayu swiftly rose to sky dashing practically to forestall Ravana, which demon&#39;s assault devices are all demolished by now save for a single sword, but who is cheerful to spirit away the daughter of Janaka, and actually spiriting away holding her onto his flank, and Jataayu spoke this to such Ravana. [3-51-22, 23]"
3-51-23,"You mean-minded Ravana, you abduct her whose husband wields arrows that touch off like the Thunderbolt of Indra, and this spite of yours is definitely for the destruction of all the demons. [3-51-24]"
3-51-24,"As one thirsteth drinketh water, you drinketh venomous drink along with your friends, relatives, ministers, armies, and with your accomplices, as this abduction of Seetha itself is squirrelling away dangerous poison. [3-51-25]"
3-51-25,"As with the mindless adventurers quickly getting ruination for they undertake self-ruinous exploits, unknowing the backlashes thereof, so also you too will ruin that quickly with this mindless adventure. [3-51-26]"
3-51-26,"You are tethered for termination with the lasso of the Terminator, as with a fish that can go nowhere on its biting fishhook with a piece of flesh. How do you untether yourself from that lasso of the Terminator, even if you go anywhere? [3-51-27]"
3-51-27,"But, oh Ravana, the unassailable Raghava-s of Kakutstha dynasty will nevermore condone your assailing this hermitage. [3-51-28]"
3-51-28,"Like a dastard you are committing a crime of thieving Seetha when none at home in the footsteps of thieves, this thieving is contemptible to society and condemnable by valiant ones. [3-51-29]"
3-51-29,"Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier. [3-50-23]"
3-51-30,"A person undertakes such an unrighteous and fateful activity if only death looms large on him. You too have undertaken this unrighteous fateful activity only for your self-ruination. [3-51-31]"
3-51-31,"If sin is consequential to any given activity who will undertake it? Even if that person vies with the Self-Born God and Lord of the Universe, namely Brahma, will he undertake it? Thus Jataayu advised Ravana. [3-51-32]"
3-51-32,"Even on speaking those commonsensical words to Ravana, Jataayu found him carrying off Seetha heedlessly, then that valorous Jataayu descended on the hind-side of that Decahedral demon Ravana, devastatingly. [3-51-33]"
3-51-33,"On clasping Ravana with incisive claws Jataayu lacerated deeply and rampantly, as a mahout, an elephant-trainer-controller, sitting astride on it will try to control an uncontrollable elephant that is running amok with an incisive goad. [3-51-34]"
3-51-34,"Weaponed only with his claws, wings, and beak, Jataayu not only tore the back of Ravana asunder applying his beak and claws, but started to tweeze even his hair. [3-51-35]"
3-51-35,"His lips becoming intolerantly quivery when Ravana is exasperated by that king of eagles repetitiously, that demon staggered on to his right targeting the hovering eagle at his hind-side to fell it down. [3-51-36]"
3-51-36,"Ravana who is aggrieved and convulsed in fury hit back Jataayu with his palm while firmly clutching Vaidehi onto his left flank. [3-51-37]"
3-51-37,"Jataayu, the lord of birds, being a vanquisher of enemies outstripped Ravana and ripped off ten left-arms of Ravana with his beak, with which left arms Ravana is clutching Vaidehi, in order to release her from his clutches. [3-51-38]"
3-51-38,"Though his arms are mutilated thus, they instantaneously ricocheted from his body like snakes possessing a series of venomous blazes sprawling out from a snake pit. [3-51-39]"
3-51-39,"The valorous Decahedron Ravana then threw off Seetha, and out of fury he scuffled with the king of eagles with fisticuffs and kicks, by both his feet and fists. [3-51-40]"
3-51-40,"Then there chanced an encounter for some time between those two valorous ones with mutually outweighing capabilities, namely the chieftain of demons and the chief of the birds. [3-51-41]"
3-51-41,"Ravana brandishing his sword at Jataayu, who is revolting for the sake of Rama, hewed off both of his wings, sides, and feet. [3-51-42]"
3-51-42,"When that demon of cruel actions has ruptured his wings that colossal eagle Jataayu immediately fell down to earth with a lessened life. [3-51-43]"
3-51-43,"On seeing Jataayu fallen on earth and dampened with blood Vaidehi fell into a fit of weeping and ran towards him as if he is her own relative. [3-51-44]"
3-51-44,"Ravana, the monarch of Lanka, gazed at that worthily valorous Jataayu, who in his shine is like a blue-black cloud with a whitely white chest and who by now is like a quiescent fire-storm flattened onto ground. [3-51-45]"
3-51-45,"But then Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, whose face vies with moonshine hugged eagle Jataayu, whom Ravana has subjugated with his forcefulness and felled down onto the surface of earth, and she wept over incessantly. [3-51-46]"
3-52-1,"Seetha whose visage is like a full moon wept on gazing the king of eagles Jataayu whom Ravana nearly killed. [3-52-1]"
3-52-2,"Humans definitely perceive either agony or ecstasy by its concomitant happenings, or by the characteristics of uncommon reflexes of their own body parts, or by the presages, or by conjecturable concomitants, or by cognising calls of birds. [3-52-2]"
3-52-3,"Oh, Rama, for sure you are not able to know about big catastrophe called my kidnap is chancing on you, even though oh, Kakutstha, these animals and birds are running towards you surely for my sake, to tell about me. [3-52-3]"
3-52-4,"Oh, Rama, this sky flier Jataayu who mercifully came here to save me is verily mangled on his encountering Ravana, and he is sprawling on earth, indeed by my ill luck. Thus Seetha wailed. [3-52-4]"
3-52-5,"That best lady who is very highly panicked bawled noisily, oh, Rama of Kakutstha... oh, Lakshmana... liberate me now... as though the addressees are before her. [3-52-5]"
3-52-6,"That sovereign of demons, Ravana, rushed towards Vaidehi whose garlands and jewellery are muddled up and who is bawling like an orphanized one. [3-52-6]"
3-52-7,"Ravana, the lord of demons, has repeatedly and harshly taunted Seetha saying, &#39;leave it off, leave it off...&#39; when Seetha devoid of Rama in that timberland is clinging and muffling a sturdy tree like a climber plant, and bawling, &#39;Rama, Rama,&#39; and that demon whose shine is similar to the Death has clutched her hair loosened from her bun, as death loomed large on him. [3-52-7, 8]"
3-52-8,"While Vaidehi is insulted thus, entire world together with its mobile or sessile beings became chaotic, and there chanced a blanketing of a blinding blackness, and waft-less is the Wind and shine-less is the Sun. [3-52-9]"
3-52-9,"On seeing Seetha&#39;s appropriation by an inappropriate being with His clairvoyant eyes, the illustrious Grandparent of Universe Brahma declared, the deed is done... but all of the supreme sages in Brahma&#39;s abode on seeing Seetha in such a condition became despondent, and yet delighted in foreseeing results. [3-52-10b, 11a]"
3-52-10,"On seeing Seetha&#39;s appropriation by an impropriate being, the dwellers in Dandaka forest cognised that Ravana&#39;s annihilation has chanced coincidentally. [3-52-12]"
3-52-11,"Ravana, the lord of demons, on wresting Seetha who is bawling, Rama... Rama... also thus as, Lakshmana... took flight skyward. [3-52-13]"
3-52-12,"That princess Seetha scintillated like the oblique flashes of lightning in a cloud, owing to her golden coloured body which is muffled up with jewellery of pure gold, and added with a golden coloured ocherish silky dress, while traversing in the sky. [3-52-14]"
3-52-13,"When her ochreish silk sari&#39;s upper fringe is upheaved by air onto to Ravana, Ravana looked blazing like a mountain set ablaze, muchly and overly. [3-52-15]"
3-52-14,"Reddish and scented lotus-petals adorning that highly auspicious Seetha have slithered, but again upheaved by air they are bestrewn on Ravana. [3-52-16]"
3-52-15,"Upper fringe of Seetha&#39;s silk sari with golden glitter is upheaved in the sky, and with the reddish hue of sun in red heat of midday it beamed forth like a reddish cloud. [3-52-17]"
3-52-16,"As with a stalk-less lotus the immaculate visage of Seetha is unbright in the sky when she is on the flank of Ravana as Rama is not in vicinage. [3-52-18]"
3-52-17,"Her lotus pistil like un-pimply face is adorned with a pretty forehead on which prettyish curls are fluttering, and with teeth that are spick and span and sparkling, but tears dabbed on that face to sideways when she wept, yet it is pleasant like moon for a sight with shapely nose, pretty eyes, roseate lips, and shining with golden hue in sky. Nevertheless, when she has gone in the flank of Ravana on the sky such an immaculate face of Seetha turned like a palish moon that has just risen bursting a bluish cloud. [3-52-19, 20, 21]"
3-52-18,"Highly disconcerted by the king of demons that auspicious face of Seetha is unbright like the moon arisen in daytime with somewhat golden hue, owing to the absence of Rama. [3-52-22]"
3-52-19,"She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone forth like a sapphirine gemstone studded in a golden cincture."
3-52-20,"She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone forth like a golden cincture girded to an elephant. [3-52-23]"
3-52-21,"Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, with a complexion that is goldenly yellowish in the tinge of a lotus, moreover with her ornaments of purified gold, flashed like a lightning possessed in a dark-cloud, when that stonehearted Ravana possessed her. [3-52-24]"
3-52-22,"With the rustles of Vaidehi&#39;s jewellery that lord of demons shone forth like a shipshape blue-black cloud with rumbles and undulating lightning. [3-52-25]"
3-52-23,"Flowers gracing her best body on her head, in garlands on chest, and on armlets have fallen all-over the surface of earth like showers of flowers while she is being abducted. [3-52-26]"
3-52-24,"Though that flower-shower has fallen all-over, it is windswept by the speed of Ravana, and fell again on that Decahedral demon. [3-52-27]"
3-52-25,"Like the garland of pristine stars that circles round the loftiest Mt. Meru, that flower-shower circled Ravana, the brother of Kubera. [3-52-28]"
3-52-26,"Slid from the left foot of Vaidehi her anklet adorned with gems fell down onto the plane of earth like an electric annulus with its sparky sparkles. [3-52-29]"
3-52-27,"She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, herself becoming a golden girdle girded around the elephant like Ravana."
3-52-28,"She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, as with an elephant, with a golden girdle, stabled in an elephant-stable by a mahout, the elephant-trainer. [3-52-30]"
3-52-29,"Ravana, the brother of Kubera, on invading the sky abducted that radiant Seetha who is radiating the sky by her own radiancy like a massive meteor. [3-52-31]"
3-52-30,"Some of her ornaments which are lustrously flamy, for they are sparkling like the sparkles of fireworks, are strewn about on the plane of earth with much clatter like the stars pelted down from the sky. [3-52-32]"
3-52-31,"A multi-string pearl pendant, a rivi�re, that vies with the moonshine has glissaded from the medial of her breasts, and while glissading from sky it is sheeny like River Ganga while she glissaded from skies. [3-52-33]"
3-52-32,"The trees on which diverse birds are perching have been stirred up with the wind blown and up-heaved by the gust of Ravana&#39;s flight, while the swaying motion of those treetops is as though waving hands to console Seetha saying, fear not... fear not... [3-52-34]"
3-52-33,"With wilted lotuses and scared fishes and other beings moving in water the lotus lakes are unenthusiastically sorrowing for Maithili as though Seetha is their girlfriend."
3-52-34,"The lakes with lotuses as their faces, and fishes as their eyes, and with the other facial adornments like the swimming, sweeping and sailing water-moving beings like tortoises, waterfowls and the like are unenthused, for a similar girlfriend of theirs, the lotus-faced, fish-eyed, lotus-modelled Seetha is beleaguered, and thus they are sorrowing for such a selfsame Maithili. [3-52-35]"
3-52-35,"All lions, tigers, animals and birds have then gathered in herds from all-over and ran rancorously and pursuantly shadowing the shadow of Seetha. [3-52-36]"
3-52-36,"The mountains appeared bewailing with their waterfalls as shedding tears and with their peaks as upraised arms, while Seetha is thus being abducted. [3-52-37]"
3-52-37,"On seeing Vaidehi who is being abducted thus, magnificent Sun in firmament is saddened, and lowly weakened is his sunshine, palely whitened is his sun-disc, and faintly deadened is his solar constant. [3-52-38]"
3-52-38,"When Ravana is abducting none other than the wife of Rama, then there is no probity. At such a juncture, how conscience can prevail? Unfounded are candour and compassion, thus the throngs of all beings overly regretted. [3-52-39, 40a]"
3-52-39,"Verily frightened are the fawns of deer, and their saddened faces are with tear shedding eyes with flustered looks, and they looked up and up at Seetha in sky and wept. [3-52-40b, 41a]"
3-52-40,"On seeing Seetha who is undergoing anguish in that way the sylvan deities physically shuddered in a worst way. [3-52-41b, 42a]"
3-52-41,"She who is looking searchingly at the plane of earth for Rama or Lakshmana, and truly bawling in high-pitched but mellowly voice calling Rama, Lakshmana, and whose hair-lengths are tousled, and whose felicitous vermilion mark on her forehead is smudged very untidily, that Decahedral demon abducted such an uncompromising husband-devout, Vaidehi, only for his self-ruination. [3-52-42a, 43]"
3-52-42,"She who is already detracted from her kinsfolk in Mithila or in Ayodhya, that Maithili with pretty teeth and clean-cut smile is then distanced from the only two last kinsmen, for either Raghava or Lakshmana or both are unseen by her, and thus her face is paled for she is chastened by the cumber of consternation. [3-52-44]"
3-53-1,"Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, on seeing the skyward flight of Ravana taking heralong became highly frantic and remaining in highest dismay she is distraught. [3-53-1]"
3-53-2,"Seetha whose eyes turned coppery-red with tears and resentment, still outpouringtears while being abducted she piteously poured this scorn on that gory-eyed demon's chief, Ravana.[3-53-2]"
3-53-3,"You knave Ravana, you are taking flight on thieving me after prowling about myloneliness, such as you are, are you not ashamed in the least for this subterfuge. [3-53-3]"
3-53-4,"You black-hearted fiend, for sure, you alone sidelined my husband in a trickishguise of Golden Deer wishful to abduct me as you are a coward. [3-53-4]"
3-53-5,"Which king of eagles battled against you to bail me out, an old friend of myfather-in-law, such as he is he is also felled, indeed. [3-53-5]"
3-53-6,"Ah, truly what an audacious audacity is shown by you... you basely demon... byear-shattering your great name saying that 'I am Ravana...' I am conquered in a combat -Really?"
3-53-7,"Am I conquered by you in a combat between my husband and you, wherein you onannouncing your name to my husband and truly showing your audacious audacity defeated my husband,and thus triumphing over me - or what? Tell me, you mousy demon..."
3-53-8,"Unable to conquer my husband in a combat, but able to earbash your name to a lonelywoman and abducting her, will this tantamount to your apparently audacious audacity? Thus, I am notreally triumphed over by a lowly demon like you... [3-53-6]"
3-53-9,"A woman, that too a lonely one, that too the other man's wife, that too anabduction, but not winning or wooing her... you knave, on your undertaking such a kind ofdeplorable deed, how unashamed are you? [3-53-7]"
3-53-10,"A self-glorifier as you are, this highly inhuman, iniquitous, imputable deed ofyours will be recounted by all men in all worlds. [3-53-8]"
3-53-11,"Damn with what you have said then about your might and mettle... damn with thiskind of your demeanour which is lamentable to whole of your clan in this world. [3-53-9]"
3-53-12,"What can be done possibly... why because you are fleeing very speedily in thisway... wait for a moment to ascertain whether you can go back in aliveness... [3-53-10]"
3-53-13,"On your coming into the line of sight of those two princes, even if you are withwhole of your military, you will be incapacitated to live on, indeed even for a moment...[3-53-11]"
3-53-14,"Anywise it will be incapable of you to endure the touch of their arrows, as with abird that cannot endure the overly flaring up wildfire in a forest. [3-53-12]"
3-53-15,"Oh, Ravana, positively contemplate in your soul and politely release me... and ifyou do not release me, indeed by the rancour of insulting me, my husband along with his brotherdevises your doom... [3-53-13, 14a]"
3-53-16,"You rogue! By which endeavour you are desirous of thieving me under duress, thatendeavour of yours behoves absurd. [3-53-14b, 15a]"
3-53-17,"Though I am in aliveness now, but on my going under the control of an enemy and onunseeing godlike husband of mine I am indeed unenthused to bear up my lives for a long.[3-53-15]"
3-53-18,"Definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either that which isworthwhile or that which is beneficial to you, as mortals undertake a quirkily behaviour at thetime of their death..."
3-53-19,"At the time of their death mortals wish to enjoy noxious and non-recuperativefoods, thus definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either nontoxic or beneficialnourishments for your well-being. [3-53-16b, 17a]"
3-53-20,"But which is recuperative that is unpalatable to all of the death-rattlers, andindeed, I behold you as one around whose throat the noose of Time is looped. [3-53-17b, 18a]"
3-53-21,"As you are dauntless in this daunting situation as for yourself, oh, Decahedraldemon, indeed it is clear that you are clearly fantasising the ill-omened golden trees all around.[3-53-18b, 19a]"
3-53-22,"Oh, Ravana, you will see the ghastly River Vaitarani which will be tumultuouslystreaming with blood streams, also thus you will see the grisly sword-leaved-forests in hell.[3-53-19b, 20a]"
3-53-23,"You will see silk-cotton trees flowered with molten gold, shrouded with lapisgemlike melting leaves, and enshrouded with sharp irony thorns in hell. [3-53-20b, 21a]"
3-53-24,"Oh, unmerciful one, on doing this kind of misdeed to that noble-souled Rama you areincapable to bear up life for a long time like the one who quaffed venom. [3-53-21b, 22a]"
3-53-25,"You are bound by the unpreventable lasso of the Time, oh, Ravana, on going whereyou will get complacency from that uncompromising husband of mine? [3-53-22b, 23a]"
3-53-26,"By whom fourteen thousand demons are killed in war just within a minute,single-handedly without any help from his brother, how then that brave and mighty Raghava, anexpert in all kinds of missiles, will not eliminate you, the stealer of his chosen wife, with hismordant arrows? Thus Seetha poured forth her ire at Ravana. [3-53-23b, 24, 25a]"
3-53-27,"On saying this much and other exacting words, Vaidehi who has gone onto the flank ofRavana, indeed lamented lamentably as her dismay is coalesced with her distress. [3-53-25b, c]"
3-53-28,"She who is highly agonised and weeping before talking, a ranter who ranted much, aresentful lady who has come of age, and a pitiable whirler in the hands of demon whose whirligighas transformed into spasmodic jerking of her body for deliverance from that sinner, and in thatway that sinner stole that princess Seetha. [3-53-26]"
3-54-1,"Vaidehi has not seen any rescuer while she is abducted, but she has seen fiveprominent vanara-s staying on a mountaintop. [3-54-1]"
3-54-2,"That broad-eyed and curvaceous lady with resentment Seetha, inwrapping herauspicious ornaments in the upper-fringe of her sari, dropped in the midmost of those five Vanara-swith a thinking that 'these creatures may perhaps indicate them to Rama.' [3-54-2, 3a]"
3-54-3,"On his part that Decahedron Ravana has not noticed her action in whipping up hersilky upper-cloth and ornaments, their bundling and stowing away at five vanara-s, owing to his ownhurry. [3-54-3]"
3-54-4,"Those ochreish-eyed best Vanara-s with their unwinking eyes have observed thebroad-eyed Seetha, who at that time is verily wailing. [3-54-4b, 5a]"
3-54-5,"The chief of demons Ravana captivating Maithili, who is still wailing, has crossedthe Pampa region down underneath and advanced facing the City of Lanka. [3-54-5b, 6a]"
3-54-6,"Ravana is jubilantly happy in stealing his own death alias Seetha, as one wouldcarry a stingingly fanged and lethally venomous she-snake in his own lap. [3-54-6b, 7a]"
3-54-7,"He bolted out in skyway up above the woodlands, waterways, pools, and mountains atthe double, as with an arrow bolting from a bow. [3-4-7b, 8a]"
3-54-8,"On reaching the ocean, a housing for sharks, alligators, a home of Rain-god, anever-draining deep and an ultimate course of the rivers, he hastily crossed it over. [3-54-8b,9a]"
3-54-9,"That ocean being the abode of Rain-god is highly flustered when Vaidehi is beingabducted over it, and its waves became topsy-turvy and its fishes and great marine-reptilesremained shilly-shally. [3-54-9b, 10a]"
3-54-10,"Then the siddha-s and caarana-s available in airspace averred saying, ""this alone isthe end of Decahedron Ravana."" [3-54-10b, 11a]"
3-54-11,"Ravana entered the city of Lanka transporting Seetha, while she wriggling in hisflank, who appeared like the personified death of Ravana wriggling its way into his Lanka.[3-54-11b, 12a]"
3-54-12,"On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, then he enteredhis own palace-chambers which is with very many doors and chambers thronging with crowds."
3-54-13,"On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, he then enteredhis own palace chambers in which royal servants are thronging at many doorways as that palace hasvery many chambers. [3-54-12b, 13a]"
3-54-14,"Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep inbewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya once kept hislady-love, a nymphet called Hema, in a demonic Black Hole."
3-54-15,"Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep inbewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya kept his demonicpower in a Black Hole."
3-54-16,"Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep inbewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya had once kept al hisdemonic scriptures duly usurping them from his own mentor, namely Shukracaarya, at an unknownillusory place. [3-54-13b, 14a]"
3-54-17,"That Decahedron Ravana also instructed the bogey-sightly bogeywomen, ""your watch andward shall be in such a way that neither a female nor a male can see Seetha impermissibly.""[3-54-14b, 15a]"
3-54-18,"Whatever she wishes to have, gold, jewels, pearls, apparels or adornments, they allbe given to her as you would give me according to my whimsies. [3-54-15b, 16a]"
3-54-19,"Whosoever speaks unpleasant words to Vaidehi in the least, either unknowingly orknowingly, her life becomes unpleasant for herself. Thus Ravana ordered the chamber-demonesses.[3-54-16b, 17a]"
3-54-20,"On speaking to those demonesses thus that chief of demons exited from that palacechamber, and giving a thought to what is to be done in sequel, then he gave audience to eighthighly vigorous demons, the feasters on raw-flesh. [3-54-17b, 18]"
3-54-21,"He who is egocentric by the boon awarded by Brahma for his invincibleness, thatRavana on giving an audience to those eight demons spoke this sentence to them praiseful of theirmight and valour. [3-54-19]"
3-54-22,"You immediately take up multiple assaultive weaponry and begone from here toJanasthaana speedily, a place now deadpanned for demons, which earlier was the placement of Khara.[3-54-20]"
3-54-23,"Throwaway your fright faraway and you stay in that Janasthaana which fell void asthe demons are voided by someone called Rama, and there you shall stay self-assuredly andself-confidently. [3-54-21]"
3-54-24,"Though highly forceful forces are deployed in Janasthaana, Rama's arrows haveutterly destroyed them, together with Khara and Duushana. [3-54-22]"
3-54-25,"Thereby an unprecedented fury is escalating over and above my courage, and anunhindered and unforgivable animosity towards that Rama is evoked in me. [3-54-23]"
3-54-26,"I wish to cast out my begrudging against my enemy who bears a grudge against me,and indeed, to me 'sleep' is not the word for it, until my enemy is undone in a war. [3-54-24]"
3-54-27,"I for myself will be comfortable only on eliminating him who has eliminated Kharaand Duushana as with a pauper acquiring riches. [3-54-25]"
3-54-28,"While you remain in Janasthaana you have to accurately bring me the informationabout Rama's activities and deportment. [3-54-26]"
3-54-29,"Do not go heedlessly, you all night-walkers, for that Rama appears to be toodangerous, and on your going there heedfully, you have to continually try for the elimination ofthat Raghava. [3-54-27]"
3-54-30,"I am aware of your might in battle fronts for a number of times, as such I havecommissioned you all in that Janasthaana. Thus Ravana spoke to those eight demons. [3-54-28]"
3-54-31,"Then on picking up those words amiable to all intents and purposes of Ravana, thoseeight demons departed from Lanka on hailing Ravana, and they collectively journeyed in thedirection of Janasthaana with their imperceivable appearances. [3-54-29]"
3-54-32,"Ravana is then highly gladdened well and truly on gaining over Seetha, and even forholding sway over that Maithili, and equally for the well-wrought and archly animosity with Rama,whereby that demon Ravana is hypocritically amused. [3-54-30]"
3-55-1,"On directing those eight ghastly demons Ravana is amused in his heart of hearts that he has accomplished a great feat. [3-55-1]"
3-55-2,"On continually musing upon Vaidehi Ravana is tormented with the arrows of Love-god, thereby to lay eyes on Seetha he post-hastily entered the beautiful palace. [3-55-2]"
3-55-3,"On entering the palace-chamber that supremo of demons beheld Seetha overwhelmed with ruefulness amongst demonesses. [3-55-3]"
3-55-4,"She whose visage is brimming over with tears, one browbeaten and downtrodden with the burden of bewail, one capsized like a boat that is about to capsize in an ocean spreadeagled with whirlwinds, and one alike an impala altogether swerved from its herd of impala yet hemmed in with dog-wolves, that nightwalker came nigh of such a Seetha whose face is downcast unwilling to see any, and to such a pitiable Seetha who is in the shackles of her sorrow, that supremo of demons compellingly started to show his palace which is similar to any paradisiacal palace. [3-55-4, 5, 6]"
3-55-5,"That paradisiacal mansion house of Decahedral Ravana is congestive with innumerable cupolaed skyscrapers, adored with thousands of females, frequented by diverse bevies of birds, and it comprised of numerous gemstones. The pillars are amazingly gilded with engraving of ivory, gilt, quartz, silvern linocuts, and they are even embossed with diamonds and with lapis gems, which are heart-pleasing for a look. The drumbeats of divine drums are echoing in entire palace, and its archways are adorned with the gildings of pure gold. [3-55-7, 8, 9a]"
3-55-6,"Ravana walked up the wonderful golden staircase along with Seetha, and the rows of skyscrapers with windows that are ivoried and silvered and with window-blinds are seen from the windows of the landing on that flight of stairs, which are also ivoried and silvered windows with window-blinds, and all are amusing for sight. [3-55-9b, 10]"
3-55-7,"That Decahedral Ravana displayed the multiple stories of his own palace which is all over white-marbled and diamond encrusted to Maithili. [3-55-11]"
3-55-8,"Ravana continued to display the descendible wellsprings and leisure pools from which diverse flowers have sprung and overspread them, regardless of Seetha&#39;s languishing under her anguish. [3-55-12]"
3-55-9,"On flaunting his best palace in its entirety to Vaidehi that dirty-minded Ravana spoke this sentence to Seetha in order that she may be tempted on her own, lustily. [3-55-13]"
3-55-10,"Oh, Seetha, ten crores of first-rated demons are there, furthermore, twenty-two crores of demons of ghastly exploits are there, thus all put together, three hundred twenty millions of demons are there in Lanka, omitting the weakish, oldish, youngish demons. For all of them I am the lord. Thus Ravana started his self-eulogy. [3-55-14, 15a]"
3-55-11,"For every single work of mine a thousand servitors will rush in. Such as I am I pledge entire life of mine along with the suzerainty of this sovereign city-state Lanka to you, oh, broad-eyed lady, for you are loftier than my lives. [3-55-15b, 16]"
3-55-12,"Oh, Seetha, you will become an empress for all of the those countless females of finest fabric amassed by me, oh, dear, if only you marry me. [3-55-17]"
3-55-13,"You be keen on my amiable words and it will be apt of you to show compassion on me, for I have burning desire for you, and of what use is your thinking conversely about that long-lost Rama? [3-55-18]"
3-55-14,"It is impossible to assail this Lanka even for Indra with all of the gods and demons, as an ocean roundly enshrouds this Lanka which is hundred-yojana-s witdthwise. [3-55-19]"
3-55-15,"I behold none matchable to my vitality is existent among gods; among yaksha-s - no; among gandharva-s - no; among sages - no, nor anyone in any world. [3-55-20]"
3-55-16,"What can you achieve with that dethroned, hapless, seer, vagrant Rama who is short-lived, for after all, he is a human with littlest vitality? [3-55-21]"
3-55-17,"Oh, Seetha, you apotheosise me only for I am your seemliest husband, oh, jumpy lady, indeed, primeness has impermanence, thus here you be blithesome with me. [3-55-22]"
3-55-18,"Oh, beautifully visaged lady, it is needless to have half a mind to see that Raghava, oh, Seetha, even if his wits chariot him what is his calibre to come thither crossing an un-crossable ocean? [3-55-23]"
3-55-19,"It is impossible to knot the currents of cyclonic gusts in mid air, more so, it is impracticable to lay hold on the tongues of radiately irradiant fire. [3-55-24]"
3-55-20,"Oh, benefactress of bliss, he who can lead you back with his valour, while you are being fended off by my mighty arms, him I do not envisage even in any one world of this threefold world. [3-55-25]"
3-55-21,"You rule over this very great empire of Lanka as an empress of Lanka, while me and mine, also thus all gods like me who hitherto are under my rule, and all mobile and sessile entities of whom I am the ruler, they too will hereafter make ourselves useful as your royal stewards, if you marry me. [3-55-26]"
3-55-22,"Wet with the waters of anointment you be elated and then delight me. By your damnable dwelling in forests bygone is your bad-luck that you misdealt in bygone times. And what dutiable good deed is to be done by you in marrying me, you do that now, and secure the fruits of that good deed here by marrying me. [3-55-27, 28a]"
3-55-23,"Oh, Maithili, here all the garlands are divinely fragranced and the jewellery is topmost, you will dress up with them along with me should you become my wife. [3-55-28b]"
3-55-24,"Oh, well-waisted lady, just by my might I notched up an aircraft known as Pushpaka from my brother Kubera in a war with him, which is similar sun in its shine. [3-55-29b. 30a]"
3-55-25,"That aircraft is expansive and exhilarating, also its speed is on par with intuition, oh, Seetha, in that you can cheerfully fly about along with me, should you marry me. [3-55-30b, 31a]"
3-55-26,"Oh, lady with a comely countenance, your visage is lotus similar in its shine, besides being immaculate, fairish and eyeful, but oh, curvaceous lady, with such a mushily maudlin of such a face this palace of mine is unbright, thus marry me to brighten everything Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-55-31b, 32a]"
3-55-27,"While Ravana is speaking to her in this way that graceful lady Seetha veiled her moonier face with fringe of her sari, and stiflingly dispelled tears on that mooniest face behind her half-veil. [3-55-32b, 33a]"
3-55-28,"To her who is disconcerted and whose anguish marred her brilliance and who is appearing as though pondering over the question of her submittal to Ravana, or otherwise, although she is meditating, to such a Seetha Ravana the nightwalker said these words. [3-55-33b, 34a]"
3-55-29,"Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental to scriptural canons, oh, empress, what that is approaching you in the form of queen-hood is absolutely compatible with the tradition."
3-55-30,"Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental to scriptural canons, what that is approaching you in the mode of queen-hood is ordained by gods and it is absolutely traditional. [3-55-34b, 35a]"
3-55-31,"Let these two feet of yours be massaged by my ten heads, do me favour readily, for I am your subordinate and servant. [3-55-35b. 36a]"
3-55-32,"I with a lustful hollow-heart spoke all these hollow words that are unbefitting to my stature, indeed, Ravana will never supplicate headlong to whosoever woman. [3-55-36b, 36c]"
3-55-33,"That Decahedral Ravana on speaking thus to Maithili, who is the daughter of Janaka, deemed that &#39;she is mine,&#39; as he has gone under the sway of the Terminator. [3-55-37]"
3-56-1,"She that Vaidehi who is haggard by anguish boldly spoke to Ravana when he addressed her in that way, duly placing a blade of straw in between herself and Ravana. [3-56-1]"
3-56-2,"He whose son is Raghava, is a resolute king known as Dasharatha. That king is a kingly rampart for righteousness, a kingpin abiding in forthrightness and thereby his kingliness is well renowned in all worlds, and my husband Rama is such a king&#39;s son. [3-56-2]"
3-56-3,"Such a Dasharatha&#39;s son who is virtue-souled one, who is highly renowned in all the three worlds for his ambidexterity and perspicacity, and who is known as Rama is my husband and a god to me. [3-56-3]"
3-56-4,"He who took birth in Ikshvaku&#39;s dynasty is a great-resplendent one with his shoulders like those of a lion, and who comes here along with similarly lion-shouldered and nearly great-resplendent brother of his, namely Lakshmana, to take your lives away. Such Rama is my husband. [3-56-4]"
3-56-5,"Had I been forcibly humiliated by you in the presence of Rama, you too would have been killed by Rama in combat and by now you too would be sprawling on earth, as with Khara in Janasthaana, but you foxed him. However, such Rama is my husband. [3-56-5]"
3-56-6,"Those demons who are spoken of you to be with ghastly forms and gruelling power, they all will become formless and powerless in face of Raghava, as with all snakes becoming non-poisonous earthworms in the face of Garuda, the Divine Eagle. Such Rama is my husband. [3-56-6]"
3-56-7,"Those gilded arrows of Rama unloosened directly and unswervingly from his bowstring will utterly batter your body, as the waves of River Ganga will be battering that river&#39;s riverbanks. Such Rama is my husband. [3-56-7]"
3-56-8,"Even if you are unkillable either by gods or by demons, you Ravana, you will not be disenthralled by Rama while you are alive, for you hatched a very great animosity in him against you. [3-56-8]"
3-56-9,"That mighty Rama will become the terminator of the vestige of your life, and as with an animal fastened to the stake of sacrifice your life too will become irretrievable. [3-56-9]"
3-56-10,"If he that Rama glances you with his rancour-torched eyes, you demon, you will be completely burnt down now itself, as with Love-god burnt down by Furious Shiva. [3-56-10]"
3-56-11,"He that Rama who hurls down the moon from skies onto earth, or else extirpates it if need be, or even desiccates an ocean, he alone rescues Seetha from here. [3-56-11]"
3-56-12,"Gone is your liveability, gone is your prosperity, gone is your vivacity, and gone is your faculty. Thus Lanka is widowed by a single deed of yours. [3-56-12]"
3-56-13,"In forest you have separated me from the propinquity of my husband, which diabolic deed of yours will not result in any ultimate happiness for you. [3-56-13]"
3-56-14,"In fact, that great-resplendent husband of mine, Rama, is still residing in the eremitical Dandaka forest, bravely hinging on to his own valour, in tandem only with my brother-in-law. [3-56-14]"
3-56-15,"With storms of his arrows in a given combat my husband will dislodge arrogance, insolence, puissance, like that impudence from every limb of yours. [3-56-15]"
3-56-16,"As and when ruination of created beings manifests actuated by Time, then all of them will place their behaviour in endangerment, as they have gone under the control of End-Time. [3-56-16]"
3-56-17,"This is that time which has bechanced on you owing to your molesting me, you basely demon, by which time-factor yourself, all of your demons, and even all of your queens in the Chambers of Queens will be devastated. [3-56-17]"
3-56-18,"It is impossible for a profaner to heavily tread on the Altar of Fire amidst a Ritual Hall surrounded by oblational vessels, further sanctified by Vedic hymns. [3-56-18]"
3-56-19,"Likewise, I am the solemnly pledged legitimate wife of one who steadied himself in righteousness, and such as I am, you basely demon, it is impossible for you trespasser to touch me even. [3-56-19]"
3-56-20,"How a she-swan ever frolicking with majestic swans in bunches of lotuses can leer at a water-crow sneaking in a bunch of grass? [3-56-20]"
3-56-21,"Oh, demon, you may either trammel or vandalise this inertial body of mine. I claim neither this body nor life of mine as my own. But I am intolerant to bear with any disrepute on this earth. Thus Seetha castigated Ravana. [3-56-21, 22a]"
3-56-22,"Vaidehi on speaking those highly caustic words angrily to Ravana in this way, she that Maithili spoke no more in that matter. [3-56-22b, 23a]"
3-56-23,"On hearing Seetha&#39;s scathing and hair-raising censures, then Ravana retorted with these intimidatory chides. [3-56-23b, 24a]"
3-56-24,"Oh, angry lady Maithili, listen to my words. A period of twelve months is given to you. And oh, smiley smiler, if you do not come nigh of me within that period, then the cooks will slice you to pieces for the purpose of a morning meal. [3-56-24b, 25]"
3-56-25,"Thus on saying those harsh words, Ravana, the one who makes his enemies to bewail, and who is now infuriated said this sentence to the guarding demonesses. [3-56-26]"
3-56-26,"Oh, gnarled demonesses of grisly mien and devourers of meat and blood, you have to indeed remove her pride immediately. [3-56-27]"
3-56-27,"Just by that order of Ravana those demonesses of grotesque and ugly appearance have obediently made palm-fold to him and encircled Maithili. [3-56-28]"
3-56-28,"That king Ravana paced in an earth-shattering manner as though to cleave it and clearly said this to those demonesses with ghastly look. [3-56-29]"
3-56-29,"Let this Maithili be taken to the centre of Ashoka gardens, where you all shall blockade and guard her stealthily. [3-56-30]"
3-56-30,"You threaten her with dreadful admonitions and again speaking imploringly you all have to bring her under control, as a wild she-elephant of age will be brought under control. [3-56-31]"
3-56-31,"When Ravana has clearly ordered, those demonesses on their part took Maithili to Ashoka garden. That Ashoka gardens are surrounded with trees that yield fruits to every savour, and now they are diversely flowered and fruited. Further, those gardens are highly adored by all-time lusty birds. [3-56-32, 33]"
3-56-32,"But she that Janaka&#39;s daughter Maithili whose body is with a coverall of anguish, further on obtaining the control of demonesses, she is as good as a she-deer under the coverall of tigresses. [3-56-34]"
3-56-33,"Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, who is already consumed by utmost agony has not obtained any placidity now as with a she-deer bound by tether - where timorousness is common to both. [3-56-35]"
3-56-34,"Maithili knows no peace when the bizarre-eyed demonesses have highly intimidated her, and by shut-seeing those demonesses her reminiscences went over to her dear husband and about her brother-in-law Lakshmana too, and when she felt about the improbability of their coming here, she is distraught with alarm and anguish, and then she swooned. [3-56-36]"
3-57-1,"Rama on killing that demon Maareecha, who is a guise changer at his wish and who moved about in the guise of a deer, instantly started to return on the trail by which he trailed after that deer-demon. [3-57-1]"
3-57-2,"While Rama is anxiously hurrying to see Maithili, then a brutish voiced jackal deafeningly howled at his behind. [3-57-2]"
3-57-3,"On hearing that threatening and hair-raising howl of jackal Rama is overly threatened just by the tone of fox in which it is foreboding, inasmuch as the forbidding intoning of Maareecha. [3-57-3]"
3-57-4,"Huh! As to how this jackal has howled I deem that as inauspicious. As yet undevoured by demons would Vaidehi be safe? [3-57-4]"
3-57-5,"On knowing the nature of my voice Maareecha in the semblance of a deer yelled out mimicking my voice. If Lakshmana listens that voice, recognising it as my voice he will instantly rush to my near. Else if Maithili listens, she will hasten him to go over here and Soumitri instantly rushes here leaving her off. [3-57-5, 6]"
3-57-6,"As could be seen from Maareecha&#39;s becoming a Golden Deer only to sidetrack and take me away from hermitage, his becoming a demon when hit with an arrow, and his shouting words indeed like, &#39;ha, Lakshmana, ha, Seetha, I am killed,&#39; the demons are collectively intending to do away with Seetha. It is certain. [3-57-7, 8]"
3-57-7,"Whether there will be safety in forest for those two in my absence, or not, is my doubt. Owing to my devastating Janasthaana I have become a harboured grudge for demons, am not I! As such, foretokens are appearing now, severely and severally. Thus Rama&#39;s thoughts have sprinted. [3-57-9, 10a]"
3-57-8,"When that soulful Rama has heard the whistle of jackal while returning, he persistently thought in this way about his detour caused by demon in the disguise of a deer, thus he speedily advanced towards his hermitage. [3-57-10b, 11]"
3-57-9,"Raghava came to Janasthaana doubting overly, and the animals and birds of Janasthaana which look doleful have neared him whose heart has become doleful. [3-57-12]"
3-57-10,"Those doleful animals and birds moving in circumambulations from the left side to right of that noble-souled Rama they let off frightening shrieks, and then observing those highly forbidding foretokens Rama returned to his own hermitage hastily and hurriedly. [3-57-13]"
3-57-11,"Then Rama saw Lakshmana coming towards him with a lacklustre face, and then Lakshmana, who is melancholic and anguishing in his divergence from Seetha, met Rama not a long-way-off, where Rama is a similar partaker in melancholy and anguishing by way of his convergence upon ill-omens. [3-57-14, 15a]"
3-57-12,"On seeing Lakshmana who has arrived at this place leaving off Seetha in a forest that is desolate, more so an adorable forest for demons, Rama reproached him as his elder brother. [3-57-15b, 16a]"
3-57-13,"Taking Lakshmana&#39;s left hand into his, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, alike a bewailer spoke this brusque speech that has a mellowly fruition in future. [3-57-16b, 17a]"
3-57-14,"You have done a deplorable deed in coming here forsaking Seetha. Now, oh, gentle Lakshmana, are we somewhat safe, or everything has already gone astray now itself, or what. [3-57-17b, 18a]"
3-57-15,"Oh, brave one, according to these many inauspicious forebodings that have manifested themselves to me, we might have lost Janaka&#39;s daughter Seetha, or the forest ranging demons might have devoured her, or else they might have kidnapped her, I am doubtless about it. [3-57-18b, 19]"
3-57-16,"Oh, tigerly-man Lakshmana, I wonder whether we can at least make out the daughter of Janaka Seetha in her intactness and aliveness. [3-57-20]"
3-57-17,"On observing these mobs of deer, this jackal, also even these birds which are voicing noisily facing the direction lit by the sun, oh, great-mighty Lakshmana, can we presume that there will be safety to that princes Seetha? [3-57-21]"
3-57-18,"This very demon in his likeness to a deer led me on and led me off distantly as I was indeed following him, and by an intense effort somehow he was killed, and when dying he transfigured into a demon. [3-57-22]"
3-57-19,"Now even my heart is woeful and I am woebegone, my left eye is also fluttering erratically, oh, Lakshmana, no doubt Seetha is not there in hermitage, maybe she is whisked away, or, wiped out, or, wandering around on a wrong way. [3-57-23]"
3-58-1,"On seeing dreary Lakshmana coming into the void of forest devoid of Vaidehi, then the virtue-souled Rama, the son of Dasharatha, has asked him impatiently. [3-58-1]"
3-58-2,"She who has come in tow with me to Dandaka forest when I started for peregrination, whom you have now deserted and came here, oh, Lakshmana, she that Vaidehi, where is she? [3-58-2]"
3-58-3,"When I have become forlorn with the forfeiture of my kingdom and when I was rushing for Dandaka forest she stood with me as a partaker in my woes. She that comely Vaidehi, where is she? [3-58-3]"
3-58-4,"Without whom I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, valiant one, such a Seetha who in simile is like the daughter of deities and who is my life-force, where is she? [3-58-4]"
3-58-5,"I am unambitious for the rulership either on heavens or on the earth, oh, Lakshmana, without the daughter of Janaka whose aspect glisters like gold. [3-58-5]"
3-58-6,"Vaidehi who is dearer to me than my lives, will she be alive somehow! Oh, valiant Lakshmana, this peregrination of mine, will it not become futile, someway! [3-58-6]"
3-58-7,"When I am dead for the sake of Seetha and when you get back to Ayodhya lonesomely, and when Kaikeyi&#39;s wishes are accomplished thus, oh, Soumitri, will she be comfortable, somewhat! [3-58-7]"
3-58-8,"Kaikeyi is with her son, with a kingdom, and further her &#39;purposes are achieved,&#39; oh, gentle Lakshmana, and because of the death of her son will my austerely mother Kausalya humbly get into the servitude of Kaikeyi, anyhow! [3-58-8]"
3-58-9,"I wish to get at the hermitage again if only that Vaidehi of good-conduct is alive in hermitage, else, oh, Lakshmana, if death has already conducted her out of hermitage I too will give up my lives here itself. [3-58-9]"
3-58-10,"If Seetha, the princess from Videha, does not chat with me as before smiling gleefully on my arrival at the hermitage, oh, Lakshmana, I really breath my last. [3-58-10]"
3-58-11,"Say Lakshmana, whether that pietistic Vaidehi is alive or not? Or, on your becoming unmindful of your guard is she consumed by demons, either? [3-58-11]"
3-58-12,"She who is softish by her nature and youngish by her age has never noticed the despair of separation from me, and now by my dissociation she will be despairing brokenheartedly, so it seems. [3-58-12]"
3-58-13,"That impostor and highly impudent demon Maareecha who shouted loudly as, &#39;oh, Lakshmana,&#39; might have caused fear even in you in everyway. [3-58-13]"
3-58-14,"I hope that Vaidehi has also heard that voice which is similar to that of mine, and I hope frightened as she is she might have also hastened you, and I hope you also have come to see me, that hastily! [3-58-14]"
3-58-15,"In everyway you have caused hardship by leaving Seetha in isolation, and a leeway is given to the diabolical demons for a counterattack against us. [3-58-15]"
3-58-16,"Raw-flesh eating demons are distraught as I have liquidated Khara, as a result those ghastly ones would have liquidated Seetha by now. There is no doubt about it. [3-58-16]"
3-58-17,"In everyway I am sunken in scourge, but oh, enemy-eliminator Lakshmana, what I can possibly do in present situation? Perchance, this sort of scourge is liable to chance upon me, alas! Thus Rama gave vent to his feelings on his way to hermitage. [3-58-17]"
3-58-18,"In this way while thinking emotively about that curvaceous Seetha, Raghava hurriedly returned to Janasthaana along with Lakshmana. [3-58-18]"
3-58-19,"He that Rama who chastened his younger brother en route is worried in aspect and wizened is his mouth by hunger, by strain, and also thus by thirst, and suspiring heavily he arrived near at hermitage, and became dispirited when he beheld the hermitage in vacuity. That valiant Rama on quickly entering his own hermitage found it to be vacuous. Then he rushed out and went round a place of pastime of Seetha, saying &#39;yes, this is that place where she used to move round for plucking flowers.&#39; And again he dashed in to hermitage only to find it as an empty cottage. Then he rushed out to some other place of playtime of Seetha yelling, &#39;yes, this is that place where she used play with deer, squirrels and birds.&#39; And again came back to vacant hermitage, and again he dashed to some other prayer-time place exclaiming, &#39;yes, this is that very place where she offered her daily prayers.&#39; Finally on returning to the vacant hermitage he became one who is plunged into hair-raising throes of despair as that cottage is emptied of Seetha. [3-58-19, 20]"
3-59-1,"The content of this chapter is to amplify what that has been said in the previous chapter. This dialogue between Rama and Lakshmana may be deemed to have happened before their approaching hermitage, as in the last few verses of last chapter, and on their pathway to their hermitage."
3-59-2,"Rama the descendent of Raghu, again asked Soumitri who strayed from the hermitage and whom his own anguish is distressing now, in the middle of path towards their hermitage. [3-59-1]"
3-59-3,"Rama spoke to such Lakshmana, when I left her in the forest, I left only on confiding in you. For what reason you came to me on abandoning Maithili? [3-59-2]"
3-59-4,"What my heart had been doubting, rather a perilous evil, oh, Lakshmana, that has become a fact on seeing only you, coming to me leaving off Maithili. [3-59-3]"
3-59-5,"Seeing your coming without Seetha on pathway at a distance my left eye and left shoulder have pulsated, and oh, Lakshmana, my heart too has fluttered. Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [3-59-4]"
3-59-6,"When Sumitra&#39;s son Lakshmana, whose traits are blamelessly auspicious is addressed thus, anguish cast a double spell on him, one for the tongue-lashing of Seetha while the other for the reproach from Rama, and he replied Rama who is anguished in his own way. [3-59-5]"
3-59-7,"I have not come here leaving her off either independently or intentionally, I came here, to your proximity, virtually driven by her hurtful words. Thus Lakshmana is relying Rama. [3-59-6]"
3-59-8,"Maithili gave an ear to that message which is loudly shouted as if by your honour saying, &#39;ha, Seetha... ha, Lakshmana... save me immediately...&#39; [3-59-7]"
3-59-9,"On hearing that grievous voice of yours and owing to her love for you she shuddered with fear and wept out to me &#39;hurry up...get going...&#39; [3-59-8]"
3-59-10,"When she frequently and insistingly compelled me to go, I have replied Maithili in this sentence which is expressive of my confidence in you. [3-59-9]"
3-59-11," &#39;I do no think that there is a demon who can cause panic to Rama. All this is feigning. Someone might have typified his voice in this way, please control yourself. [3-59-10]"
3-59-12," &#39;How can my esteemed brother who can safeguard even gods, oh, Seetha, will exclaim in saying, &#39;save me,&#39; which is a highly disparaging and basely manner to call for the help of a lady to safeguard him in such circumstances. [3-59-11]"
3-59-13," &#39;But, somehow, for some reason, someone mimicking my brother&#39;s voice discordantly shouted words saying, &#39;Lakshmana save me.&#39; [3-59-12]"
3-59-14," &#39;Oh, auspicious lady, it is unbefitting for you to panic, like lowly womenfolk who will be frivolously panicking for flimsy reasons, for the words like &#39;save me,&#39; shouted by some demon, who may conceivably be Maareecha. [3-59-13]"
3-59-15," &#39;Enough is your slipping into consternation and you be undismayed. There is none in all the three worlds who took birth, or going to take birth, to defeat Raghava in any given battle of any terrible nature. Raghava is undefeatable even if all gods come battling along with Indra in their van.&#39; This is what I said to Vaidehi Thus Lakshmana is informing Rama. [3-59-14, 15]"
3-59-16,"Though I said thus, while her volition is overly besotted for you, Vaidehi said this tartly word to me outpouring tears. [3-59-16]"
3-59-17," &#39;In my respect you have harboured only an impure and nastily perspective to achieve me on the utter ruination of your brother, but I am unachievable to you. [3-59-17]"
3-59-18," &#39;As to why you are refraining to rush towards Rama even though he is inordinately yelling, it hints that Bharata made some arrangements with you, and that is the reason why you have closely followed Rama in exile. [3-59-18]"
3-59-19," &#39;You are an adversary of Rama comporting yourself in disguise, following him because of me, and searching for a leeway from Rama. Thereby now you are not rushing to Rama. [3-59-19]"
3-59-20,"When Vaidehi spoke to me thus I hurriedly came out of hermitage to you with anger reddening my eyes and trembling my lips. [3-59-20]"
3-59-21,"Rama who is deluded by angst said to Soumitri who is speaking thus, that your arrival without her is an improper deed, oh, gentle one. [3-59-21]"
3-59-22,"You know that I am capable enough to foil the demons, even then you have come out by the angry words of Maithili? [3-59-22]"
3-59-23,"On hearing bitter words of an angry lady you have came away on leaving her off, such as you are, I am not at all happy with you. [3-59-23]"
3-59-24,"That which action of yours is there in non-compliance of my directive to stand guard to Seetha, either compelled by Seetha, or coming under your own ire, it shows your dereliction in everyway. [3-59-24]"
3-59-25,"By whom I am detoured from hermitage in the form of a deer he is indeed a demon, and he fell flat when my arrow hit him down. [3-59-25]"
3-59-26,"When I effortlessly shot an arrow setting on bowstring and stretching the bow to full length, he hit by that arrow left deer&#39;s body to become a piteously bewailing demon wearing bracelets and the like ornaments. [3-59-26]"
3-59-27,"Then hit down by arrow thus, he with an anguished voice that is clearly audible at a very remotely place and that which is mimicking my voice, uttered those highly gruesome words, whereby you have come here forsaking Maithili. Thus Rama said to Lakshmana on their way to their hermitage. [3-59-27]"
3-60-1,"While Rama is coming towards hermitage his lower eyelid frequently fluttered, his gait faltered, and he missed his footing. [3-60-1]"
3-60-2,"On closely watching those inauspicious forebodings Rama indeed uttered oftentimes reflexly thus as, &#39;would she be safe, in fact!&#39; [3-60-2]"
3-60-3,"He quickened himself and went with an ardency to see Seetha, and then on seeing an empty home his heart is distraught. [3-60-3]"
3-60-4,"Raghava looked like a flying-flutterer as his speed jostled his arms and gait flutteringly, and on closely probing there and there, and all-over the places of that cottage, then he saw the lustreless house of straw devoid of Seetha, alike a befogged wintry lotus-lake without lustre. [3-60-4, 5]"
3-60-5,"The trees of that woodland are seemingly weeping, as their flowers are witheringly weakening and their birds are weepingly warbling, and the animals are whingeingly weeping, and that woodland is charmless and utterly shattered, since its georgic deities have completely abandoned it. Rather utterly bestrewn are the deerskins and sacred grass blades, rather utterly battered are the tender-grass-seats and other mats in the compound of cottage, and he who ardently wanted to see Seetha, such a Rama, on seeing such an emptied locale and cottage, wept over, over and again. [3-60-6, 7]"
3-60-6,"That bashful Seetha might be stolen by the grudging demons, or slain by the very same grisly demons, or savoured by some gruesome beasts, or else she strayed in this gauntly forest, and even she might have playfully shrouded herself in the grimly forest, or else she must be sheltering herself in this forest which will be gruelling to locate. [3-60-8]"
3-60-7,"Or else, she might have again gone to pick the flowers or fruits, or again gone to lotus-lake, or gone to the river for water. Thinking thus, Rama started his search for Seetha. [3-60-9]"
3-60-8,"Though he searched effortfully for his dear Seetha he did not get her, and as his anguish is reddening his eyes the appearance of that glorious one seems to be that of a madman. [3-60-10]"
3-60-9,"Rama ran speedily from tree to shrub, from hill to hillock, from river to rivulet, and revolving around them he wailed for Seetha, as he is inundated in a sludgy ocean of woes. [3-60-11]"
3-60-10,"Oh, Kadamba tree, seest thou someone a lady who is lover of Kadamba flowers, one with a lovable face and a love of mine, thou tellest me if thou knowest. [3-60-12]"
3-60-11,"Oh, Bilva tree, if thou seest someone who is drest in yellowy-ochry silks, whose skin likens to the silkiness of thine leaflets, breasts to thine rotund and silky Bilva fruits, thou tellest me... [3-60-13]"
3-60-12,"Otherwise, thou Arjuna tree, if thou knowest her who is a lover of thine Arjuna flowers and the ladylove of mine, thou telleth whether that slender-waisted daughter of Janaka liveth or otherwise... [3-60-14]"
3-60-13,"As to how this Kakubha tree shineth laden with creepy-creepers, foliole-foliage and flowery-flowers, this tree knowest Maithili whose thighs can be likened to the smoothish trunk of this very Kakubha tree... [3-60-15]"
3-60-14,"As to how this best tree among all trees heareth the chorus of honeybees that singest around it, thereby this Tilaka tree clearly knowest Maithili, a lover of Tilaka trees, as this shouldst have heard her. [3-60-16]"
3-60-15,"Oh, Ashoka tree, an alleviator of agony, that is thine name lingually... but practically and readily name me after thine, by showing my ladylove, as my agony has marred my empathy... [3-60-17]"
3-60-16,"Oh, Palm tree, if thou seest that lady breasted alike ripened-palm fruits of thine, and if thine mercy is mine, thou telleth of that shapely lady Seetha... [3-60-18]"
3-60-17,"Oh, Rose-apple tree, if thou seest Seetha and thee knowest my ladylove with golden glitter, thou telleth me without hesitation..."
3-60-18,"Oh, Rose-apple tree, if thou seest Seetha and thou knowest my ladylove whose complexion is smoothish like thine Rose-apples, thou telleth me unhesitatingly... [3-60-19]"
3-60-19,"Aha! Karnikaara tree, now thou art in full bloom and blooming magnificently, if thou seest that lover of Karnikaara-flowers and an immaculate ladylove of mine, thou telleth me... [3-60-20]"
3-60-20,"Rama has gone on asking trees like mango, niipa, massive saala, jack-fruit, kuruva, dhava, and even around daaDima, bakula, punnaaga, sandalwood, ketaka trees, and when he is running around them that highly glorious Rama appeared like a madman. [3-60-21, 22]"
3-60-21,"Or else, oh, deer, dost thou know what bechanced to that fawn-eyed Maithili, one with quick-looks like thee deer? Or else, hast she herded herself into the herd of she-deer of yours... [3-60-23]"
3-60-22,"Oh, elephant, thou mightst beheld her whose thighs likens to your trunk at that problematic hour, thus methinks, and that Maithili is familiar to thee, and oh, best elephant, if thou beholdest her, thou tallest me... [3-60-24]"
3-60-23,"Fear not, oh, tiger, hast thou seen Maithili, the moonfaced ladylove of mine, if thou hast seen speak in good faith... [3-60-25]"
3-60-24,"Oh lotus-eyed lady, in fact I have seen you my dear, then why this running away and concealing yourself under trees, why do not you reply me... [3-60-26]"
3-60-25,"Stay...stay... oh, best lady, don&#39;t you have mercy on me? You are not unacceptably tease-humoured! What for you ignore me? [3-60-27]"
3-60-26,"Oh, beautifully complexioned lady, even if you are running away your yellowy silk-sari betokens you, stay, if you have goodwill for me... [3-60-28]"
3-60-27,"Otherwise, she whom I have just seen me may not be Seetha, why because, it is unapt of her to avoid me who attained this wretched state, hence Seetha with cheery smiles is certainly murdered... [3-60-29]"
3-60-28,"Obviously the raw-flesh gorgers must have gorged that youngish lady on diving all her limbs in my absence from my dear one... [3-60-30]"
3-60-29,"Her face which is similar to a full-moon with pretty teeth, prettier lips, prettily nose and with prettyish earrings, might have obtained a blanched look when being devoured... [3-60-31]"
3-60-30,"But that exquisite and beautiful neck of that lady which shines forth in the colour of Campaka flower, befitting for any neck ornament, indeed it might be glutted down while she is bewailing... [3-60-32]"
3-60-31,"Her two arms which are delicate like tender leaves, ornamented with bangles and bicep-lets might have been definitely nibbled while they are wriggling with quivering fingers... [3-60-33]"
3-60-32,"This is as though I have forsaken this youngish Seetha really as a feast for the demons in my absence, and though Seetha has many relatives she has become as worse as a lonesome woman who is completely forsaken by her caravan who is lonesomely ready for the feast of highwaymen, and demons have feasted on her. [3-60-34]"
3-60-33,"Ha, Lakshmana... oh, dextrous one... have you seen my ladylove anywhere... ha, dear, where have you gone... oh, auspicious lady... ha, Seetha... thus Rama lamented again and again in his search. [3-60-35]"
3-60-34,"On bewailing in this way and on overly rushing from wood to wood, somewhere Rama has become highly delusional by the forcefulness of delusion and spots forest stuff as Seetha, though none of them have any resemblance to Seetha, and somewhere else, marking creepers, plants or slender shrubs and suchlike delicacies as Seetha he has become really alluded by the powerfulness of allusion, and elsewhere, he is not discriminating paths or pathless routes for his trekking as an impassioned one in the search of his ladylove, and thus he is nitid like a madman. [3-60-36, 37a]"
3-60-35,"Rama is on the rove around woods, rivers, hills, mountain-rapids and thicketed forests, speedily and restlessly. [3-60-37]"
3-60-36,"On going round the vast of great forest in that way and on searching for Maithili, his hope became intangible, but again he undertook the search for his ladylove, over-strenuously. [3-60-38]"
3-61-1,"From here, until Rama meets Hanuma in next book Kishkindha, Rama&#39;s lamentation is continually portrayed. This may not be taken as a mere &#39;weeping&#39; or &#39;bemoaning&#39; of the principal character of the epic, but this has many poetics and romantics of epical poetry imbibed in it. An epic, basically, requires a hero to have his romantic attributes, <font color=""#B3003A"">naayaka lakshaNaaH</font> and these &#39;wailings&#39; will portray all of them. There are various, numerous and voluminous derivatives, meanings and commentaries, which cannot possibly be included in here, at this stage, except for passing references on them. Hence, this lengthy lamentation has lengthier romanticism."
3-61-2,"On seeing the vacant threshold of the hermitage and empty cottage of straw, also at the leaf-mat-seats that are utterly shattered, and not finding Vaidehi even on watchfully eyeing everywhere Rama shrieked loudly, and then on clasping the winning shoulders of Lakshmana he said this to him. [3-61-1, 2]"
3-61-3,"Oh, Lakshmana, possibly where can be Vaidehi? Or, to which place she has gone from here? Or, Soumitri, who stole her away? Or, who has gorged up my ladylove? [3-61-3]"
3-61-4,"Oh, Seetha, if you have concealed yourself under trees wishing to poke fun at me, enough is your fun and games, get in touch with me now, as I am highly anguished... [3-61-4]"
3-61-5,"Oh, meek Seetha, with which meekly young deer you were playing, all these are now broody with tearfully fluttery looks, without you... [3-61-5]"
3-61-6,"Really Lakshmana, I will not live long without Seetha, indeed I am enveloped in high anguish caused by the abduction of Seetha, and this alone will become a murderer, and on my going to other world when murdered by my own agony my father and that great king Dasharatha will definitely observe me in the other world... [3-61-6, 7a]"
3-61-7,"When I go to other world after my death our father Dasharatha who is already staying there will deride me saying, &#39;when I have directed you for a fourteen year exile, and when you too have assuredly agreed and promised me for that term, how you have to my presence in this ultramundane world without completing that term of fourteen year exile, besides breaking your own word of honour... thus you have become a wilful disobedient, despicable and dishonest person, such as you are, fie on you...&#39; [3-61-7b, 8, 9a]"
3-61-8,"Anguish seared and bewildered me and I am woebegone with broken down buoyancy, and oh, beautiful lady, jilting such an woeful one as I am, where you are going now, as with prestige jilting a prevaricator? And if you shun me I will have to shun my life... Thus Rama bewailed imaging her right in his front and running away. [3-61-9b, 10, 11a]"
3-61-9,"Though that legatee of Raghu is desperate for seeing Seetha, though he is highly anguished and agonised, though he bewailed this way, that Rama has not found Janaka&#39;s daughter, Seetha. [3-61-10b, 11a]"
3-61-10,"To him who is unable to find Seetha, and who is sinking in sadness as with an elephant sinking in a chasmal mud, Lakshmana spoke to such a Rama in a positive manner desiring his wellbeing. [3-61-11b, 13]"
3-61-11,"Oh, well-informed one, do not get into desperation, you make efforts along with me, and oh, brave one, this best mountain is beaming forth with many caves, she may be there somewhere. [3-61-14]"
3-61-12,"Maithili is a fascinated saunterer in woodlands so she might have entered the forest, she is even infatuated with waters, so she might have gone to the fully bloomed lotus-lake, or to the river that is adorned by fishes and cane-breaks. [3-61-15]"
3-61-13,"Or, wishing to know our reaction when she scares us with her prank, Maithili might have squirreled away into forest. Oh, honourable brother, let us endeavour quickly to search her. [3-61-16]"
3-61-14,"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, if you consider that we shall search the forest in its entirety to locate where she that Janaka&#39;s daughter might be, let us quickly do so. But do not engulf your heart in sadness. Thus Lakshmana advised Rama. [3-61-18]"
3-61-15,"When Lakshmana good-heartedly spoke this way, Rama self-collectedly made a headway for the search of Seetha along with Soumitri. [3-61-19]"
3-61-16,"Those two sons of Dasharatha have started a thorough search for Seetha in forests, on mountains, also thus at rivers and lakes. [3-61-20]"
3-61-17,"On searching whole of mountainsides of that Mt. Chitrakuta, where their hermitage is there, even in its caves, crags, and mountain peaks they have not found Seetha. [3-61-21]"
3-61-18,"On exploring everywhere on that mountain Rama said to Lakshmana, oh, Soumitri, here on this mountain I do not descry auspicious Vaidehi. [3-61-22]"
3-61-19,"While roving searchingly in Dandaka forest Lakshmana who is tormented by anguish said a sentence to his greatly resplendent brother Rama. [3-61-23]"
3-61-20,"Oh, insightful brother, you will reacquire Janaka&#39;s daughter Maithili, as Vishnu once subjugated Emperor Bali and reacquired this earth. [3-61-24]"
3-61-21,"But when the valiant Lakshmana addressed him in that way, Raghava whose thinking is marred by poignance spoke these pathetic words. [3-61-25]"
3-61-22,"This forest in its entirety, these lotus-lakes with their blossomed lotuses, and this mountain with its many caves and mountain-rapids, all are evidently searched. But, oh, sensible brother, I do not descry Vaidehi who is loftier than my lives. [3-61-27]"
3-61-23,"Lamenting in this way Rama languished owing to the abduction of Seetha and became a pitiable one, and while sadness besieging him he is perturbed for a moment. [3-61-28]"
3-61-24,"All the limbs of Rama are fluttered, his faculty has become functionless, his fervour is frozen, he is forlorn and flustered, and such as he is he sank down suspiring swelteringly and lengthily. [3-61-29]"
3-61-25,"Suspiring repeatedly he that lotus-eyed Rama shrieked repeatedly and loudly thus as, &#39;ha, Seetha...&#39; with tears stifling his throat. [3-61-30]"
3-61-26,"Though Rama has many kinsfolk who hold him dear he is now left with a single one, namely Lakshmana, and that obedient brother Lakshmana who is already anguished for Rama&#39;s sadness, then adjoining his palms obediently started to pacify Rama with divers methods. [3-61-31]"
3-61-27,"But disavowing the word of advice that fell out from the cupped lips of Lakshmana, Rama stridently yelled again and again when his dear Seetha has become unseeable. [3-61-32]"
3-62-1,"In not seeing Seetha that virtue-souled Rama's sagacity is marred by his anguish andhe bewailed with his lotus-like eyes that are reddening like a pair of lotuses, raising is longarms. [3-62-1]"
3-62-2,"Even if Raghava is not able to see Seetha in his presence he started talking to herin a kind of inarticulate wailing, as wailing pampered his articulacy because his speech tookshelter of wailing instinct, and as he is cowed down by Love-god, and thus he started to vent outhis heart in this way. [3-62-2]"
3-62-3,"Flowers fascinate you very much, my dear, hence you veil yourself with the fullbloomed branches of Ashoka tree, but that alone is amplifying my anguish because you both havepresently became tormentors. [3-62-3]"
3-62-4,"Maybe, both your thighs liken to the stalks of banana plants, thinking so, now youhave lapped them in grovy banana plants, but I can distinguish which is which, thus now I caughtsight of them, oh, lady, you are inapt at least to cover them from me. [3-62-4]"
3-62-5,"Oh, lady, you are facetiously glorying in the boscage of fully bloomed Karnikaaratrees which is really wafting worry to me, rather than the fragrance of those flowers oh, gloriouslady, enough, enough is this facetiousness of yours. [3-62-5]"
3-62-6,"I am aware of your humour, lady, and I know that you are jocose, but in a placelike hermitage unmerited is this sort of raillery, even if it is good-natured. Hence, you comeback, oh, wide-eyed one, your cottage is empty. [3-62-6, 7a]"
3-62-7,"Oh, Lakshmana, very evidently demons have either gorged up Seetha, or perhapsabducted her, because she is not returning to me who am whiny indeed for her. [3-62-7b, 8a]"
3-62-8,"Indeed these teary-eyed mobs of deer look as if to explain that nightwalkers havegluttonised my lady. [3-62-8b, 9a]"
3-62-9,"Ha! My graceful lady, to where you have strayed now... Ha! Chastely and bestcomplexioned lady, now the ambition of my queen mother Kaikeyi will be fulfilled, as I breath mylast owing to your straying... [3-62-8b, 9a]"
3-62-10,"I have come to forests with Seetha and have to go back to Ayodhya without Seetha.How, in all but name, can I step into an oblivion called my palace-chambers? [3-62-9b, 10a]"
3-62-11,"People will denounce me as a vigourless and pitiless person, and my ineptitude willindeed be self-evident, for Seetha is led away from me by some tactical being... [3-62-10b,11a]"
3-62-12,"When the king of Mithila Janaka asks after the wellbeing of all the three of usafter the completion of forest living, how do I have the face to stand him? [3-62-11b, 12a]"
3-62-13,"On seeing me without Seetha the king of Videha will be distraught by the perishingof his daughter, and he defiantly goes under the preponderance of perplexity... [3-62-12b, 13a]"
3-62-14,"Instead, I prefer not to go to the city Ayodhya that is ruled by Bharata, becauseit must be comforting to one and all under his rulership, but not to me as Seetha will not be withme... else if, that end of my life occurs now and if I were to go to heaven, even that heaven willbe a void to me without her... I believe so... [3-62-13b, 14a]"
3-62-15,"Hence, Lakshmana, you go back to that auspicious city Ayodhya forsaking me inforests, because I have no existence without Seetha, isn't it! [3-62-14b, 15a]"
3-62-16,"On tightly hugging Bharata you shall tell him these words as I have said, 'Ramaauthorises you to reign the earth...' [3-62-16]"
3-62-17,"Oh, efficacious Lakshmana, on revering my mothers Kaika, Sumitra, and Kausalyajustifiably you tell them my good bye, and you as the one who effectuates whatever is assigned toyou, you have to effortfully protect my mother Kausalya by doing whatever she says. [3-62-17b,18]"
3-62-18,"Oh, the subjugator of unfriendly, Lakshmana... you shall clearly inform in detailabout this perish of Seetha, also that of mine, to our mothers. [3-62-19]"
3-62-19,"Thus Raghava, the dejected, neared every corner of the forest in his search, andbewailed because that lady with best plaits, Seetha, is not found and missing from him. EvenLakshmana became whey-faced, frantic-hearted, highly overwrought, by the fear of uncertaintylooming large on them. [3-62-20]"
3-63-1,"That prince Rama whom agony and anguish are distressing has become anxious in his mien, and he again drifted into a dire desperation while despairing his brother Lakshmana. [3-63-1]"
3-63-2,"Rama who is sunken in a chasmal sorrow spoke this sentence while wailing sorrowfully, suspiring severely and scorchingly, and which sentence is seemly to his sensitivity, to Lakshmana who is already under the sway of sorrow. [3-63-2]"
3-63-3,"I am second to none among the blameworthy wrongdoers on this earth, thus I deem, and indeed woe followed by woe are getting at me in seriation to burst my heart and mind... [3-63-3]"
3-63-4,"I might have definitely, habitually, and desirably committed damnable deeds in my previous births, and now the result of those impious deeds is very much ripened and has fallen on me, whereby I am entering misery after misery... [3-63-4]"
3-63-5,"I am deprived of the kingdom, departed from my own people, mainly Seetha, my father departed and I am detached from my mother, and Lakshmana, when all these setbacks are very deeply thought over they are replenishing the haste of my agony... [3-63-5]"
3-63-6,"All this sadness of mine has silenced physically and there is some peace on coming to these desolate forests, in association of Seetha, but with the dissociation of Seetha misery is again upshot, as with fire which flares up in a flash when fuel is added... [3-63-6]"
3-63-7,"My noblewoman might be abducted by a demon, and on reaching the sky that lady who converses with a sweet voice might have wept a lot fearfully, and it is definite that she must have shouted a lot, untunefully... [3-63-7]"
3-63-8,"Those two roundish bosoms of my ladylove which always deserved the application of pleasantly looking red-sandalwood&#39;s paste might definitely be unshiny, as they might be bedaubed with muddy blood when they are extricated from her body for devouring. [3-63-8]"
3-63-9,"She has a sweet, softish, and very clear talkativeness on her lips. That visage with such lips is crowned with a hairdo with hair lumped together and plaited, such as her visage is, it must have become unshiny on her going into the repression of demon, as with an unshiny moon when repressed in the mouth of eclipsing planet Raahu, it is definite... [3-63-9]"
3-63-10,"The contours of the neck of that strait-laced ladylove of mine are always worthy for necklaces and chain-wears. The bloodthirsty demons would have indeed mangled that neck in a secluded place and they might have drunk her blood, it is definite... [3-63-10]"
3-63-11,"While I was away from her in this uninhibited forest demons would have forcibly hauled her up when they are abducting that lady with broad-bright eyes, and she would have discordantly shrieked out like a piteous she-dove, it is definite... [3-63-11]"
3-63-12,"Sitting very close to me on this stone&#39;s surface, oh, Lakshmana, she that well-mannered Seetha with bright smiles was speaking to you verbosely with all smiles... [3-63-12]"
3-63-13,"Among rivers this Godavari is the best and it is an all the time cherished river to my ladylove, and I think she would have gone thereunto. But, at anytime she did not go there, singly... [3-63-13]"
3-63-14,"Or, that lotus-faced, lotus-petal eyed Seetha has gone straight to bring lotuses! Nay, that idea itself is incongruous, for she never goes to get lotuses, indeed without me... [3-63-14]"
3-63-15,"But has she really gone to this stand of thicket which is with flowered trees and with birds of divers kind! Nay, that thought also is incongruent, because she as a timid one is much scared of solitude... [3-63-15]"
3-63-16,"Oh, Sun, you are the knower of performed and unperformed deeds in the world, a wittnesser of good and bad deeds in the world, tell me, who am woefully writhing, to where my ladylove strolled, or is she stolen... [3-63-16]"
3-63-17,"Oh, Air, whatsoever is there in the world, wheresoever it might be, or whensoever it might have happened, and whichsoever it might be, and whencesoever it might exist, that cannot possibly be unknown to you. Hence, tell me of the lady from noble heritage... is she stolen, or slain, or strayed her steps... Thus Rama begged of the Eternals for locating Seetha. [3-63-17]"
3-63-18,"To such a Rama whose physique is routed by his anguish in this way and who is insensately bewailing in that way, Soumitri whose courage is un-dispirited gave a justifiable and timely suggestion. [3-63-18]"
3-63-19,"Oh, noble brother, banish that anguish and brace yourself with fortitude, and let you be with spiritedness in her searching... indeed, there is no backsliding for spirited men in their enterprises in this world, even though the enterprises are highly impracticable... [3-63-19]"
3-63-20,"When Soumitri of towering bravery is speaking this way, Rama, the enhancer of Raghu&#39;s lineage, gave no heed to it, and since he castaway his fortitude he again encountered an inexplicable anguish. [3-63-20]"
3-64-1,"A pitiable one, such as he is, he spoke to Lakshmana in a pitiable voice,""Lakshmana, go quickly to River Godavari and find out whether Seetha has gone to Godavari to fetchlotuses..."" [3-64-1, 2a]"
3-64-2,"When Rama said thus to him Lakshmana again went to the charming River Godavariquickening his pace. [3-64-2b, 3a]"
3-64-3,"Searching at many declivities which River Godavari has on its banks Lakshmana saidto Rama, ""I do not espy her at ghats, declivities of riverbanks, and she is not replying though Ishouted for her. [3-64-3b, 4a]"
3-64-4,"In fact, oh, Rama, to which place she that neutraliser of nervousness, namelyVaidehi, has got round to, or where that frailty is, that place is really incomprehensible to me...[3-64-4b, 5a]"
3-64-5,"Rama who is already stupefied by anguish is now despaired on listening Lakshmana'swords and he personally went straight to River Godavari, and staying nearby that river Rama shoutedin this way, ""Seetha... where are you?"" [3-64-5b, 6]"
3-64-6,"The forest creatures which were asked earlier have not said to Rama that adeservedly destructible demagogue of demons has divested him of Seetha, likewise now River Godavariwhich is now being asked has not informed Rama about Seetha. [3-64-7]"
3-64-7,"Though the woeful Rama has asked her, and even though all the georgic beingsimpelled her to inform Rama the fact about his ladylove, River Godavari then remained mouthlessabout Seetha. [3-64-8]"
3-64-8,"She that River Godavari has not informed Rama about Vaidehi just out of fear onrecalling the mien and manoeuvres of malefic-minded Ravana, lest Ravana may drain her away.[3-64-9]"
3-64-9,"Rama who is already in a rundown condition owing to the non-appearance of Seetha, isfurther rendered as a hopeless being by River Godavari in the matter of his catching a glimpse ofSeetha, and such a Rama spoke to Saumitri. [3-64-10]"
3-64-10,"Oh, kind Lakshmana, this Godavari is talking to me anything but a reply. In theabsence of Vaidehi, oh Lakshmana, really what is that unpleasant word I have to say to Vaidehi'sfather king Janaka, also thus to Vaidehi's mother-in-law and my mother Kausalya, when I meet them![3-64-11, 12a]"
3-64-11,"Which Vaidehi is the remover of all my sadness who am a destitute of kingdom andsurviving in forests on forest produce, such as she is, where has she gone, really! [3-64-12b,13a]"
3-64-12,"Though I am distanced from my relatives I deemed that princess Seetha alone wouldbe an evermore relative of mine. But now when that princess alone is unseen I deem that mysleepless nights would be lengthy. [3-64-13b, 14a]"
3-64-13,"I will search all these places of Godavari, Janasthaana and this mountain with manyrapids, perhaps Seetha may be available somewhere. [3-64-14b, 15a]"
3-64-14,"Now all these burly animals are repeatedly looking at me as though to speak to me,oh, brave Lakshmana, this I reckon with their body language as it were. [3-64-15b, 16a]"
3-64-15,"But on seeing them pryingly that tigerly-man Raghava has indeed asked them at oncewith a voice stifled with tears, ""where is Seetha?"" [3-64-16b, 17a]"
3-64-16,"When that best king has asked, those animals rose to their feet in a trice andfacing themselves southward showed skyward with their snouts. And while running in the direction inwhich Maithili is taken away they are stopping to look back at that lord of people, Rama. Thus theyare repeatedly running, stopping and staring at Rama. [3-64-17b, 18, 19a]"
3-64-17,"By which reason those animals are going in a southerly course on a southerlyterrain, and stopping to peer at Rama, and again clamorously adopting the very same southerlycourse, Lakshmana ascertained that reason. [3-64-19b, 20a]"
3-64-18,"On noticing the lingua franca and even the lingua persona of those animals, thatimaginative Lakshmana spoke to his elder brother, alike a striver striving hard for someinformation. [3-64-20b, 21a]"
3-64-19,"Oh, godly brother, when you have asked these animals, 'where is Seetha,' theyquickly rose to their feet, and as to how they are showing the track on the ground and the southerndirection as well, thereby we may, for sure, go south-westward to know whether there is someinformation about her, or else, even that noble lady herself may be available there... [3-64-21a,22, 23a]"
3-64-20,"On saying ""Yes!"" to Lakshmana that illustrious Rama of Kakutstha sallied forth tosouthern direction followed by Lakshmana, scrutinising the earth on his walkway. [3-64-23b,24a]"
3-64-21,"Those two brothers who are proceeding while discussing among themselves have seenthe walkway bestrewn with flowers fallen from a person. [3-64-24b, 25a]"
3-64-22,"That valiant Rama who is anguished to see the drizzle of flowers fallen on thesurface of earth spoke this word to Lakshmana who is equally anguished. [3-64-25b, 26a]"
3-64-23,"I recognise these flowers that are fallen here, oh, Lakshmana. In forest I gavethem to Vaidehi and she tucked these very flowers in her bun. [3-64-26b, 27a]"
3-64-24,"These flowers are carefully safeguarded by the sun, as they are unwithered yet, byair as they are unswept by it, and by the glorious earth, as they are unspoilt by that, thus I deemthat these naturals, sun, air, and earth are really proffering a helping hand to me. [3-64-27b,28a]"
3-64-25,"On saying thus to best one among men Lakshmana, that virtue-souled and dextrous Ramaasked the mountain that is uproarious with rapids. [3-64-28b, 29a]"
3-64-26,"Oh, lord among the earth-bolstered mountains, have you somehow seen a beauty by allher limbs, foregone by me in beautiful woodlands? [3-64-29b, 30a]"
3-64-27,"<font color=""#B3003A"">Reply of mountain to Rama:</font>""Oh, lordly bolsterer ofearth, lord Rama, I have somehow seen a beauty by all her limbs, foregone by you in beautifulwoodlands.'"
3-64-28,"Because his question is unanswered he is enraged as with a lion enraging at a punyanimal, and then he spoke to the mountain, ""show me that golden tinged, golden limbed Seetha, oh,mountain, no sooner than I devastate all your apices, apiece..."" [3-64-30b, 31]"
3-64-29,"When Rama spoke to the mountain in this way, that mountain echoed as if it isrevealing Seetha, but actually it has not revealed Seetha to Raghava. [3-64-32]"
3-64-30,"Then Rama of Dasharatha said to the hefty mountain, ""When the infernos of my arrowswill burn you down completely and when you will be pared down ashes, you shall be grassless,treeless and tender-leafless, and thus you become a meritless mountain... hence, show Seetha beforebecoming so... [3-64-33, 34a]"
3-64-31,"Lakshmana, if this River Godavari is not going to tell me immediately about thatmoonshine-faced Seetha, now I will dry her up... [3-64-34b, 35a]"
3-64-32,"This way when Rama is highly infuriated and who appeared to burn down anything justwith his eyes, then he has seen on the ground gigantic footprints of a demon, and the footprints ofVaidehi, who appeared to have run fearfully here and there in a helter-skelter manner expecting thearrival of Rama, and which footprints are heavily trodden by a demon who followed her. [3-64-35b,36, 37a]"
3-64-33,"On scrutinising the overly trodden footprints of Seetha and the demon, and a brokenbow, broken quiver, and broken and variously bestrewn chariot also, then Rama became baffle-heartedand said to his dear brother Lakshmana. [3-64-37b, 38]"
3-64-34,"See Lakshmana, many beads of jewellery and many bits of garlands of Vaidehi haveindeed fallen down, and oh, Soumitri, they are strewn around... [3-64-39]"
3-64-35,"Also the surface of the earth is everywhere interspersed with big and small blooddrops that are akin to golden droplets, you see them Saumitri... [3-64-40]"
3-64-36,"I think Lakshmana, guise changing demons would have ripped and rived Vaidehi, ordivided her into pieces, or they might have gluttonised her. [3-64-41]"
3-64-37,"A deadly clash has occurred here, Soumitri, while two demons were clashing betweenthemselves on account of Vaidehi... [3-64-42]"
3-64-38,"Oh, gentle Lakshmana, studded with pearls and gems this great bow of someone isbeautifully decorated, but it is fragmented and fallen to earth. Oh, dear boy, Lakshmana, this bowmay perhaps belong to demons, or else to gods... [3-64-43, 44a]"
3-64-39,"Studded with lapis gem beads this golden armour of someone is similar to the risingsun in its shine, but it is splintered and fallen to earth... [3-64-44b, 45a]"
3-64-40,"This hundred-spoked regal-parasol of someone is embellished with divine festoons,but oh, gentle Lakshmana, its central-shaft is wrecked and it is felled to earth... [3-64-45b,46a]"
3-64-41,"These ghost-faced mules with golden breastplates are macabre in form and massive inframe, but they are hewed down in war, whose are they, either... [3-64-46b, 47a]"
3-64-42,"Somebody's combat-chariot is irradiant and similar in shine to the flaring firewith a war-pennon, but it is broken and battered down, as well... [3-64-47b, 48a]"
3-64-43,"These frightful looking arrows of somebody are gilded and they are as much as achariot's axle in their thickness, but their arrowheads are shred and they are manifoldly shreddedand strewn around... [3-64-48, 49a]"
3-64-44,"Lakshmana, you see these two quivers packed with arrows are completely shattered,and the charioteer is drop dead with whip and bridles still in his hands... whose charioteer hemight be! [3-64-49b, 50a]"
3-64-45,"Lakshmana, you see... these two armours, one belonging to the combatant from thischariot [that is ripped off by Jataayu and fallen from the body of Ravana,] and the other belongingto this charioteer, both are encrusted fully with arrows [when Jataayu winnowed the very samearrows shot by Ravana with both of his wings and thus shot them back,] thus the two armours arecompletely shattered... and the charioteer is drop dead with whip and bridles in his hand... eitherhe... whose is he... and where is the presiding combatant of this chariot...."
3-64-46,"Evidently this is the modus operandi of someone who is a male demon, and you seehow my animosity has become hundredfold to eradicate them... [3-64-50b, 51a]"
3-64-47,"The highly stony-hearted demons that are guise-changers by their wish have eitherabducted, or killed or gluttonised saintly Seetha... but, they say that rectitude saves suchsaintly persons... yet that rectitude has not saved Seetha while she is being abducted in greatforest... [3-64-51b, 52]"
3-64-48,"Whether Vaidehi is taken away or taken in by some unknown being, oh, gentleLakshmana, then who are the gods who can possibly be benignant to me in this world... [3-64-53]"
3-64-49,"Lakshmana, someone, even if He were a Creator of Worlds, or an Omnipotent, if Hewere to be lenient at heart or in His actions, He will be disrespected by all beings, owing to theunenlightenment of those beings... [3-64-54]"
3-64-50,"I who am mellowly, magnanimous, merciful and yoked only to the wellbeing of allworlds, such as I am, all of the heavenly gods deem me as non-Omnipotent... it is definite...[3-64-55]"
3-64-51,"Have you seen Lakshmana how merits like mercifulness, magnanimity and the like areinverted to become demerits on getting at me, thus I am unmerited in forgoing Seetha. As such, aswith the sizzle of sun uprisen quelling all the moonshine, now you may see as to how my irradianceradiates quelling all the merits like softness and fairness for the nonentity of all beingsproactive to demons, inclusive of demons. [3-64-56, 57]"
3-64-52,"Oh, Lakshmana, will the yaksha-s be comfortable now, no; gandharva-s - no; monsters- no; demons - no; either kinnaraa-s or humans - no, none can be comfortable henceforth...[3-64-58]"
3-64-53,"Now the welkin will be packed with my arrows and missiles, and I will render it asan impassable sphere for the treaders in the triad of worlds... [3-64-59]"
3-64-54,"I will make the triad of worlds quiescent by completely blockading all theplanetary bodies. The night-maker moon will be barricaded, aurae of fire, air and sun will bedevastated, and then everything will be overcast with darkness. Mountaintops will be completelypulverised, water receptacles will be dried out, and trees, creeping-plants and shrubberies will bedestroyed, and oceans depleted, thus I will bring the triad of the worlds to nought, relative tothe task of Time in extinguishing an era... [3-64-60, 61, 62a]"
3-64-55,"If the gods are not going to safely restore Seetha to me, oh, Soumitri, they cansee what my blitzkrieg is, at this very moment... [3-64-62b, 63a]"
3-64-56,"All beings cannot fly high in the sky, oh, Lakshmana, as there will be a labyrinthof my arrows released from my bowstring, minus an intercolumniation... [3-64-63b, 64a]"
3-64-57,"Bombarded with my iron-shafts this world will be put to disorderliness, Lakshmana,you may now witness how the animals and birds will be dazed and devastated... [3-64-64b, 65a]"
3-64-58,"Because of Maithili I will render this mortal world de-demonical, de-phantasmal byforce-stretching my unstoppable arrows up to my ears to release them forcefully... [3-64-65b,66a]"
3-64-59,"Let the gods witness now the impact of the blaze-crested, thoroughgoing arrows ofmine, projected by my wrath and released by my irascibility... [3-64-66b, 67a]"
3-64-60,"That being so, when the triad of worlds is completely ruined by my anger will therebe gods, no; demons - no; phantoms - no, none can survive... [3-64-67b, 68a]"
3-64-61,"Whatever worlds of gods, or monsters, or even those of demons are there, they willbe splintered and falling down apiece by the fusillades of my arrows... [3-64-68b, 69a]"
3-64-62,"Whether she is abducted, or even if she is killed, oh, Soumitri, if the gods arenot going to give back my Seetha I will now jeopardise these worlds with my arrows... [3-64-69b,70a]"
3-64-63,"If my ladylove is not returned indeed in a fine fettle as she was before my runningafter Golden Deer, I will be annihilating the triad of world in its entirety, together with itsmobile and sessile beings, and I will be sweltering the entire universe with my arrows as long as Iam not going to get a glimpse of her. Thus Rama gave a vent to his feelings. [3-64-70b, 71a]"
3-64-64,"Rama on saying thus with his eyes reddening in fury, his lappet-fold of lips jerkingspasmodically, he girded up his jute-cloths and deerskin and twined up the mass of his matted-hair.[3-64-72]"
3-64-65,"When the disposition of that venturesome and infuriated Rama has become in that wayholocaustic, it is like that of Rudra, the All-Inflamer god, when He became like this in earliertimes, intending to inflame the Triple-Cities. [3-64-73]"
3-64-66,"On saying so that illustrious Rama, the delighter of world, grabbed his bow fromLakshmana and gripped it tightly, unholstered a deadly and dazzling arrow from his quiver which islike a poisonous serpent, and readying it on the bowstring of his bow, that Rama, the vanquisher ofenemies fastnesses, who looked like the Ear-End-Fire, spoke this sentence. [3-64-74, 75]"
3-64-67,"As to how all the created beings cannot counteract the ageing, dying, fate and theTime at anytime, likewise I too am non-countervailed, when I am coalesced with fury, no doubt aboutit... [3-64-76]"
3-64-68,"If that princess of Mithila, who has suavely and toothy smiles and who causesirreproachability to my character if only I can have a glimpse of her, is not returned to me infine fettle as she was when she was with me, then I will countermove whole of this universetogether with its gods, immortals, humans, florae and faunas, mountains and waters... andwhatnot... [3-64-77]"
3-65-1,"Lakshmana on seeing Rama who is searing and careworn owing to the abduction ofSeetha, blazing like the doomsday inferno, twinned with the notion of rendering the worlds intononentity, kenning at his stringed bow, keen to blaze away entire universe, suspiring again andagain, and who is alike Rudra at the end of era, and whose highly infuriated persona Lakshmana hasnot seen previously, became pale-faced and spoke to Rama with folded palms. [3-65-1]"
3-65-2,"Previously, you were self-collected and self-controlled and delighted in thewellbeing of all the beings. But presently, slipping into fury you are discarding your owndisposition, which is unapt of you... [3-65-4]"
3-65-3,"Grandeur in moon, splendour in sun, motion in wind, and composure in earth areperpetual and all this perpetuity is available in you, besides an unexcelled honour... [3-65-5]"
3-65-4,"It will be unapt of you to vandalise worlds for a single-soul's felony. It isunclear as to whose combat-chariot is this, or by whom, or by what reason it is shattered with itsweaponry and paraphernalia... [3-65-6, 7a]"
3-65-5,"This has become a very ghastly place since it is grooved by the hooves of ungulatesand by the felloies of chariot-wheels, and it is wetted with drops of blood, oh, prince, thereby acombat is fought and stalled at this place... [3-65-7b, 8a]"
3-65-6,"This is just a solo-combatant's combat but not among duo, oh, best articulator oneamong best articulators, I indeed observe that no huge army is eventuated here, nor its stamp...[3-65-8b, 9a]"
3-65-7,"It will be inapt of you to wish for wrecking a havoc upon all worlds for anindividual's wrongdoing. Why because, the good-hearted, good-natured kings are they who imposetenable punishment... [3-65-9b, 10a]"
3-65-8,"You are always the shelterer for all beings, for you're above all the good-naturedand good-hearted ordinary kings, and who can really deem the ravagement of you wife as an act ofgrace... [3-65-10b, 11a]"
3-65-9,"As no altruist can evoke indignation in a hallowed person who is performingVedic-ritual, honestly, these rivers, oceans, mountains, gods, celestials, and cacodemons toocannot evoke indignation in you, because they are always gentle to you... isn't so... [3-65-10b,11a]"
3-65-10,"Oh, king, it will be apt of you to wield your bow and search for him who abductedSeetha, along with me as your squire and standby, and with the help of sublime sages available inthis forest... [3-65-12b, 13a]"
3-65-11,"Let us search the oceans, rivers and forests, and even divers dreadful caves anddifferent lotus-lakes... [3-65-13b, 14a]"
3-65-12,"Let us intently search the worlds of gods and celestials as long as the abductor ofyour wife is unapprehended... [3-65-14b, 15a]"
3-65-13,"Oh, Lord of Kosala kingdom, if the heavenly lords are not going bestow your wifepropitiously, rather after our humanly effort, then you may do whatever you want, seasonably...[3-65-15b, c]"
3-65-14,"If, oh, king, you with your traits of sincerity, solidarity, simplicity, andscrupulosity are not going to get back Seetha, then you may you may put whole of the universe toturmoil with the torrents of your arrows which have swift egress as they are with golden-handleswhich are stuffed with eagle feathers, and which mirror up the Thunderbolts of Mahendra in theirtrajectories... Thus Lakshmana appealed to ireful Rama. [3-65-16]"
3-66-1,"While Rama is bewailing like a forlorn as his anguish is scorching him, renderedimpoverished with an inanimate heart as a high passion possessed him, Lakshmana, the son ofSumitra, suppliantly gripped his feet and started to address him. [4-66-1, 2]"
3-66-2,"Oh, Rama, as gods have reaped ambrosia after a prolonged churning of Milky Ocean,you are a reap of King Dasharatha's superlative ascesis and even by his superior acts...[4-66-3]"
3-66-3,"Our father was an enlivener of all the subjects and that king was beholden only toyour rosy endowments, but he obtained godhood by your separation... this is what we heard fromBharata... [4-66-4]"
3-66-4,"If you are unable to withstand this anguish chanced on you, oh, Kakutstha, then howa simpleton and whose boldness is meagre can withstand it... [4-66-5]"
3-66-5,"Oh, first and foremost man, tell me who is uncaught by mischance, which mischancewill be catchy like fire-catch, and oh, king, even that, that lets up momently... [4-66-6]"
3-66-6,"If you are going to blaze away worlds with your radiance in your ruefulness, towhere the ordinary people in rue shall go for solace, really... [4-66-7]"
3-66-7,"World's disposition is this way only, even if Nahusha, the son Yayaati, has becomean egalitarian with Indra, writhe touched him off... [4-66-8]"
3-66-8,"Which great sage Vashishta is there, who is also the priest of our father, heparented a hundred sons in one day and like that they are all eliminated in one day by Vishvamitra,for which Vashishta also lamented, but not for a long... [4-66-9]"
3-66-9,"This Mother Earth who is the mother of worlds and venerated by all animate andinanimate, or even celestial beings, oh, king of Kosala kingdom, even she undergoes tremors andearthquakes... [4-66-10]"
3-66-10,"Which duteous pair is the pair of eyes of the world in whom all the systems ofworld are peremptory, though that pair of Sun and Moon are doughtily influential in this solarsystem, eclipse draws nigh of them... [4-66-11]"
3-66-11,"Even very great incorporates like earth and suchlike planets, oh, bullish man, oreven the gods, or even all corporeal beings, cannot get release from the predestine of SupremeBeing... [4-66-12]"
3-66-12,"Oh, tigerly-man, we hear that whether gods like Indra et al., are ethical and/orunethical, yet they too have the resultant agonies and ecstasies... hence, it is inapt of you tofret thyself... [4-66-13]"
3-66-13,"Whether Vaidehi is stolen or slain, oh, brave one, it will be inapt of you saddenlike this as with any other commoner without tracking her whereabouts... [4-66-14]"
3-66-14,"Persons of your like who are always equable in their outlook, oh, Rama, they willremain non-dispirited even if they are undergoing desperate straits, and they will not just saddenlike this... [4-66-15]"
3-66-15,"Oh, foremost man among men, you ratiocinate in subtle pursuit, objectively andbrainily, and great brains will comprehend good and bad in subtlety with their braininess...[4-66-16]"
3-66-16,"Indiscernible are the rights and wrongs of actions, and indefinite are thecherished fruits of those actions, and without performing any action, fruits also will benonexistent... [4-66-17]"
3-66-17,"The great brains with their braininess are clearly comprehending the indiscernible,indefinite or infirm rights and wrongs of their actions, thus they translate their thinking intoaction... and thus they are undertaking humanly possible action... but not sitting back, unlikeyou..."
3-66-18,"Oh, brave one, to those that are interested in endeavours, whether or not they areuninterested in the results of their actions, either rights or wrongs, but even to them cherishedfruits does not occur, effortlessly..."
3-66-19,"Oh valiant one, indeed you alone have said this way to me previously andrepeatedly, who really can profess you even he were to be professedly the Jupiter... [4-66-18]"
3-66-20,"Oh, great discerner, your thinking process is non-explicatory even to gods, but nowthat thinking process is obliquely and utterly slumberous owing to your sadness, hence I amaddressing your percipience and this is no schoolteaching... [4-66-19]"
3-66-21,"Oh, foremost one among Ikshvaku, oh, Rama, contemplate the divineness of thoseimmortals and their pure being in maintaining world order, also consider the humanness of thesemortals and their helpless susceptibility to pain, also count on your own valour that which canannihilate the whole of anything... and then come to conclusion whether or not to annihilateeverything... but, before that try hard to eliminate the abuser, lest he may abuse many others...[4-66-20]"
3-66-22,"Oh, best one among Ikshvaku-s, oh, Rama, contemplate the divine valour you havederived, also consider the human valour you have inherited, also count on your own innate valour...hence, try hard to eliminate the abuser..."
3-66-23,"Oh, best one among men, what is it you gain on performing a complete annihilationowing to a single soul's malefaction, hence, mark him... that malefactor and a malevolent of yours,and it will be apt of you to uproot him... him alone... [4-66-21]"
3-67-1,"Even though Rama is elder to Lakshmana he gleaned the ultimate tenor of Lakshmana'swords when Lakshmana just said them expediently because Raghava is a best gleaner of the gist ofadvises. [3-67-1]"
3-67-2,"Such as he is that dextrous Rama on controlling his highly heightening fury,propping against his bedazzling bow spoke this to Lakshmana. [3-67-2]"
3-67-3,"What is to be done by us, oh, dear boy... or, whereto we might go, or, by whichdevice Seetha is discernable... Lakshmana, now you think of it, clearly... [3-67-3]"
3-67-4,"To such a Rama who is tormented by anguish, Lakshmana said, ""it will be apt of youto search this Janasthaana alone which is rife with many demons, and replete with manifold treesand climber-plants... [3-67-4]"
3-67-5,"Here there are unclimbable mountains, glens and glyphs as well. There are diversand pernicious caverns tumultuous with diverse packs of predators, and here are the mansions ofkinnaraa-s and palaces of gandharva-s, as well... [3-67-5b, 6]"
3-67-6,"It will be apt of you to steadfastly search in them along with me, and oh, best oneamong men, your sort of literati and clever-souls will be unfluctuating in calamities like themountains unfluctuating in windstorms... Lakshmana said so Rama. [3-67-6, 7, 8a]"
3-67-7,"When Lakshmana said in this way to that ireful Rama, he roved entire forest alongwith Lakshmana readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on his bow. [3-67-8b, 9a]"
3-67-8,"Then Rama beheld Jataayu who is akin to a mountaintop in his gleam, and a bestbeatific brave bird among all the birds, but bloodstained and buckling on earth. [3-67-9b, 10a]"
3-67-9,"On beholding him who is like a mountaintop in his gleam, Rama said to Lakshmana,""This one has gluttonised Seetha, the princess from Vaidehi, there is no doubt about it...[3-67-10b, 11a]"
3-67-10,"It is apparent that this demon skulks in the forest in the semblance of an eagle,and having gluttonised that wide-eyed Seetha he is now reposing comfortably. I will eliminate himwith deadly arrows, whose arrowheads blaze away and which shoot off straightly... Thus Ramadeclared. [3-67-11b, 12]"
3-67-11,"On saying thus and on readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on hisbow, that ireful Rama rushed towards the eagle, as though to a-tremble the whole of the earth thatwhich is within the perimeter of oceans. [3-67-13]"
3-67-12,"But that bird spewing up frothy blood pathetically appealed to such an ireful son ofDasharatha, namely Rama, in a pathetic tone. [3-67-14]"
3-67-13,"Oh, boy Rama, blest is your eternality, for whom you are searching as with thesearch of a rejuvenescent herb in the vast of forest, Ravana stole that lady and my lives, too...[3-67-15]"
3-67-14,"I have seen that lady while being stolen by brute-forced Ravana when you and evenLakshmana absented from her... [3-67-16]"
3-67-15,"I outreached to rescue Seetha... and in a combat Ravana is rendered as one withutterly battered chariot... and I felled him and that chariot there... onto earth's surface...[3-67-17]"
3-67-16,"This one is his fragmented bow and this is his fragmented armour... oh, Rama, thisis his combat-chariot... which, in combat shattered by me... [3-67-18]"
3-67-17,"This is his charioteer drop dead onto earth by my wings... when I am overtiredRavana gashed my wings and flew skyward taking Seetha of Videha kingdom with him, and it will beinapt of you to kill me who am already killed by the demon... Thus Jataayu appealed to Rama.[3-67-19, 20]"
3-67-18,"Rama jettisoned his forceful bow when he heard the much desired news about Seethawhile hugging that kingly eagle Jataayu. [3-67-21]"
3-67-19,"Even though Rama is comparatively a bold person he involuntarily fell down toground, as the onefold scorch of anguish for Seetha is doubled by this predicament of Jataayu, andhe wept over Jataayu. [3-67-22]"
3-67-20,"Jataayu is supine on a single-strait passable for a single-person and he issuspiring for several times, and on seeing such Jataayu Rama became anguished and spoke this toSoumitri. [3-67-23]"
3-67-21,"Mislaid is my kingdom and I am mislocated into forests, Seetha is misplaced and nowthis mischance of death on this bird... this kind of misfortune of mine incinerates even Agni, theDivine-Incinerator... [3-67-24]"
3-67-22,"Even if it were to be a plethoric and limitless ocean, and now if I were to enterit, or take a swim to the other shore of blissfulness, even that Lord of Rivers runs completelydry, owing to my misfortune, it is definite... [3-67-25]"
3-67-23,"There will not be any greater unfortunate being in this world than me, even if allthe sessile and mobile beings are put together, by whom such a complicated catastrophic enmeshmentas this is derived... [3-67-26]"
3-67-24,"This decrepit kingly eagle is the friend of my father who is terminally gashed andrecumbent on the floor owing only to the backlash of my fortune... So lamented Rama for thewounded eagle Jataayu. [3-67-27]"
3-67-25,"Thus, lamenting in that way for many times Raghava patted the body of Jataayu alongwith Lakshmana instancing his parental regard. [3-67-28]"
3-67-26,"On hugging that kingly eagle whose wings are hacked off and who is bloodstained, andon uttering this much, ""she who is identical with my lives,... where is that Maithili..."" Ramacollapsed to earth. [3-67-29]"
3-68-1,"Rama on seeing that eagle felled to ground by the atrocious Ravana, said this sentence to Soumitri who is an asset for good companionability. [3-68-1]"
3-68-2,"While this bird is venturing in my concern the demon felled him in combat and he is leaving off his lives owing to me, definitely... [3-68-2]"
3-68-3,"Obviously, lives in his body are very feeble, oh, Lakshmana, it is natural, isn&#39;t it, and he looks highly anguished with a dulled voice... Thus on saying to Lakshmana, Rama then spoke to Jataayu. [3-68-3]"
3-68-4,"Oh, Jataayu, if you are in fine fettle to further reiterate words, relate about Seetha, let safe betide you, and recount how you are murdered, too... [3-68-4]"
3-68-5,"What is the reason for Ravana in stealing that noblewoman, and even what is the wrong I have committed in his respect, keeping which in view that Ravana stole my ladylove... [3-68-5]"
3-68-6,"How was that moon similar heart-stealing face of hers at that time of abduction, oh, best bird, and even what are the words she uttered when being abducted... [3-68-6]"
3-68-7,"What is his stamina of that demon? What is his form? And what are his strategies? And where is his stronghold? Oh, sire, tell me while I ask you inquisitively... Rama urged Jataayu thus for information. [3-68-7]"
3-68-8,"Then that warm-hearted Jataayu with his eyes rolling upwards saw Rama and with a fluttery voice said this sentence to Rama who is wailing like an orphan. [3-68-8]"
3-68-9,"Resorting to his illusionistic devices like creating an immense and tumultuous windstorm and cloud-cover, the flagitious chief of demons Ravana abducted Seetha... [3-68-9]"
3-68-10,"That night walker hacked both my wings when I was overtired, and went southward taking the princess of Videha, Seetha, along with him... [3-68-10]"
3-68-11,"My sight is spinning and my lives are stifled, oh, Raghava, I am now seeing golden trees with cuscus grass as their treetops... [3-68-11]"
3-68-12,"In which spell of time Ravana has gone taking away Seetha, that spell is named as Vinda... if any riches are lost during that spell, the original possessor of those riches will repossess them very quickly... oh, Kakutstha, he that Ravana is unmindful of that fact and stole Seetha only to loose her... [3-68-12, 13a]"
3-68-13,"On stealing your ladylove Janaki, that chief of demons, Ravana, will ruin himself, as with a fish which swallows a baited fishhook... [3-68-13b, c]"
3-68-14,"Impractical is your anguishing for the daughter of Janaka, as you will delight yourself with Vaidehi in no time, on killing that Ravana in the vanguard of a war... Thus saying Jataayu paused for a while. [3-68-14]"
3-68-15,"Though Jataayu is speaking on to Rama with an alert mind, blood freely flowed from his mouth with shreds of flesh as death verged on him, even then he struggled to say. [3-68-15]"
3-68-16,"That demon is the son of Vishravasa... literally... the brother of Kubera... on saying thus, that lord of birds released his lives, which are unobtainable for oneself. [3-68-16]"
3-68-17,"But the lives of Jataayu departing from his body went into thin air before the very eyes of Rama who is still speaking to him with folded-palms, tell... tell more... [3-68-17]"
3-68-18,"Jataayu flopped his head on earth, sprawled his feet on ground, and then his body collapsed onto the surface of earth writhing jerkily. [3-68-18]"
3-68-19,"He who is worsened by very many mishaps that Rama, on seeing the mountainous eagle whose eyes are bloodshot and whose lives have gone, said this way to Soumitri... [3-68-19]"
3-68-20,"This bird which for years together lived fearlessly in Dandaka forest, a habitat of demons, that bird wilted to death, because of me... [3-68-20]"
3-68-21,"He who has longevity over many years, who actively strived for a long for rectitude, he is now killed and prostrating before the Time, because of me... alas... it is indeed impossible to infringe the Time... [3-68-21]"
3-68-22,"Lakshmana, this eagle which has dashed to rescue Seetha in order to render help to me is slain by that brute-forced Ravana, only because of me, you see... [3-68-22]"
3-68-23,"On abandoning great empire of eagles belonging to his father and forefathers this lord of bird has now abandoned his lives too, only for my sake... [3-68-23]"
3-68-24,"Universally noticeable are the protective, prepotent, principled ones that are the followers of probity, oh, Soumitri, even though their births are avian or bestial... [3-68-24]"
3-68-25,"To me, oh, enemy-inflamer, oh, gentle Lakshmana, anguish caused by Seetha&#39;s abduction is not that much, when compared with the anguish caused by the perish of this eagle, that too, because of me... [3-68-25]"
3-68-26,"As to how the celebrated and highly renowned king Dasharatha is venerable and honourable for me, likewise this lord of birds is also a venerable and honourable one to me... [3-68-26]"
3-68-27,"Oh, Soumitri, get the firewood and I will produce fire by friction of two sticks, as I wish to cremate this lord of birds who expired because of me... [3-68-27]"
3-68-28,"Oh, Soumitri, I will mount this lord of realm of birds onto the pyre and cremate him who is killed by a feral demon... Thus saying to Lakshmana, Rama said this to dead eagle Jataayu. [3-68-28]"
3-68-29,"Oh, greatly mighty king of eagles, by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to, you depart to the unexcelled heavenly worlds... you depart to those worlds that are destined for the virtuosos of Vedic-rituals, and to those worlds that are destined for the practisers of ascesis amid Five-Ritual-fires, and to those that are destined for un-retreating combatants, and to those worlds that destined for the donors of lands... So said Rama to the departed Jataayu. [3-68-29, 30]"
3-68-30,"On saying that way, that ethical-souled Rama mounted that lord of birds onto the pyre and he sorrowfully incinerated that eagle in a flaring fire of pyre, as he would do in respect of his own deceased relative. [3-68-31]"
3-68-31,"Then that resolute Rama on going into forest along with Soumitri hunted a robust-bodied, big Rohi animal, or, Kesari animal, and then he spread sacred grass on ground to place that offering to the deceased soul of that bird. [3-68-32]"
3-68-32,"On drawing up the flesh of that Rohi animal and lumping it to gobbets, that highly observant Rama placed those gobbets on pleasant greenish pasturelands as obsequial offerings in respect of that bird Jataayu. [3-68-33]"
3-68-33,"Rama immediately chanted Vedic hymns that are employed in such funerals of one&#39;s own paternal people, as Brahmans say that those hymns are employable in such rites as they lead the soul of the departed to heaven. [3-68-34]"
3-68-34,"Then both the sons of that notable man, namely Dasharatha, on going to River Godavari they have oblated waters for that king of eagles, Jataayu. [3-68-35]"
3-68-35,"Both of the Raghava-s took funeral baths in the waters of River Godavari and then made water oblations to the king of eagles. [3-68-36]"
3-68-36,"That king of eagle Jataayu, who has performed a creditworthy deed of stalling and combating Ravana, but who is felled by that Ravana, went away to the merited and auspicious heavenly realms of his own, as and when consecrated by sublime sage like Rama. [3-68-37]"
3-68-37,"Even those two, Rama and Lakshmana, on performing water oblations in respect of that best bird Jataayu, and on assertively giving thought to the information given by Jataayu, they like the chiefs of gods, namely Vishnu and Indra, went to southerly woods when their mind is set to search for Seetha. [3-68-38]"
3-69-1,"In this way, Raghava-s on offering water oblations to Jataayu went southwestward in the forest and proceeded looking around for Seetha. [3-69-1]"
3-69-2,"On going in southwest direction, both the Ikshvaku-s wielding bows, arrows, and swords, have come about a pathway which is an off the beaten track. [3-69-2]"
3-69-3,"That pathway is thickly wrapped in and penned up with numerous trees, climber plants, and hedgerows from all over, thus that is jammed, blocked and horrid in its appearance. [3-69-3]"
3-69-4,"On taking up the southern direction, and on crossing over that highly horrendous and thick of the forest, both those spryly energetic brothers moved ahead, speedily. [3-69-4]"
3-69-5,"Thereafter, both the highly vigorous Raghava-s have entered the impassable Kraunca forest, on going three krosa-s from Janasthaana. [3-69-5]"
3-69-6,"Those two brothers who are disquieted by the abduction of Seetha are now agog to find her, and they intently explored that forest temporising there and there. That forest is evocative of a congeries of many a black-cloud, and it embodies numerous flowers on many a flowered tree, numerous flights of birds flitting over them, and numerous animals sprawling under them, and with them that forest is as though highly rejoiced everywhere. [3-69-6, 7]"
3-69-7,"Then, both the brothers on passing over that Kraunca forest and on going from there eastwardly on a three-krosha route, those sons of Dasharatha have seen a horrendous forest in between Kraunca forest and Matanga hermitage, which is overspread with various thicketed and impassable trees, and over-sprawled by numerous gigantic predators and vulturine birds, and on scrutinising such a forest everywhere, there they saw a cave in a mountain, which is abyssal, equal to infernal region, and ever enshrouded by gloom. [3-69-8. 9, 10]"
3-69-8,"On getting at that cave those manly-tigers have seen a demoness nearby that cave, who is massive in shape and misshapen in her face. [3-69-11]"
3-69-9,"Both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, have seen a demoness there, who is an inducer of horror to the dunderheaded dullards, traumatic in her acts and truculent in her appearance, pot-bellied, pierce-fanged, overblown, pachydermatous, head hair shaggy, body shape lumpy-bumpy, and she is going on eating massive beasts. [3-69-12, 13]"
3-69-10,"Drawing nigh of those valorous brothers who are journeying on their way, that demoness actually clung onto Lakshmana who is going ahead of his elder brother, saying, come... let&#39;s romance... [3-69-14]"
3-69-11,"Closeting Soumitri in her embrace she told him this sentence, I am Ayomukhi, by my name... you won me by your heroic personality, by that way, none can win me over... thus, you alone are my lover... oh, hero, oh, my husband... you will romance with me on mountaintops, in rivers, and on sandy isles, till the end of this life... So is the love prattle of that demoness Ayomukhi. [3-69-15, 16]"
3-69-12,"When said that way that enemy-suppressor Lakshmana became furious, and upraising his sword he sheared off her nose, one ear, and one of her breasts. [3-69-17]"
3-69-13,"When her nose and ear are cut off that demoness of hideous mien yelled highly in a high voice, and she rushed off as she had rushed in at Lakshmana. [3-69-18]"
3-69-14,"When she fled those two brothers who are the eliminators of the friends of their enemies, have travelled further into the forest and entered a dense area of that forest, with their spiritedness as their guiding force. [3-69-19]"
3-69-15,"Though Lakshmana is the one with preparedness, properness, and pureness and thus a highly fulgent one by his persona, he prayfully said this sentence to his brother Rama whose anima is radiantly fulgorous. [3-69-20]"
3-69-16,"My left arm is strongly shuddering and my heart is as though distraught... and even undesirable forebodings are also bidding fair... [3-69-21]"
3-69-17,"Oh, exalted brother, thereby you be at the ready by paying attention to my expedient words... these forebodings are indeed portending to me as if some hazard is immediately ensuing... [3-69-22]"
3-69-18,"This eerily dreadful bird known to be Vanjulaka is loudly ululating as though presaging our triumph in any given conflict that may ensue... So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-69-23]"
3-69-19,"When those two brothers are searching entire forest for Seetha in that way, they heard a boisterous brouhaha emanated as though to completely shatter down that forest. [3-69-24]"
3-69-20,"As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the forest, that forest&#39;s cacophony appeared to be unbearably filling up that forest."
3-69-21,"As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the sky, that forest&#39;s cacophony appeared to be unbearably filling up that forest. [3-69-25]"
3-69-22,"But desiring to know the source of that noise that sword-wielder Rama has seen a gigantically giant-bodied and gigantesque-chested demon in a section of brushwood along with his younger brother Lakshmana. [3-69-26]"
3-69-23,"Then they both had to drew nigh of a waylaying demon Kabandha, who is situated frontally with an overgrown body, which is neckless, ergo headless, ergo mouth in paunch. [3-69-27]"
3-69-24,"That diabolical demon is peaking like a huge mountain, his hair is horripilate and thickset, and his gleam is like a dark cloud, and his sounding is like a thunder. [3-69-28]"
3-69-25,"Only one ochry eye blazing like the tongue of an inferno is there on his forehead, which forehead situated on his chest. That single eye with incisive and sharp-sight is broad beaming and wide angling, on which there are winglike eyelids. That monster is now licking his giant mouth that is stuffed with spearhead like fangs, as he has just finished a gobble, and the brothers had to drew nigh of such a demon. [3-69-29, 30]"
3-69-26,"He is eating the highly brutal bears, lions, predators, and elephants, and he is outstretching both of his deadly arms, each of which is stretchable to a yojana distance, and the bothers neared such a demon. [3-69-31]"
3-69-27,"That demon stayed waylaying the pathway of both the brothers who chanced there, while he is catching bears, divers flights of birds, and numerous choicest animals of those and those herds, gripping them with both of his long-reaching hands and hauling towards his mouth at his paunch, or dropping them off if they are unpalatable, and the brothers reached nearby of such a demon. [3-69-32, 33a]"
3-69-28,"On travelling just a krosha distance, then they have seen Kabandha, whose body is colossal, and who is heinous and hideous, and who is like living trunk fenced by its shoulders and arms, and who by his physique is very deadly in appearance. [3-69-33b, 34]"
3-69-29,"He that overlong-armed Kabandha outstretching his overlong arms snatched both of the Raghava-s, keeping them side-by-side in his fists, and wringing them with his might. [3-69-35]"
3-69-30,"Though they are the grapplers with swords and brandishers of unerring bows, and though outblazing is their pneuma and outstanding is their dexterity, both of those great mighty brothers lost control and had to yield themselves to that demon when he captured and dragged them. [3-69-36]"
3-69-31,"In that situation, that valiant Rama, the legatee of Raghava-s, is not verily anguished owing to his courage, but Lakshmana is very much anguished, as if he is callow and in an unsheltered state, and he that younger brother of Raghava, namely Lakshmana, also dejectedly said this to Rama, the legatee of Raghava-s. [3-69-37, 38a]"
3-69-32,"Oh, valiant brother, see me, who am out of control on my inner-self, and gone into the control of the demon... oh, Raghava, you leave me and get yourself released from the grip of the demon... [3-69-38b, 39a]"
3-69-33,"Indeed offer me as an offering to this quiddity, and you seek safety at your pleasure... and you will reach Vaidehi shortly... this is my belief... [3-69-39b, 40a]"
3-69-34,"Oh, Kakutstha, on regaining the kingdom of our father and forefathers, and when enthroned, oh, Rama, it will be apt of you to reminisce me always... So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-69-40b, 41a]"
3-69-35,"But when Lakshmana said that way, Rama said to Soumitri, Fret not thyself, futilely... oh, brave one, your king of persons will not get dismayed, futilely... [3-69-41b, 42a]"
3-69-36,"In the meantime, that ruthless, log-armed, fiercest demon Kabandha thunderously asked those brothers, Rama and Lakshmana. [3-69-42b, 43a]"
3-69-37,"Who are you two? Your shoulders are akin to the bull-humps, and you are shouldering longbows and brandishing broad swords, how have you come about this province? For god&#39;s sake, I come across my most dainty morsel... [3-69-43b, 44a]"
3-69-38,"What business you have here, and for which reason you have come here... you chanced for me who am sitting here and painfully ravenous... [3-69-44b, 45a]"
3-69-39,"Though you are with arrows, bows and swords, and though you are like bulls with sharp horns ready to gore... but they are all a waste, as your life has readily become ungainful on reaching nigh of my sight and arms... So said Kabandha, in his arrogant tone. [3-69-45b, 46a]"
3-69-40,"On hearing that sentence of that vile-souled Kabandha, Rama said this to Lakshmana with a wilted face. [3-69-46b, 47a]"
3-69-41,"Oh, truth-valiant Lakshmana, now coming to pass is a worst catastrophe, after a worse catastrophe, after a catastrophe...namely, the expiration at the hands of this demon presently, and the expropriation of Seetha previously, and the expulsion from kingship, still previously... nonetheless, without coming across that ladylove, this disastrous despair of ending our lives is coming about... [3-69-47b, 48a]"
3-69-42,"Oh, Lakshmana, the efficacy of Time is preponderant and proportional among all beings... oh, manly-tiger, why generalisation... see, as to how yourself and even myself are entangled in the tangles of life, even though we assert ourselves to be brave and best... [3-69-48b, 49a]"
3-69-43,"Oh, Lakshmana, to show its impact on each and every being Time, or God is unencumbered and unremitting... may he be a brave one or a brawny one... or, may they be those that have perfected their missilery... when Time chances their nigh, they have to founder... as with a sandy levee... [3-69-49b, 50]"
3-69-44,"Rama being the son of Dasharatha is an indomitable one, besides, a firmly and factually valorous one, by which he earned a great renown, and he on telling thus, and on looking over that recalcitrantly vengeful Soumitri, then Rama readied himself by his own steadied thinking. [3-69-51]"
3-70-1,"On prying at those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who are completely stowed in the hangman&#39;s halter-like arms of the demon, and who are enduring within it, Kabandha said this sentence to them. [3-70-1]"
3-70-2,"Oh, excellent Kshatriya-s, on seeing me who am miserably famished, really what for you stay cool? You are the godsend gobs of mine, and hence now you are almost dead... So said Kabandha to brothers. [3-70-2]"
3-70-3,"Lakshmana who is possessed by anguish, and who is determined to wreck revenge on that demon, said these expedient and advisable words to Rama on hearing that demon&#39;s word. [3-70-3]"
3-70-4,"This scurrilous demon quickly hauled in you and me to his face level, and he will quickly take us in, therefore, we will have to swiftly hack off his lengthy arms at his shoulder level... [3-70-4]"
3-70-5,"Gruesome is this gargantuan bodied demon, and triumphing over just with his arms he has utterly devastated this province, and he now wishes to end us... [3-70-5]"
3-70-6,"Oh, king Raghava, killing the non-aggressive is tantamount to the killing of animals that are led into Vedic-ritual in its midst is despicable to the kings... [3-70-6]"
3-70-7,"On hearing all of their conversation that demon is infuriated, and then widely opening his ferocious mouth he started to wolf down both of them. [3-70-7]"
3-70-8,"Then both the Raghava-s are very highly gladdened as the demon is hauling them towards his eye at shoulder level, and as they are the brothers with circumspection, they instantly mutilated his arms right at their shoulder joints only with two swords. [3-70-8]"
3-70-9,"Then that dextrous Rama with an unrestrained speed hacked off the right arm, and valiant Lakshmana on his part hewed down the left arm that speedily. [3-70-9]"
3-70-10,"He that overlong-armed Kabandha fell down with mangled arms, reverberated the sky, earth, and all of the ten points of horizon with a cacophonous voice, like a black-thunderous-cloud. [3-70-10]"
3-70-11,"That demon on seeing at his dissevered shoulders on which the gushes of blood are overflowing, he self-piteously asked those two bold ones thus as, who are you... [3-70-11]"
3-70-12,"When that great mighty Kabandha is asking thus, Lakshmana who has prosperous characteristics has informed him about Rama of Kakutstha, an unremitting dynasty. [3-70-12]"
3-70-13,"He is known to people by the name of Rama, the legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty, and you know me as his younger brother, Lakshmana, by my name... [3-70-13]"
3-70-14,"Countervailed from kingdom by mother this Rama is bluntly sent to forests, and he is on the rove in great forests along with me ad his wife... [3-70-14]"
3-70-15,"A demon stole his wife while he whose leverage is like that of god is living in the unpopulated forest... and wishing to retrieve her we came here... [3-70-15]"
3-70-16,"But who are you? Your legs are broken, and your mouth is infernal, yet it is on your chest, and alike a topless, rootless tree trunk you are sprawling in the forest, how so, or, for what reason? Lakshmana asked the demon thus. [3-70-16]"
3-70-17,"But Kabandha is highly delighted when Lakshmana spoke that way, as the words of Indra came to his memory, and he said these words in reply. [3-70-17]"
3-70-18,"Oh, manly tigers, by my providence you are revealed to me... welcome to you... and providentially sheared are these shackles, called my two arms, by you... [3-70-18]"
3-70-19,"Oh, manly tiger, actually how this form of mine is disfigured, of course owing to my distrustful behaviour, that you may listen while I narrate it to you. [3-70-19]"
3-71-1,"Oh, great dextrous Rama with great daring and dashing, as to how the physique of sun, moon, and even that of Indra is there now, my physique was also like that earlier, an unbelievable mien and renowned in all the three worlds... [3-71-1, 2a]"
3-71-2,"Such as I was with an admirable body, disguising myself in this kind of horrendous form which is utterly dreadful to the world, I was scaring the forest living sages, there and there... [3-71-2]"
3-71-3,"On one day, when a great sage named Sthuulashira was collecting divers forest produce for his Vedic-ritual, I scared him with this ugly form and I even exasperated him... [3-71-3b, 4a]"
3-71-4,"On seeing me that sage who is an enforcer of deadly curse cursed me in this way, &#39;that which is presently diabolic and despicable form of yours, hereinafter you will abide in this form alone...&#39; [3-71-4b, 5a]"
3-71-5,"When I begged that enraged sage as, &#39;even if I have committed this blasphemy owing to my blasphemous fate, will there be an end to this blasphemed form of mine, or not...&#39; and then he spoke this word to me... [3-71-5b, 6a]"
3-71-6," &#39;When Rama incinerates you in an uninhibited forest on chopping off your shoulders, then you will regain your own grand and auspicious form...&#39; So said the sage to me... [3-71-6b, 7a]"
3-71-7,"Oh, Lakshmana, you may know as the most handsome son of Danu, and this misshapen form has chanced on me owing the ire of Indra in battlefield... [3-71-7b, 8a]"
3-71-8,"I have gladdened Grandparent Braham with severe ascesis and He granted longevity to me, and then a kind of recalcitrance touched off in my mind... [3-71-8b, 9a]"
3-71-9," &#39;When longevity is acquired by me what Indra can do to me...&#39; thus relying upon that kind of certitude, I jousted with Indra in a bout... [3-71-9b, 10a]"
3-71-10,"But the Thunderbolt that has a hundred cutting edges and that which is launched from Indra&#39;s hand has rammed by head and thighs into my body... [3-71-10b, 11a]"
3-71-11,"When I begged of him saying, &#39;lead me to the hell of Yama, rather than making me to live this hell of a body...&#39; Then Indra said this to me, &#39;Let the Grandparent Brahma&#39;s word about your longevity come true...&#39; Thus Indra spared me to me... [3-71-11b, 12a]"
3-71-12," &#39;By the impaction of Thunderbolt disarranged are my thighs and head, thereby my mouth went into my stomach... and without thighs how can I prowl, without arms how can I scrabble, and without a mouth how can I guzzle... and how am I capable to live on, and even that living too, is destined for too long a time...&#39; [3-71-12b, 13a]"
3-71-13,"When I said to Indra this way, Indra devised for me yojana long arms, also that way a rapier-fanged mouth in my paunch... [3-71-13b, 14a]"
3-71-14,"Such as I am, I have been eating the lions, elephants, animals, and tigers that are on the move in this forest, hauling them in with both of my overlong arms... [3-71-14b, 15a]"
3-71-15,"Indra has also said to me, &#39;as and when Rama hacks off your arms along with Lakshmana in a conflict, then you can go to heaven...&#39; Thus Indra said to me and vanished. [3-71-15b, 16a]"
3-71-16,"Oh, sire, I am grabbing whatever I see in this forest while living with this body... oh, powerful king, as I feel it meetly and a must for me... [3-71-16b, 17a]"
3-71-17,"I believed that Rama will certainly come nigh of my captivity, and confiding myself in this kind of determination, presaged by sage Sthuulashira, as well... I have been toiling to dislodge this body... [3-71-17b, 18a]"
3-71-18,"Oh, Raghava, as to how this has happened in this way according to the sum and substance told by the sage Sthulashira, you alone are that Rama, let safe betide you, and none other than you is capable to mangle me... [3-71-18b, 19a]"
3-71-19,"Oh, impetuous man Rama, if I were to be beatified by you two by incinerating me in Fire, I will advice you about the next course of your action... I will further advise you about your prospective friend... So said Kabandha to Rama. [3-71-19b, 20a]"
3-71-20,"When Raghava is said thus by that Kabandha, the heir of Danu, that duty-minded Rama said this word to Kabandha while Lakshmana is hearing. [3-71-20b, 21a]"
3-71-21,"Ravana conveniently stole my illustrious wife when myself and my brother exited from Janasthaana... [3-71-21b, 22a]"
3-71-22,"I only know his name but not the form of that demon... and we are unaware either of his stronghold or of his staying power... [3-71-22b, 23a]"
3-71-23,"It will be apt of you to show befitting mercy on us who are anguished by agony, running all over helter-skelter like unsheltered ones, and we who will be compliant for your restitution... [3-71-23b, 24a]"
3-71-24,"Oh, brave Kabandha, on bringing dried up firewood that was rent at times by elephants, and on digging a large trench, we will incinerate you in it... [3-71-24b, 25a]"
3-71-25,"Such as you are, if you actually know who stole Seetha, or whereto she is stolen, either... you clearly inform of her when incinerated, thus you will be rendering a most gracious deed to me, and to all concerned... Thus Rama made clear of his case. [3-71-25b, 26a]"
3-71-26,"When he is said thus that expert articulator Kabandha replied Rama, who is also an expert enunciator, with expedient words. [3-71-26b, 27a]"
3-71-27,"There is no divine knowledge to me as of now... nor I can identify Maithili... but when I am burnt I assume my own original divine form, and then I will be able tell about him, who will find her out... [3-71-27b, 28a]"
3-71-28,"With this unburnt body, oh, Rama, I indeed have no ability to discern anything, hence oh, lord, I will be able to speak about him who can familiarise you with that great mighty demon, by whom your Seetha is stolen, only after that incineration... [3-71-28b, 29]"
3-71-29,"Oh, Raghava, utterly distorted is my acumen, indeed, by the blemish of curse... and this form which is despicable to world has bechanced only because of my own antics... [3-71-30]"
3-71-30,"Oh, Rama, soon you have to toss me into trench to burn me customarily, sooner than the Sun&#39;s going to Mt. Dusk when his horses are fatigued... [3-71-31]"
3-71-31,"Oh, Rama, the legatee of Raghu, when I am scripturally burnt by you in a trench, oh, great valiant Rama, for sure, I will tell of him, who can quiet fathom that demon... [3-71-32]"
3-71-32,"Oh, Raghava, you have to befriend him with an amicable comportment... and that valiantly alacritous one will be gladdened by the sequel of your friendship, and he will evolve a succour to you... [3-71-33]"
3-71-33,"Oh, Raghava, nothing is there in all the three worlds that is unfamiliar to him, for he circumnavigated all worlds once, in a different context... [3-71-34]"
3-72-1,"When Kabandha said that way, both those brave men and lords of people, on throwing the body of Kabandha into a mountain cleft and then embedded it with firewood. [3-72-1]"
3-72-2,"On his part Lakshmana started to torch that pyre with highly sparkling torches from all over, and even that pyre too suddenly blazed with blazes from all over. [3-72-2]"
3-72-3,"That massy body of Kabandha is full with fat and while it is being cooked, it is in simile with a massy gob of ghee. But the Fire had to stew that body tardily, though that stewed meat is Fire&#39;s favourite dish, because of that body&#39;s massiveness. [3-72-3]"
3-72-4,"In a trice that highly dynamic Kabandha zoomed up shoving off that pyre, and he is now attired in lily-white vestments and angelic garlands, and appeared like a fumeless fire. [3-72-4]"
3-72-5,"Then highly gladdened Kabandha jumped up onto sky from the pyre, and there he is irradiant with unsullied clothing, and fineries decorated on every limb. [3-72-5]"
3-72-6,"On going to firmament Kabandha is now seated in a dazzling celestial aircraft yoked with swans, which endows renown because it takes the occupants to the realms of Brahma, and sitting in that celestial aircraft he said this sentence to Rama, while his own great glimmer and glitter beamed forth in all ten quarters. [3-72-6, 7]"
3-72-7,"Oh, Raghava, how you will regain Seetha, that you listen from me in its essence... oh, Rama, by which and which analyses everything will be analysed, six of such ideations are available in this world... and when a person is touched down by a spell of nemeses, he shall adore one who is equally in such spell of nemesis... [3-72-7b, 8]"
3-72-8,"Oh, Rama, you along with Lakshmana went into a spell of nemesis, and thus you have become an underprivileged one, and that spell alone has obtained you this dire straits, in the form of abducting your wife... [3-72-9]"
3-72-9,"Oh, best among kind-hearted ones, thereby you have to certainly befriend such a soul in similar dire straits... however deeply I may think, I am not able to perceive your accomplishment if you do not befriended with such a soul... [3-72-10]"
3-72-10,"Oh, Rama, listen what I tell... a vanara is there by name Sugreeva, who is vengefully reneged by his brother Vali, the son of Indra... [3-72-11]"
3-72-11,"That self-respectful valiant Sugreeva is living on the Mt. Rishyamuka, a best mountain available in the lambent fringes of Pampa Lake, along with four other vanara-s. [3-72-12]"
3-72-12,"He that Sugreeva is a masterful one among vanara-s, highly mettlesome, self-resplendent, and illimitable is his self-radiance... and he is also truth-bound and culture-bound... a mastermind, master-hand and a taskmaster... [3-72-13]"
3-72-13,"He is a capable adventurer, a courageous exploiter and incomparable one in intrepidity and a brave one in incursions, and his personality will be coruscating ever and anon, for he is the son of Sun-god... but he is banished by his self-conceited brother owing to the reasons of kingdom... [3-72-14]"
3-72-14,"Oh, Rama, he will be your associate and an aid in searching for Seetha, and he conducts himself in your wellbeing, hence let not your heart yield to agony... [3-72-15]"
3-72-15,"Oh, tigerly Ikshvaaku, further nothing can be countermanded in this world which is indeed ineluctable, and it is impossible to countervail against Time, isn&#39;t it... [3-72-16]"
3-72-16,"Oh, bold one, you go straight from here to that great mighty Sugreeva, and oh, Raghava, on going from here now and promptly you fraternise with Sugreeva... and to not to bode any ill of unfriendliness among you two, you make him a friend before blazing Fire, making that Fire as an Attestor of your friendship... [3-72-17, 18a]"
3-72-17,"You shall not look down on that lord of monkeys taking him as a lowly simian, why because that Sugreeva is a valiant one, a guise changing wizard and presently he is in the need of a bolsterer, and if you render help he will be obligated to you for ever... [3-72-18b, 19]"
3-72-18,"Now you two are capable enough to effectuate the desired task of Sugreeva, isn&#39;t it... whether his own purpose is achieved through you or not, he will effectuate your task... [3-72-19b, 20a]"
3-72-19,"Sugreeva is the son of Riksharaja, and the direct son of the Sun, but Vali trespassed against him. Wary of Vali&#39;s onslaughts Sugreeva is wandering around Pampa... [3-72-20b, 21a]"
3-72-20,"Oh, Raghava, right away and candidly you make that monkey Sugreeva, a wanderer in the forest, sheltering himself on Mt. Rishyamuka, as a friend of yours taking an oath on your weapon besides the Fire-witness... [3-72-21b, 22a]"
3-72-21,"With his expertise that straightforward monkey Sugreeva is indeed conversant with all of the strongholds of anthropophagite demons in the world in their entirety... [3-72-22b, 23a]"
3-72-22,"Oh, enemy-subjugator Rama, as far as the thousand rayed sun manifestly irradiates the world, oh, Raghava, thus far, nothing in the least is unfamiliar to him, isn&#39;t it... [3-72-23b, 24a]"
3-72-23,"He makes the monkeys to purposefully rake over the expansive rivers, extensive mountains and their impassable cliffs and caves in locating your wife... [3-72-24b, 25a]"
3-72-24,"Oh, Raghava, he expedites giant bodied monkeys in all directions to search for her, who is agonised by your parting, and he quests after the residence of Ravana for that comely lady Maithili... [3-72-25b, 26]"
3-72-25,"Whether that unreprovable ladylove of yours, Seetha, is located on the tops of Mt. Meru&#39;s peaks, or abiding on the planes of nadir of the earth, he that defiant one among fly-jumpers, Sugreeva, on entering there and annihilating the demons, he again bestows Seetha to you... So Kabandha continued his advise to Rama regarding Sugreeva. [3-72-27]"
3-73-1,"On showing a concept for questing after Seetha that context-sensitive Kabandha further spoke this sentence which is inclusive of right concept to Rama. [3-73-1]"
3-73-2,"Oh, Rama, have a recourse to westward, and where the trees of Rose-apple, Priyaala, Jackfruit, Plaksha, Banyan, Tinduka, Pipal, Karnikara, Mango, and others... and even trees like Dhanva, Naaga, Tilaka, Naktamaala, blue Ashoka, Kadamba, Karaviira, Agnimukha, Ashoka, red-sandalwood trees and Neem trees will be heart-pleasingly shining forth in full blossom, that alone is an optimistic course for you. [3-73-2, 3, 4, 5a]"
3-73-3,"On shinning up those trees, or else, even on forcefully pelting those fruits down onto ground, then you may pelt over, devouring those ambrosial fruits... [3-73-5b, 6a]"
3-73-4,"On crossing over that parkland, oh, Kakutstha, another parkland with blossomy flowers is there, which replicates the heavenly Nandana gardens, and a replica of North-Kuru, an all-endowing province... [3-73-6b, 7a]"
3-73-5,"Wherein the trees fruit all-season fruits that transude nectar, why fruits alone, in that parkland all seasons are coeval, as they will be in Caitraratha, the celestial gardens of Kubera... [3-73-7b, 8a]"
3-73-6,"In there, the trees bear enormous branches which will be crouching under the weight of their own fruits, and everywhere such trees will be shining forth like shiny clouds and shining mountains... [3-73-8b, 9a]"
3-73-7,"Let Lakshmana present those ambrosial fruits to you either by climbing up those trees to pluck them, or else by pelting them to ground, according to his convenience... [3-73-9b-10a]"
3-73-8,"Peregrinating finest places by trekking from mountain to mountain, from forest to forest, oh, valorous ones, you will trek to an auspicious lotus-lake, called Pampa... [3-73-10b, 11a]"
3-73-9,"It is un-pebbly, un-slippery, un-weedy thereabouts, oh, Rama, equal are its quaysides and emersed are its sandbanks, red and blue lotuses beautify that Pampa Lake... [3-73-11b, 12a]"
3-73-10,"There the indwellers of Pampa Lake&#39;s waters, oh, Raghava, namely the swans, cranes, Kraunca-s and fish-hawks will be letting out peeps in tuneful voice... [3-73-12a, 13b]"
3-73-11,"Thereabout birds will be unflustered on seeing humans, because they are artless to avoid hunting, because none kills them, and you may savour them because those birds will be best and burley, similar to ghee-gobs... [3-73-13b, 14a]"
3-73-12,"Oh, Rama in that Pampa Lake there are best fishes, red-carps, and blunt-snouted small porpoises, and a sort of sprats, which are neither scraggy, nor with many fish-bones. Lakshmana will reverentially offer them to you on skewering them with arrow, and on broiling them on iron rod of arrow after descaling and de-finning them. [3-73-14b, 15, 16a]"
3-73-13,"While you eat those fishes to satiety, Lakshmana will offer you the water of Pampa Lake, which will be in the bunches of flowers of that lake, and which will be lotus-scented, pellucid, comfortably cool, shiny like silver and crystal, uncontaminated and that way pristine, by lifting it up that water with lotus leaf, making that leaf a stoup-like basin... [3-73-16b, 17, 18a]"
3-73-14,"Oh, best one among men Rama, at Pampa you will see best shaped Vanara-s who have their bunk bed in mountain caves, and who will be coming nearby the lake, greedy as they are for water, and those forest movers will be moving about in evening time of the day, bellowing like bulls... oh, Rama, Lakshmana will show them to you... [3-73-18b, 19, 20a]"
3-73-15,"While roving in the evenings, oh, Rama, should you see the serenely water of Pampa, with her trees garlanded with their own blooms and twigs, you will discard your own dolour... [3-73-20b, 21a]"
3-73-16,"Oh, Raghava, there you will see highly delightful and wide-ranging trees like Tilaka and Naktamaala, and fully bloomed red and blue lotuses, as well... [3-73-21b, 22a]"
3-73-17,"Oh, Raghava, there is none someone to inwreathe the garlands of those flowers, and indeed, they neither dry up, nor drop down... [3-73-22b, 23a]"
3-73-18,"Erst there were self-collected sages, the disciples of Sage Matanga, and at one time while they were bringing the forest produce as ritual paraphernalia, they were much wearied by its weight and they were sweating... and all of those earthbound strings of sweat-drops that quickly dropped from their bodies were wafted by air onto trees, and on them they reoccurred as strings of flowers, by the merit of the ascesis of those sages... oh, Raghava, since those flowers have emerged from sweat-drops, they are imperishable, indeed... [3-73-23b, 24, 25]"
3-73-19,"Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, albeit the passing of those sages through the pearly gates, their maidservant, a long-lived one and an anchoress, named Shabari, can be seen there, even today... [3-73-26]"
3-73-20,"Oh, Rama, she who always stands by probity will depart to the sphere of heaven, on attending to you, for you are the referent to god, and a reverent for one and all... [3-73-27]"
3-73-21,"Oh, Rama, thereafter on your taking course to that western bank of Pampa Lake, oh, Kakutstha, there you will see the unequalled and arcane place of hermitage of sage Matanga... [3-73-28]"
3-73-22,"Sage Matanga so methodised that woodland, where even the elephants are rendered incapable to trespass in that hermitage of sage Matanga disturbing its serenity... [3-73-29]"
3-73-23,"Oh, the legatee of Raghu, that woodland which in simile is like a godly forest, similar to the heavenly Nandana gardens, overspread with divers birds is renowned as &#39;Matanga woodland&#39;, and oh, Rama, you will take delight rejoicingly in that woodland... [3-73-30, 31a]"
3-73-24,"In front of Pampa there is a bountiful but an unclimbable mountain is there with trees in full blossom, which is well-protected by baby elephants, and which in earlier times was purposefully created by Brahma, and that alone is Mt. Rishyamuka... [3-73-31b, 32]"
3-73-25,"And should a man sleep on the heights of that mountain, and should he dream of gaining some riches in that sleep, he gains that much when he wakes up... [3-73-33]"
3-73-26,"But he who is diabolic in his deportment and devilish in comportment, climbs that and hopes to sleep soundly, demons capture him while he is in sleep, and rough him up to death, there itself... [3-73-34]"
3-73-27,"Oh, Rama, there the blaring trumpet-blasts of baby elephants that amuse themselves at Lake Pampa, and of those that are the indwellers of Matanga hermitage, even there on Mt. Rishyamuka are audible... [3-73-35]"
3-73-28,"The mighty and massy dark-cloud coloured elephants will be hitting head-on, and with dripping blood streams on their jumbo heads and temples, they disperse and move about separately, only to come together for yet another round of head-to-head collision... [3-73-36]"
3-73-29,"There the elephants are quenched on drinking water of Pampa Lake, that is daintily clean, and neatly clear, springlike for touch, and in which all scents of flowers of that lake are included, and then they will be collectively re-entering the forests, for they are forest ranging elephants... [3-73-37, 38a]"
3-73-30,"On your seeing the bears, also thus the tigers and even the exultant sapphire-blue Rurus with black stripes there, you will discard your distress... [3-73-38b, 39a]"
3-73-31,"But oh, Rama, a cavernous cave lidded with a boulder stone outshines on that mountain, and oh, Kakutstha, problematic is an entry into it... [3-73-39b, 40a]"
3-73-32,"On its right at its eastern opening a delightful lake with highly coolant waters is there, fringed with divers trees and fraught with numerous tubers and fruits... [3-73-40b, 41a]"
3-73-33,"Sugreeva dwells in that cave along with four other monkeys, and at times he will be available on the peaks of that mountain, even on its bluffs and cliffs, for he is a terrified monkey... Thus Kabandha informed them. [3-73-41b, 42a]"
3-73-34,"That impressive Kabandha adorned with divine garlands and abiding in sky scintillating with the grandeur of the dazzle of the sun has bidden both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana thus, awaited a bid adieu from them. [3-73-42b, 43a]"
3-73-35,"Rama and Lakshmana who started off on their peregrination said this sentence to that highly providential Kabandha, who is temporising in the sky in their vicinity, thus as you may proceed... [3-73-43b, 44a]"
3-73-36,"On getting the orders for departure from those two brothers who are highly gladdened at the information given by Kabandha, he that Kabandha who is ready to exit, he further said to them thus, proceed for the purpose of achieving your task... [3-73-44b, 45]"
3-73-37,"Kabandha who redeemed his divine form has now got an aureole around him, and while irradiance is tamping whole of his mien, he moved further up on sky and reappeared. And staying in the sky he pointed out at the side of Mt. Rishyamuka, and then he reiterated, you befriend Sugreeva...and then he vanished. [3-73-46]"
3-74-1,"Both the sons of that best king Dasharatha, on taking up westerly path in that forest travelled on the passage to Pampa as shown by Kabandha. [3-74-1]"
3-74-2,"Those two, Rama and Lakshmana, while seeing several of the ticketed trees on mountains which have nectarous fruits on them moved forward to see Sugreeva. [3-74-2]"
3-74-3,"Those two legatees of Raghu on making a sojourn on the mountaintop, they the Raghava-s drew nigh of the moorland on the westward of Pampa Lake. [3-74-3]"
3-74-4,"Then on getting at the westward moorland of that lotus-lake Pampa, there those two have spotted the idyllic hermitage of Shabari. [3-74-4]"
3-74-5,"On getting at that hermitage and on perusing at that picturesque environ that is wreathed round with several picturesque trees, those two came nigh of Shabari. [3-74-5]"
3-74-6,"On seeing them that sublimated yogi Shabari instinctively made palm-fold, got up imperatively, and then she braced the feet of Rama, and even that of sagacious Lakshmana, impressively. [3-74-6]"
3-74-7,"She gave them water for feet-wash and mouthwash, and other viands customarily affordable to visitants, and then Rama asked after that anchoress who is unflinchingly abiding in her duty. [3-74-7]"
3-74-8,"Oh, ascetically wealthy lady, perchance your deterrents in ascesis are completely overcome, somehow... your ascetic practises culminating, someway... your annoyances and ailments are adjusted, somewhat... isn&#39;t it! [3-74-8]"
3-74-9,"Oh, suave speaker, mayhap your sacred commitments are achieved, anywise... appeased is your self, anyway... and your subservience to your mentors brought to fruition, perchance... isn&#39;t it! Thus Rama enquired with Shabari. [3-74-9]"
3-74-10,"When Rama asked her in this way she that Shabari who is a senescent anchoress, sublimated yogin and an adherent to the sublimated yogis of higher rank, informed Rama remaining in his vis-�-vis. [3-74-10]"
3-74-11,"Just now, on your pleasing manifestation before me my ascesis is accomplished, and now only my birth is fructified, and now only my subservience to my mentors is well hallowed... [3-74-11]"
3-74-12,"Oh, best one among men, now all my ascesis is fructified when I personally worshiped you, who are none other than the best god among gods, thus the heaven will also be there for me... [3-74-12]"
3-74-13,"Oh, kind one, your blessed sight has sanctified me... and oh, endower of respect, by your beneficence I wish to go to those returnless worlds because I have subjugated those enemies of yours, viz.,<font color=""#B3003A"">ari SaD varga-s</font> in me, and I think my prayer to you is justified because you are a subjugator of such enemies... [3-74-13]"
3-74-14,"Divine aircrafts of unequalled refulgence have lifted those disciples of Sage Matanga in whose tendance I was, to welkin on your arriving at Chitrakuta... [3-74-14]"
3-74-15,"Those knowers of probity, highly providential, and eminent-saints have told me, &#39;Rama will come to this highly blest hermitage of yours along with Soumitri... and you have to cordially welcome them as your guests, and on your seeing him you will go to best worlds, where merit remains undiminished...&#39; [3-74-15, 16]"
3-74-16,"Oh, best one among men Rama, thus I was told by those highly providential sages, oh, best one among men, oh, manly tiger, and I have gleaned various forest fruits and eatables that occur on the moorlands of Pampa Lake for your sake... So said Shabari to Rama. [3-74-17]"
3-74-17,"When that graceful souled Rama is addressed thus by Shabari, he that Raghava enquiringly said this to that Shabari who is never ever debarred from esoteric knowledge and gnosis. [3-74-18b, 19a]"
3-74-18,"Your and your preceptors&#39; effectiveness is heard in effect from the wraith of the great souled Danu&#39;s son, Kabandha, and if you feel showing it like I wish to clearly see it, personally... Thus Rama asked her to show hermitage. [3-74-19b, 20a]"
3-74-19,"On hearing those words voiced by Rama, Shabari started to show that unique woodland to both of them. [3-74-20]"
3-74-20,"Oh, Rama the delight of Raghu&#39;s lineage... this one comparable to a crammed cloud that would be ever ready to yield much cherished cloudbursts, and compacted with animals and birds that are ever ready to enjoy seasonable rains, is that hermitage to which you have come, that way this woodland is well known as Matanga, meaning a cloud, or an elephant, or an elephantine cloud that showers blessings on all... and oh, highly resplendent Rama, you may see this nest, snuggery, where those contemplative souls, my teachers, used to conduct oblations into the Ritual-fires, orienting and worshipping them with Vedic hymns... [3-74-21b, 22]"
3-74-21,"Where those great sages that are highly revered by me used to offer flowers with their extremely doddery hands in the worship the Altar of Fire, this alone is that Altar of Fire raised at western end... [3-74-23]"
3-74-22,"Oh, best one from Raghu-s, by the efficacy of the ascesis of my teachers these Altars of Fire are with incomparable irradiance, and even now they are irradiating all of the directions with solemnity... see them... [3-74-24]"
3-74-23,"Enervated by dieting and straining they were incapable to go for sea bathing, and just at their thought process all the seven seas came close by, in coalescence... see them... [3-74-25]"
3-74-24,"On performing holy baths those sages have spread their jute cloths on those trees with their own doddering hands here at this place and oh, Raghu&#39;s legatee, those cloths did not dry even now by the touch of their hands... [3-74-26]"
3-74-25,"Which garlands they have knotted together with black-lotuses and other flowers while they were worshiping gods, these are really those garlands, and indeed there is no discolouration to them... [3-74-27]"
3-74-26,"You have seen what is seeable and you have listened what is listenable of this woodland in its entirety... thereby I wish to become a permittee, where you alone are my permitter, as I wish to castaway this sheathe of soul, called my body... to make that soul to move nigh of my teachers feet... [3-74-28]"
3-74-27,"Of which sages this hermitage is, and of which sages I am also a maidservant, I soulfully go the proximity of those contemplative souls... Thus, she appealed to Rama. [3-74-29]"
3-74-28,"Rama on hearing those duty-congruous words of Shabari along with Lakshmana, obtained a uniquely high rejoice and he also said, astonishing is this... [3-74-30]"
3-74-29,"Then Rama spoke to that Shabari who is firmed up in her faith towards her masters, oh, saintly lady, you treated me with deference... thus may go to your cherished worlds, where you can solace yourself with your masters... [3-74-31]"
3-74-30,"Thus that way said by Rama in consent, she who is wearing tufty-matted hair, jute-cloths, and deerskin as her clothing, she offered herself as an oblation into Ritual-fire, and then like a flaring fire, she went to heaven alone. [3-74-32, 33a]"
3-74-31,"Now she appeared as an angle bejewelled with angelic ornaments, wearing angle&#39;s wraparound and angelical flowery tassels, and bedaubed with suchlike cosmetics, and as with the scintillations of electric sparks she scintillated that province. [3-74-33b, 34]"
3-74-32,"Shabari who is a perfect yogin with perfected meditative concentration, now went to that sanctum locus where the blest souls of those sublime sages, namely her masters, saunter. [3-74-35]"
3-75-1,"While Shabari ascended to heaven with her own divine self-resplendence, Raghava who is with Lakshmana started to cogitate over the magnificence of Matanga disciples. [3-75-1]"
3-75-2,"That noble-souled Raghava on thinking about the efficacy of the disciples of Matanga, said to Lakshmana, who is the maintainer of Rama&#39;s well being, and who is thinking single-mindedly. [3-75-2]"
3-75-3,"I have seen a highly astounding hermitage of self-controlled sages, oh, gentle Lakshmana, in which the deer and tigers are at home, and which is adored by divers birds... [3-75-3]"
3-75-4,"Oh, Lakshmana, holy is our taking a bath in this holy Pampa Lake, for it is formed by the waters of seven seas, and even holier is our oblation of this holy waters to manes... [3-75-4]"
3-75-5,"What that was unpropitious for us is completely abated by our holy bath and holy oblations, oh, Lakshmana, propitiousness is standing en face us, thereby presently this heart of mine is highly gladdening... oh, lion-like man, indeed, heart alone hatches hope... [3-75-5, 6a]"
3-75-6,"Thereby, where Mt. Rishyamuka is beaming forth at its nearby, on which that right minded son of the Sun, Sugreeva, is living along with four other vanara-s, always frightened by the fear from Vali, we will go to her, to that spectacular Lake Pampa, come on, Lakshmana... [3-75-6b, 7, 8a]"
3-75-7,"I am also hasty to see that best one among vanara-s, Sugreeva, for my enterprise called search for Seetha is under his aegis, isn&#39;t it... [3-75-8b, 9a]"
3-75-8,"To that brave Rama who is speaking thus, Soumitri said this,  my heart too is hastening me, let us go there promptly... [3-75-9b, 10a]"
3-75-9,"Then that Lord of People and Lord of Nature on exiting from that hermitage, he then came nigh of Lake Pampa along with Lakshmana. [3-75-10b, 11a]"
3-75-10,"Rama on scrutinising that rosy woodland in which everywhere there are outsized and diverse trees that are thickset with flowers, and different lakes loaded with the trilling birds like plovers, peacocks, waterfowls and suchlike, with which that woodland itself is trilling in much ado, became impassioned as he is instantly rendered thus by Love-god, and thus that Rama went towards that lovely Lake Pampa. [3-75-11b, 12, 13]"
3-75-11,"Rama spotted Pampa Lake from a distance which is plethoric with water, but entered into a lake called Matanga Lake on his way to Pampa... [3-75-14]"
3-75-12,"Though both Raghava-s came there composedly and dispassionately, but Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is ensorcelled by anguish on seeing a ladylike lake Pampa. [3-75-15]"
3-75-13,"Rama entered the area of that beautiful lake which is beaming forth with lotuses hemming in from inside, and trees like Tilaka, Ashoka, Punnaga, Bakula, Uddala, are hemming it from outside. [3-75-16]"
3-75-14,"That lake is huddled with delightful fringe lands and lotuses squeeze it from within, and its water is plethoric and crystalline, and its sand is softish all over. [3-75-17]"
3-75-15,"That lake is beautified with packs of fishes and tortoises, and packs of trees on its banks, on which climber plants are wraparound like the ladyloves of those trees. [3-75-18]"
3-75-16,"And that is adored by the beings like sylvan, reptilian, celestial, georgic, and elfish beings, and it is overcrowded with trees and tendrils, and it is a trove for fairish and clodish water. [3-75-19]"
3-75-17,"The lotuses of the lake are rich in their fragrance, and with the heaps of clusters of reddish, whitish, and blackish lotuses, and with such pinkish, whitish, and reddish lotuses the sheet of water is like a picturesquely painted canvas and it is surrounded by the orchards of flowered mango trees and sounded much by the screams of peacocks. [3-75-20, 21]"
3-75-18,"Then Rama along with Lakshmana on seeing at that Pampa Lake, that self-refulgent son of Dasharatha whimpered over, owing to his passionate recollection of Seetha. [3-75-22]"
3-75-19,"That Pampa Lake is wraparound with the trees of Tilaka, Citron-fruits, Banyan, White-trees, likewise flowered are flowery trees like Red oleanders, Punnaaga, shrubs of Maalati and Kunda, likewise flowered are the trees of Madder, Nicula, Ashoka, and Seven-leaved banana plants, and plants of Mogra and climbers of Maadhavii Lata are also flowered, and with them she that Ladylike Pampa shone forth like a pulchritudinous lady. [3-75-23, 24]"
3-75-20,"The aforesaid mountain renowned as Rishyamuka which is abounding with colourful ores and amazingly flowered trees is there on the bank of Pampa Lake. [3-75-25b, 26a]"
3-75-21,"A noble soul by his name Risharaja was there and that monkey&#39;s son is the highly valiant Sugreeva, thus he is renowned, and he presides over that mountain. [3-75-26b, 27b]"
3-75-22,"That best one among men Rama, said this way, oh, Lakshmana, you make a headway for that chief of monkeys, Sugreeva... and further said this to Lakshmana whose valiance is truthfulness alone, how can I possibly live without Seetha... [3-75-27b, 28]"
3-75-23,"Such as he is whose thinking is applying itself to Seetha alone, and who is vocalising his anguish for her, to whom aa stymie is laid by the Love-god just at the appearance that lake, that Rama on saying that sentence in that way to Lakshmana neared that superb and heart delighting lotus Lake Pampa. [3-75-29]"
3-75-24,"On going step by step, and on going on seeing ardently and intently at that forest which has picturesque visuals of forestry, and which is with hurly-burly birds, not one, but numerous and divers are they, and then Rama along with Lakshmana on entering the area of that lake, has seen that Lake Pampa. [3-75-30]"
4-1-1,"Rama, on arriving at that Lake of Lotuses called Pampa along with Lakshmana, which is full with lotuses, costuses, and fishes, lamented as his emotions are disturbed, on seeing the beauty of the Lake comparable with Seetha&#39;s face. [4-1-1]"
4-1-2,"There, on seeing that Lake of Lotuses, thrilled are his senses with gladness, and he engrossed and overcame by passion spoke this way to Lakshmana. [4-1-2]"
4-1-3,"Oh! Soumitri, magnificent is Pampa Lake with its cat&#39;s-eye-gem like waters, and she with her fully bloomed lotuses and costuses is beaming forth, along with many trees around her. [3-1-3]"
4-1-4,"Oh! Soumitri, see the forest of Pampa, the auspicious one in its appearance... where the mountains or trees lustre with their mountainous peaks... [4-1-4]"
4-1-5,"But I, who am well seethed by the anguish of Bharata, and even by the abduction of Seetha, am indeed distressed by my sensibilities and their distresses... [4-1-5]"
4-1-6,"This auspicious Pampa is pleasant to me with its delightful forests overspread with many diverse flowers, cool waters, though I am disquieted... [4-1-6]"
4-1-7,"Even enwreathed with lotuses this is remarkably sacred in its aspect... rambling snakes and elephants and restless are the deer and birds flocks, as well... [4-1-7]"
4-1-8,"All this is shining very much with bluish, yellowish grassland with a variety of trees... and with flowers covering it like flowery bed-sheet with variegated colours... [4-1-8]"
4-1-9,"Everywhere the treetops are fully flowered and the onus of those flowers is on the rise, though they are wholly embraced by climbers and their apices. [4-1-9]"
4-1-10,"Pleasing is this breeze, oh! Soumitri, and Manmadha, the Love God, prevails at this time, and prideful is this month with its fragrance, flowers, fruits and trees... all anew... [4-1-10]"
4-1-11,"See this figuration of these forests enriched with these flowers, Soumitri! Outpouring is the flower rain, like the rain from rain-clouds... [4-1-11]"
4-1-12,"Also on those appeasing terraces of mountains there are many forest trees... speed of winds are swinging them to shower flowers onto ground... [4-1-12]"
4-1-13,"These are the flowers already fallen, about to fall, or still on the trees, but everywhere the air is playing with these flowers, see that Lakshmana... [4-1-13]"
4-1-14,"The honeybees are displaced when the wind rapidly moved numerous branches of trees with full of flowers, and though displaced those bees are singing as though in accompaniment to the singing breeze... [4-1-14]"
4-1-15,"Breeze coming out from those mountain caves along with the high callings of lusty black cuckoos are making the trees to dance, and the air itself is as though singing as an accompaniment to that dancing... [4-1-15]"
4-1-16,"Entwined are the spires of trees when muchly moved by the air, thus the trees themselves seem to be entwined one with the other... [4-1-16]"
4-1-17,"He, this breeze is thus a happy one for touch, carrying a coolant and the fragrance like that of the sandalwood, and this breezing is a merited one and a fatigue remover... [4-1-17]"
4-1-18,"Air is vacillating these trees in this honey scented forest... and the trees appear to be enjoying their fluttering dance and seem to be swinging their treetops to appreciate the singing of honeybees that are humming in accompaniment to this dance... [4-1-18]"
4-1-19,"On mountain-planes that are beautiful with fully flowered and pleasant tress that entwine the mountain peaks with their high treetops, and thus these mountains indeed liven up with these great trees...[4-1-19]"
4-1-20,"Air is moving the treetops fully covered with flowers to swinging and the coronet like honeybees have to swing around those treetops, thus these trees themselves appear to be dancing to be dancing and singing... [4-1-20]"
4-1-21,"Fully flowered are these Karnikaara plants all over with golden colour flowers at top and yellow coloured stems, and they look like men wearing golden ornaments on their upper body, while their loin cloth is yellow... [4-1-21]"
4-1-22,"This spring with the soundings of many birds, oh! Soumitri, is enkindling grief in me, for Seetha is disunited...[4-1-22]"
4-1-23,"I, who am already pervaded by grief, am now well sweltered by the Love God, and this cuckoo that has happy calls is rather calling me down... [4-1-23]"
4-1-24,"This gallinule bird happily calling in the forest brooks is making me awesome with its calls, as the Love-god has already made me awestricken... [4-1-24]"
4-1-25,"Earlier when we were in hermitage, on hearing this bird&#39;s call, dear Seetha used to call me to listen, and she herself was highly cheerful at this bird&#39;s calls... [4-1-25]"
4-1-26,"Very many amusing birds of that kind are flitting all over on trees, bushes, and creepers emitting very many sounds... see them, Lakshmana... [4-1-26]"
4-1-27,"Well mingled are these female birds with their male ones, for which they are well admired by their own flock, oh! Soumitri, and such birds are calling gladsomely together with the pleasing humming of king-bees... [4-1-27]"
4-1-28,"At the shore of this Lake Pampa rejoicing are these birds in groups, and these trees loaded with the mating sounds of gallinule birds, and even loaded the callings of the male black cuckoos, are while inciting me they are inspiring love in me... [4-1-28, 29a]"
4-1-29,"The fire called spring season will burn me down with its fiery paraphernalia like the clusters of red flowers of hellebore that are akin to fireballs, the humming of honeybees that is alike the rustle of campfires, and the coppery red colour of tender leaves just sprouted that is identical to burning fire... [4-1-29b, 30a]"
4-1-30,"And if she with slender eyelids on her eyes, decent hairdo, and a soft spoken one, Oh! Soumitri, if she is unseen by me will there be any purposefulness of my life? [4-1-30b, 31a]"
4-1-31,"My dear Seetha has an enchantment for these enchanting woodlands bustling with koels up to their horizons, and Lakshmana, similarly enchanting is this vernal season to her... [4-1-31b, 32a]"
4-1-32,"This fire of grief born out of the throes of love, and furthered by the attributes of spring season will swiftly burn me down in no time... [4-1-32]"
4-1-33,"As the one unable to see that lady but able to see beautiful trees the Love-god in me gains intensity... [4-1-33b, 34a]"
4-1-34,"Now, that invisible Seetha is intensifying my agony, and this visible spring season, the remover of the touch of sweat too, is doing the same... [4-1-34b, 35a]"
4-1-35,"Overwhelmed with the grief of worry about that deer eyed Seetha, such as I am, I am burnt down by this cruel vernal breeze of forests...[4-1-35b, 36a]"
4-1-36,"And these peacocks that dance here and there are shining forth with crystal like windows on their plumage, when up-shoved by the wind...[4-1-36b, 37a]"
4-1-37,"Those peacocks that are surorounded by their peahens and convulsed in love are intensifying longing in me, who am already muffled in love-longing... [4-1-37b, 38a]"
4-1-38,"See Lakshmana, on that mountain terrace this peahen longing for love is dancing at the nearby of her husband, that peacock... [4-1-38b, 39a]"
4-1-39,"Spreading his beautiful wings and screaming as though joking, even that peacock is longingly running after his female... [4-1-39b, 40a]"
4-1-40,"Definitely no demon has abducted that peacock&#39;s ladylove, hence he is dancing with her in beautiful forests... [4-1-40b, 41a]"
4-1-41,"Living in this flowering month is unbearable for me... Lakshmana, see the fondness even in those originated in animals, thus that peahen in her passion is following her husband... [4-1-41b, 42]"
4-1-42,"Had she, that broad eyed lady Seetha, not been abducted, she too would have followed me in this way with an ecstatic love... [4-1-43]"
4-1-43,"See Lakshmana, while these forests are abundantly weighty with flowers in wintry season these flowers are becoming futile to me... [4-1-44]"
4-1-44,"Though these flowers on the trees are exceedingly beautiful they are falling onto the earth wastefully, along with the swarms of honeybees hovering over them... [4-1-45.]"
4-1-45,"These blithesome birds appear to be inviting each other in mutual consent, and they are melodious calling as they like, and this is causing love madness in me... [4-1-46]"
4-1-46,"Should this spring season be there too, where my dear one Seetha is living, she with her unrequited merriment will definitely be saddened like me... [4-1-47]"
4-1-47,"Definitely this spring season will not touch that place where she is... and even if this touches that place, how can that lady with black-lotus-eyes can possibly comport without me! [4-1-48]"
4-1-48,"Otherwise, even if the spring happens to be there where my dear is, what can that fine waisted lady do under threat by others? [4-1-49]"
4-1-49,"She in midst of her youth, eyes like lotus petals, also soft-spoken one is my dear one... and definitely taken by the spring she leaves her life... [4-1-50]"
4-1-50,"Indeed in my heart a strong notion is prevailing that the chaste lady Seetha will be unable to live separated from me... [4-1-51]"
4-1-51,"My thoughts of Seetha alone are well biding in me, and in Seetha also thoughts about me will always be abiding... [4-1-52.]"
4-1-52,"This breeze carrying fragrance of flowers is though pleasant for touch and though coolish like snow, this alone is like fire to me as I am very much worried about that lady... [4-1-53]"
4-1-53,"By which breeze I always felt happiness earlier along with Seetha... that breeze alone is increasing anguish in me without Seetha... [4-1-54]"
4-1-54,"When Seetha was with me, then this crow flew into the sky and cawed much indicating Seetha&#39;s departure from me, and now sitting on a tree it is cawing agreeably indicating early arrival of Seetha... [4-1-55]"
4-1-55,"This bird alone, then roving in the sky indicated about the abduction of Seetha... and this very same bird will now lead me near to that broad eyed one... [4-1-56]"
4-1-56,"Lakshmana, observe the appealing tonality of birds in the forest that calling out atop the flowered trees, that which is indeed furthering one&#39;s passion� [4-1-57]"
4-1-57,"That honeybee is quickly reaching these red flowers bouquets of Tilaka that are like his loved ones that are raising their faces with vigour�[4-1-58]"
4-1-58,"To the impassioned ones that Ashoka tree is very much enhancing grief, and with its bouquets of flowers hustled up by the wind it is sanding as though to daunt me... [4-1-59]"
4-1-59," Lakshmana, these mango trees bearing greenish yellow flower are appearing like men whose hearts are flirtatiously aroused, and who have creamed their bodies with greenish-yellow body cream� [4-1-60]"
4-1-60,"Oh, tigerly man Soumitri, see these Pampa&#39;s amazing forests ranges... and therein the nymphs are moving, hither and yon... [4-1-61]"
4-1-61,"See Lakshmana, these fragrant and propitious blue lotuses are everywhere in the waters, glistening like tender sun... [4-1-62]"
4-1-62,"This Pampa Lake is shining forth with its tranquil waters, that contain lotuses, blue water-lily&#39;s, and red lotuses, along with swans and water-birds that permeate it � [4-1-63]"
4-1-63,"Lotuses with the resplendence of tender sun enwrapping its waters, pollen grain pilfered by honeybees enwrapping those lotuses� with them this Pampa is beaming forth�"
4-1-64,"This Pampa is always bedecked with the ruddy geese, amazing deep areas of the forest, and with water thirsty herds of elephants and deer, and with them it gleams forth... [4-1-65]"
4-1-65,"In the tranquil water the speed of wind is throbbing ripples, and the ripples throb the lotuses, thus the throbbing and rippling lotuses appear beautiful� [4-1-66]"
4-1-66,"That one with lotus-petal-like broad eyes, who always holds the lotuses dear...without finding that Vaidehi... to me my life is uninteresting... [4-1-67]"
4-1-67,"Aha! Deplorable is the deviousness of Love-god, for he is causing reminisces about that graceful lady who articulates that gracefully, even if she is gone away and cannot be regained now... [4-1-68]"
4-1-68,"If this spring with its flowered trees is not going to deaden me... the Love-god is a possible one to tolerate, though now he came upon me forcefully...[4-1-69]"
4-1-69,"All those places or objects that were delightful ones to me when she was with me, and they alone are now becoming anguishing ones to me...for she parted from me� [4-1-70]"
4-1-70,"To gaze the petals of the lotus buds my sight is fascinated... and in them I perceive the pair of Seetha&#39;s bud-like eyes...Oh! Lakshmana...and they are alike thus... [4-1-71]"
4-1-71,"This breeze� let out from within the thickets of forests, breezing touching the pollen of lotuses, is reminding Seetha&#39;s exhale, as such it is heart-stealing� [4-1-72]"
4-1-72,"Soumitri, see those flowered Karnikara trees with their tree-trunks on those southern hill-terraces of Pampa, they are highly splendorous... [4-1-73]"
4-1-73,"That one, that kingly mountain which is ornamentally impregnated with ores and minerals is exhausting much mass of wondrous dust with the colour of its ores, that is drifted by the wind&#39;s speed... [4-1-74]"
4-1-74,"On the mountainsides, Soumitri, all over fully flowered are the exquisite Kimshuka trees, while their leaves are hidden under those reddish flowers, and with them that mountain is as though aglow... [4-1-75]"
4-1-75,"On the banks of Pampa these jasmines, water-lilies, red oleanders have grown up and they are now flowered that is wetted with the fragrance of nectar...[4-1-76]"
4-1-76,"The Mogra bushes, Sinduka, Vaasanti are well flowered. Maadhavi, flowers are also fully fragrant, and everywhere there are bushes of Jasmine... [4-1-77]"
4-1-77,"Charming are the saplings of Bilva, and Madhooka, and plants like Vakula, Champaka, Tilaka, Naaga trees are well flowered.... [4-1-78]"
4-1-78,"Padmaka plants are well flourishing, and like that Neela, Ashoka are also flowered... trees on the mountain terraces namely Lodhra trees are brownish like lion&#39;s mane... [4-1-79]"
4-1-79,"The trees of Alangium, Kurntaka, Poornaka, Devadaaru, and also the Mango trees, and like that Patala trees, and the trees of Mountain ebony are flowered...[4-1-80]"
4-1-80,"Muchukunda trees, also Arjuna trees are seen on mountain terraces...Date palm trees, Uddaalaka trees also... like that the Shiriisha tree, simshupa trees, and dhava trees... [4-1-81]"
4-1-81,"Silk cotton trees, palaasha trees also, like that are red mehandi trees, thus are Tinisha and Naktamaala trees, sandalwood trees, spandana trees are all thus well flowered... [4-1-82]"
4-1-82,"Flowered are the trees like hintaala, tilaka, and naaga trees, and they are enfolded by the flowered climber-plants at their apices... [4-1-83]"
4-1-83,"See the splendorous trees of Pampa here, oh! Soumitri...their branches bestirred by wind and bend onto other trees, as though these trees are nearby and within the reach of climber-plants... thus the climber-plants passionately bear upon those trees, like the doting of passionate women... [ [4-1-84, 85a]"
4-1-84,"And the breeze is perhaps unhappy by savouring only one kind of nectarine aroma, hence it appears to be gliding from tree to tree, forest to forest, mountain to mountain... while going from tree to tree, mountain to mountain, forest to forest... [4-1-85b, 86a]"
4-1-85,"Some trees are full with flowers whose nectar is fragrant, and some shine forth with dark colour as they are enveloped with buds... [4-1-86b, 87a]"
4-1-86,"And the honeybee on assessing each of the flower as &#39;this one is pure... this one is delicious... and this one is well bloomed...&#39; is plunging into them... [4-1-87b, 88a]"
4-1-87,"On plunging into the flowers that nectar-avaricious honeybee is again coming up, and quickly going elsewhere in the trees on the banks of Pampa... [4-1-8]"
4-1-88,"These clusters of flowers that have fallen on their own are spreading out like a bed of flowers laid on, with them the ground appears to endow comfort... [4-1-89]"
4-1-89,"On mountain slopes varied flowers are spread out, with them the colour of diverse mountain slabs is rendered into yellow-red hue... [4-1-90]"
4-1-90,"Soumitri see the bloom of flowers in spring after winter, as if the trees have indeed bore the flowers in competition with one another... [4-1-91]"
4-1-91,"The drones of honeybees among the trees with flowered treetops appear to be the talk of trees, and the swinging branches of trees appear to be their invitational gestures to one another, thus those trees look highly attractive... [4-1-92]"
4-1-92,"Entering the blessed waters this bird, partridge, is rejoicing together with his female, kindling desire in me too... [4-1-93]"
4-1-93,"This sort of heart pleasing nature is also available with River Ganga, and that alone reasonably signifies the popularity of River Pampa in the world... [4-1-94]"
4-1-94,"If that devot lady Seetha is found, and also if we were to stay here only, I neither think about Indra&#39;s throne in Heavens nor Ayodhya&#39;s throne, which is like Indra&#39;s throne on the earth... [4-1-95]"
4-1-95,"Nay... if I were to take delight this way in these pleasant green meadows along with her, there will be no worry to me... nor interest in other things... [4-1-96]"
4-1-96,"Indeed these beautifully leaved and variously flowered trees are maddening my heart as I am without that lady Seetha in this forest... [4-1-97]"
4-1-97,"See the cool water of this Pampa Lake, Soumitri, filled with blue lotuses, and with ruddy geese well moving in, and well venerated by the partridge birds...[4-1-98]"
4-1-98,"Well filled with waterfowls, curlew birds, and adored by great animals, this Pampa glistens much with pleasantly calling birds...[4-1-99]"
4-1-99,"Enkindling passion in me, are these umpteen gladdened birds, reminding me of my dear one who is in the mid of her youth, moonfaced, and with the radiance of lotuses in her eyes... [4-1-100]"
4-1-100,"See that female deer along with male deer moving there and there on those wonderful mountainsides... and at me, who am weaned away from such a fawn-eyed lady Seetha... and such as I am, my heart is further agonised on seeing these wide-eyed deer, and for not seeing her, the wide-eyed Seetha... [4-1-101]"
4-1-101,"If only I can see that lady on those spectacular terraces filled with impassioned bird groups with much ado, then there shall be peace for me... [4-1-102]"
4-1-102,"I live along for sure, Soumitri, if that slender-waisted Vaidehi basks in this benignant breeze of Pampa along with me... [4-1-103]"
4-1-103,"Lakshmana, the breeze from the greenswards of Pampa that carries the fragrance of lotuses including that of red lotuses is an auspicious one, an eliminator of melancholy, and those that adore such a breeze are fortunate ones... [4-1-104]"
4-1-104,"That youthful, lotus-petal eyed beloved of mine, that Janaka&#39;s daughter... how can that helpless lady bear her lives without me... [4-1-105]"
4-1-105,"What sort of well-being can I say to that virtuous and truth speaking King Janaka, if he enquires about Seetha&#39;s well-being among hosts of people? [4-1-106]"
4-1-106,"She who accompanied me, an unfortunate one whom his father sent to forests, taking up a virtuous course... now where will be she, that ladylove of mine, be abiding... [4-1-107]"
4-1-107,"Whose kingdom is forfeited, and whose soul succumbed to the circumstance at the time of exile, but she accompanied suchlike me, and Lakshmana, without her how I can I live on in desolation... [4-1-108]"
4-1-108,"She who has a pretty and beaming face with lotus-like eyes, that is fragrant, auspicious and scarless, and not seeing such a face my mind is as though sinking... [4-1-109]"
4-1-109," Lakshmana, when can I hear that conversation of Vaidehi that will have smiles and wits in between... wisdom wise pleasing, friendly and unique one in its own way... [4-1-110]"
4-1-110,"That youthful and decent lady though succumbed to suffering in forests used to look as though got rid of her sufferings, and as though gladsome woman, and she used to speak to me, one smitten by her love, very fondly... [4-1-111]"
4-1-111,"What can I say in Ayodhya to that kind hearted lady and my mother Kausalya, oh, prince Lakshmana, when she asks �where is she, my daughter-in-law? And how is she? &#39; [4-1-112]"
4-1-112,"Begone! Lakshmana.... you may see Bharata, that affectionate one for his brothers... I may not be able to live on leaving off Seetha... isn&#39;t so! [So said Rama to Lakshmana] [4-1-113]"
4-1-113,"To that great-souled Rama who is bewailing that way like a waif, his brother Lakshmana said these appropriate and infallible words. [4-1-114]"
4-1-114,"Oh, best one among men, please control yourself Rama, let safety betide you, do not lament, the intellect of your kind of unblemished souls does not become languorous... [4-1-115]"
4-1-115,"Recollect the sadness caused by departure of loved ones, and it may please be forsaken for some extent, with the embrace of too much of friendship of the water-drenched wick with oil, even that water-drenched wick burns in the lamp... [4-1-116]"
4-1-116,"On remembering the fondness for dear ones, intellect of your kind of unblemished souls will not become languorous. Leave off the sadness caused by separation."
4-1-117,"If Ravana goes to the netherworlds, or still deeper worlds from there, oh my brother, still he will not live, Raghava... [4-1-117]"
4-1-118,"Let the emplacement of that sinning demon e obtained... and then he either cedes Seetha or enters into his own doom... [4-1-118]"
4-1-119,"Even if he enters the womb of Diti along with Seetha, and if he does not give away Seetha, even there I wish to slay him,...[4-1-119]"
4-1-120,"May you rejuvenate and be secure, oh, revered one, cast-off your pathetic mood... result of purpose will be lost indeed, for the endeavourers without a try, thus nothing can be regained by them... [4-1-120]"
4-1-121,"Vehemence is might, oh, noble one, there is no superior might than vehemence and to him with vehemence there is no impossibility in the world,... even the slightest... [4-1-121]"
4-1-122,"Vehement men do not regress in deeds, and taking hold of vehemence alone we regain Seetha...[4-1-122]"
4-1-123,"You leave off this enclosure of ardency and pushback that compassion ... you are not able to know your great and controlled soul...with these thoughts of self-pity and fondness... [4-1-123]"
4-1-124,"Thus addressed by Lakshmana, then Rama whose conscience is marred by emotions, got rid of pity and fondness, and acquired courage, to perform the deed demanded of his incarnation. [4-1-124]"
4-1-125,"He that inestimable valiant Rama strode forward those areas of charming Pampa Lake, with the charm of wind-flopped trees, getting rid of grief. [4-1-125]"
4-1-126,"That great one Rama on observing all over quickly, all round the forest with its brooks and caves, and reviewing with Lakshmana, though agonised at heart that anguished one travelled on. [4-1-126]"
4-1-127,"While that great soul Rama is walking ahead, that great souled Lakshmana whose stride is also like that of an elephant, and whose deeds are agreeable to Rama, vigilantly protected Rama with an un-despaired mind and even by his virtue and strength. [4-1-127]"
4-1-128,"He who is the chief of Vanara-s, who moves about Mt. Rishyamuka, while he is meandering thereabout he happened to see those two who are so amazing for a look, namely Rama and Lakshmana, by which he is so frightened that he is petrified. [4-1-128]"
4-1-129,"On seeing those two Rama and Lakshmana who are advancing his way, he that great soul who is a tree-branch animal, and he who strides like an elephant, derived profound agony that muffled him in worry, and he is engulfed under the weight of his fear. [4-1-129]"
4-1-130,"On seeing those magnificent two, Rama and Lakshmana, the monkeys are frightened and fled towards the pious hermitage of Sage Matanga, which has an inland that is always adored by monkeys for it is consolatory and sheltering them. [4-1-130]"
4-2-1,"On seeing them the wielders of best weapons and audacious ones, two brothers and great souls, namely Rama and Lakshmana, Sugreeva became ambiguous. [4-2-1]"
4-2-2,"Distressed at heart that foremost monkey gazed blankly in all directions and he did not remain at any one place. [4-2-2]"
4-2-3,"On seeing those two great mighty ones that monkey has not even made-up his mind steadfast as he is very much frightened, and his heart is really sunken. [4- 2- 3]"
4-2-4,"He that righteous Sugreeva considering his own strength and weakness is much agitated, and along with all the other monkeys too are frightened. [4-2-4]"
4-2-5,"On seeing Rama and Lakshmana then that chief of monkeys Sugreeva with much dreadfulness said this to his ministers. [4- 2- 5]"
4-2-6,"Here they come wearing jute cloths and move about in this impassable forest deceitfully, definitely Vali must have dispatched them... [4-2-6]"
4-2-7,"Then on seeing the great archers Rama and Lakshmana the ministers of Sugreeva have gone from that mountain terrace to another high-peaked mountain. [4- 2- 7]"
4-2-8,"Then the group-leaders of monkeys quickly arrived as they fled, at that lofty monkey group-leader Sugreeva, the chieftain of monkeys, gathering around him there they stood at his nearby. [4-2-8]"
4-2-9,"Thus they reached to one course of return, after hopping from one mountain to the other, shuddering mountains and even thir peaks by their trample in hastiness. [4-2-9]"
4-2-10,"Then all of the tree-branch animals, who are great in their strength, have wrecked down the well-flowered trees that are clumped in that forest on that mountain by their swinging. [4- 2- 10]"
4-2-11,"While those best monkeys hopped everywhere they have frightened deer, wildcats and tigers on that great mountain. [4-2-11]"
4-2-12,"Then the ministers of Sugreeva, assembled on that best mountain and gathered around the chief of monkeys Sugreeva, and all stood with their adjoined palms. [4-2-12]"
4-2-13,"Then Hanuma, the ablest sentence-maker, said this sentence to Sugreeva who is dismayed with fear doubting Vali&#39;s mischief. [4-2-13]"
4-2-14,"Perplexity be warded off... all of you discarded that great fear from Vali or his cruelty... there is no scare from Vali here on this best mountain, for it is Mt. Malaya... [4-2-14]"
4-2-15,"By whom you are bewildered at heart and running away, oh, the best monkey Sugreeva, I do not see that cruel-looking, cruel Vali here... [4- 2-15]"
4-2-16,"From whom your fear is spurted, oh, gentle Sugreeva, that elder brother of yours, who is an evildoer and the one with harmful intent... that Vali is not here. Therefore I perceive no fear from him...[4-2-16]"
4-2-17,"Aha! You made a monkey of yourself, oh, monkey, and you feel small, thus you are not able to stay firm in your mind by that fickleness, and your monkeyshines is clear by it... [4-2-17]"
4-2-18,"Keep your intellect and wisdom firm, and express all your intents rightly in your body language in all your undertakings... certainly, a king getting into unintelligence cannot command all his subjects... So said Hanuma to Sugreeva. [4-2-18]"
4-2-19,"Sugreeva thus hearing entirely to all the propitious words of Hanuma spoke to Hanuma this opportune sentence, positively. [4-2-19]"
4-2-20,"Lengthy are their arms, broad are their eyes and they are the wielders of arrows, bows and swords... and on seeing them, to whom there will be no scare? These two are like the sons of some divinity... Sugreeva thus spoke to Hanuma. [4-2-20]"
4-2-21,"I presume these two... those best of men are abetted by Vali to assault me... for, the kings like Vali do have many friends and trusting them absolutely is an unpardonable mistake... [4-2-21]"
4-2-22,"By men the enemies are to be assessed... for, they move in disguise and distrustful enemies will trounce the complacently self-assured ones that relax in their own self-confidence on any possible occasion... [4-2-22]"
4-2-23,"In exploits Vali is an ingenious one... and the kings will be observing many aspects of their enemies to eliminate them... and they the kings are to be known even by ordinary people... [4- 2- 23]"
4-2-24,"Begone to them oh, monkey Hanuma, in a commoner&#39;s form, for your monkey-hood is distinguishable by Vali&#39;s agents, and know the intentions of those two by their conduct, by their semblance, and by their conversation, as well...[4-2-24]"
4-2-25,"Aim at their concepts and if they are pleasant-hearted, duly create confidence in them by conducting yourself, and also commending them again and again... oh, best of monkeys, Hanuma, set their face towards me alone in a compassionate manner, and you inquire about the reason of their entering this forest alone... of those bows wielders... [4-2-25, 26]"
4-2-26,"You shall know whether those two are clean at heart or otherwise, or about their evil-mindedness or otherwise by conversation... Thus Sugreeva said to Hanuma. [4-2-27]"
4-2-27,"Thus this way ordered by Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, Hanuma, the son of Air-god made up his mind to go there, where Rama and Lakshmana are. [4-2-28]"
4-2-28,"That marvellous monkey Hanuma agreeing for the words of that inaccessible and very much frightened Sugreeva, and on respectfully replying him saying that, &#39;I will do accordingly...&#39; proceeded there where that highly mighty Rama is there along with Lakshmana. [4-2-29]"
4-3-1,"Mindful of the words of noble-souled Sugreeva, Hanuma took his flight from Mt. Rishyamuka to where Raghavaa-s are. [4-3-1]"
4-3-2,"Casting off his monkey&#39;s semblance Air-god&#39;s son Hanuma attained the persona of an ascetic, for that monkey is incredulous in mind about Raghava-s. [4-3-2]"
4-3-3,"Then on nearing Raghava-s that Hanuma voicing softly and well pleasingly like an obedient one, that best monkey befittingly hailed, greeted and praised those two valiant ones. [4-3-3, 4a]"
4-3-4,"The best Vanara Hanuma spoke soft-wordily, as desired by Sugreeva, to those candidly resolute ones, on making reverent obeisance to both of them. [4-3-4b, 5a]"
4-3-5,"You two look like kingly saints, or deities by your build, ascetics with blest vows, but with ideal complexions... how come you arrived at this countryside scaring the herds of animals and other inhabitants of this forest... [4-3-5b, 6]"
4-3-6,"You mighty ones you are watching the trees grown on the banks of Pampa from all over, and owing to your presence on these banks you make this river Pampa with its propitious waters to shine forth... but you with your golden hue appear as courageous ones, yet you sigh over repeatedly, you wear jute-cloths, yet you look mighty shouldered... who are you that distress all the beings in this forest... [4-3-7, 8]"
4-3-7,"Dauntless, bold and brave are you with sharp glances of lions, wielding bows like that of Indra&#39;s bow you are the real enemy destroyers... glorious, splendid, and even impetuous you appear like Sacred Bulls... elephant&#39;s trunks are your arms... and you foremost among men are self-resplendent... [4-3-9, 10]"
4-3-8,"This lord-like mountain is effulgent with your effulgence, you two look as kingdom-worthy, or worthy divinities, but how you have reached this countryside now... [4-3-11]"
4-3-9,"Eyes of yours are like fine lotus petals, are you superhuman... nay, you wear tufts and braids, are you some undaunted human ascetics... nay, you look clonal, are you from some world of gods... nay, you are on earth, does this earth have a chance to receive Sun and Moon on her by her fortune... nay, are you some broad-chested deities in human form... lion-shouldered, very vehement and vigorous like Sacred Bulls... who you might be... [4-3-12, 13, 14a]"
4-3-10,"Also lengthy are your hands, and spherical are your shoulders similar to clubs... they are worthy for decoration with every kind of ornament, for what reason they are undecorated... [4-3-14b, 15a]"
4-3-11,"I deem that each of you are the choicest one to protect the earth adorned with Mt Meru and Vindhya range, and with all her oceans and forests... [4-3-15b, 16a]"
4-3-12,"And these awesome bows are polished with odd things are smooth, and they are brightening like the gilded Thunderbolt of Indra. [4-3-16]"
4-3-13,"Full with hazardous, life terminating, fiery snake like sharp arrows are these quivers, admirable in their appearance... [4-3-17b, 18a]"
4-3-14,"Dazzling are these amply wide, broad and gilded swords like the snakes just released from their moults... [4-3-18b, 19a]"
4-3-15,"When I have been talking to you this way, what for you don&#39;t speak up... one named Sugreeva, somebody virtuous and worthily one among monkeys is expelled by his brother Vali, and he is roaming all over the world sorrowfully... [4-3-19b, 20]"
4-3-16,"Delegated by that great soul and the king of important monkeys Sugreeva, I have come here and by name I am Hanuma, another Vanara... [4-3-21]"
4-3-17,"He that righteous Sugreeva is desiring friendship with you two, and know me as a monkey and his minister, the son of Air-god... I had to come here from Mt. Rishyamuka in an ascetic&#39;s form only to appease that Sugreeva, and I can wend my way by my will, and wear any guise as I wish... Hanuma said so to those brothers. [4-3-22, 23]"
4-3-18,"Saying thus to those valorous Rama and Lakshmana, Hanumaan, the sententious wordsmith, spoke nothing further. [4-3-24]"
4-3-19,"Hearing all those words said by Hanuma, that illustrious Rama is well pleased facially, spoke to his brother Lakshmana who is standing at his side. [4-3-25]"
4-3-20,"He is the minister of that noteworthy soul and king of monkeys, Sugreeva... whom alone I cherish, but he himself has drew nigh of me, on his own... [4-3-26]"
4-3-21,"Soumitri, with this minister of Sugreeva, the knower of sententiousness and a pleasant worded one, and one with friendliness you exchange pleasantries with that enemy destroyer Hanuma... [4-3-27]"
4-3-22,"Nay...the non-knower of Rig Veda, or the non-rememberer of Yajur Veda, or the non-scholar of Saama Veda... can possibly, or truly speak this way... [4-3-28]"
4-3-23,"Definitely grammar is severally and comprehensively learnt by him... and though much is said by him not a single word has gone amiss of verbiage... [4-3-29]"
4-3-24,"On his face or eyes, or on forehead or brows, or on other faculties of expression no fault is found...even at the least... [4-3-30]"
4-3-25,"Unexpanded, un-doubtful, un-delaying and non-dissonant is the tenor of his speech, and it comports in his chest or throat in a medium tone...[4-3-31]"
4-3-26,"He has orderly refinement in speech that is remarkable and un-delaying, and he speaks propitious words that are heart-pleasing...[4-3-32]"
4-3-27,"His speech is generated in three places is enthralling... and whose heart is it that is disenchanted, even that of an enemy after raising his sword at him, on hearing his speech...[4-3-33]"
4-3-28,"Oh, faultless Lakshmana, if this sort of envoy is not there to a king, really how can that king accomplishes his ways and means... [4-3-34]"
4-3-29,"Should a king have this kind of work accomplishers with a variety of virtues, all his objectives will be achieved impelled by such an envoy&#39;s words... Rama thus said to Lakshmana. [4-3-35]"
4-3-30,"When said thus by Rama, wise-worded Lakshmana spoke to that monkey and the minister of Sugreeva, namely Hanuma, the son of Air-god, who is equally a wise-worded one. [4-3-36]"
4-3-31,"The virtues of that great soul Sugreeva are known to us, oh, scholarly monkey, we for our part are in search of that lord of fly-jumpers Sugreeva alone... [4-3-37]"
4-3-32,"As you communicated the words of Sugreeva, oh, gentle Hanuma, by them and by your words we indeed wish to do accordingly... [4-3-38]"
4-3-33,"On observing that operative sentence of Lakshmana the monkey Hanuma is gladdened, as seen from his composure, and kept his mind at ease at the prospective victory, and then he wished to materialise the pact of friendship between Rama ad Sugreeva, at the earliest. [4-3-39]"
4-4-1,"Then that Hanuma, who has good deeds for his credit, on hearing the words ofLakshmana, and even knowing that they are finely meaningful, he rejoicingly recalled in his mindthat Sugreeva's effort is going to fructify. [4-4-1]"
4-4-2,"Conceivable is the retrieval of the kingdom by that great souled Sugreeva...and forwhich deed, this purposive Rama has come, and that deed desired by Rama is also achievable bySugreeva, and thus all this has came by... thus thought Hanuma. [4-4-2]"
4-4-3,"Then Hanuma, the ablest flyer is thus very gladdened...and in turn then spoke tothat very learned one, namely Rama. [4- 4-3]"
4-4-4,"What for you have come into these perilous forests hemming in Pampa Lake along withyour brother, for these are impenetrable forests abounding with many a serpent and animal? ThusHanuma asked Rama. [4-4-4]"
4-4-5,"On hearing the words of Hanuma, Lakshmana motivated by Rama, narrated about thegreat soul Rama, the son of Dasharatha. [4-4-5]"
4-4-6,"The king named Dasharatha, a resplendent one and the patron of virtue was rulingthe four-caste system with its, and by his own rectitude, for he is also bound within thatfour-caste system... [4-4-6]"
4-4-7,"There is none despising him, nor he despised any and for all the living beings he islike the Grandparent Brahma on earth... [4-4-7]"
4-4-8,"And he, King Dasharatha who performed rituals agniSToma and the like Vedic ritualswherein he donated liberally, and this one is his eldest son, and he is renowned among people bythe name of Rama... [4-4-8]"
4-4-9,"He is the protector of all beings and the follower of father's directives, he isthe eldest one among the sons of King Dasharatha... possessor of high virtues, qualities and royalfortune befitting to a king... but he is deprived of his kingdom, and came hither to dwell in theforests... nevertheless, followed by me...[4-4-9, 10]"
4-4-10,"With his wife Seetha following him, oh, highly fortunate Hanuma, thisself-controlled and highly resplendent Rama came to forests like the Sun followed by his consortPrabha, who vanishes when the day is abated..."
4-4-11,"With his wife Seetha following him, oh, highly fortunate Hanuma, thisself-controlled and highly resplendent Rama came to forests like sun with his dwindlingresplendence when the day is abated... [4-4-11]"
4-4-12,"I am the one who obtained servitude by the justness of this faithful andknowledgeable one, and his younger brother, by name I am named as Lakshmana... [4-4-12]"
4-4-13,"He who aspires to keep up the well-being of all the beings, and he who is meritedfor all comforts and respectability is now devoid of his prosperity and predisposed to forestdwelling... such as he is, his wife is abducted by a guise changing demon in a lonely place, ofwhom we know not... we know not which demon stole his wife... [4-4-13, 14]"
4-4-14,"One named Danu, son of Diti, who acquired demon-hood by curse had said thatSugreeva, the chief of monkeys, is a capable one, and he even said, that great valorous Sugreevacan know about the abductor of your wife..."" saying thus that Danu is released from the curse ofhis demon-hood, moved skyward and went away to heavens while becoming self-luminous... [4-4-15,16]"
4-4-15,"All this is informed to you, as it is as you have asked..Myself and Rama, we nowhave our recourse to Sugreeva alone... [4-4-17]"
4-4-16,"He who gave away riches in charity, who obtained unequalled renown and who himselfwas the lord of this world earlier, now accepts the lordship of Sugreeva... [4-4-18]"
4-4-17,"Who was a patron of virtue and who himself was a shelterer, to whom Seetha is thedaughter-in-law, such a shelterer's son Rama is now taking shelter under Sugreeva... [4-4-19]"
4-4-18,"He who is a virtuous one and protector of all the world, and who is the only refugefor all in earlier times... such a Raaghava, my mentor, is now seeking refuge with Sugreeva...[4-4-20]"
4-4-19,"By whose beneficence all these people are always delighted, he that Rama is nowseeking benefaction from the lord of monkeys... [4-4-21]"
4-4-20,"By which kingDasharatha, are all the kings with all possible good attributes arealways, and at all the times were esteemed to be safeguarded as defensible kings, such king'seldest son Rama, renowned in all the three worlds for his own sheltering the needy, has now takenshelter under monkeys lord Sugreeva... [4-4-22, 23]"
4-4-21,"One who is rebuffed by sadness, and even agonised by it had already sought refuge,hence it is apt of Sugreeva to do favour in Rama's respect along with other vanara commanders...Lakshmana said thus to Hanuma. [4-4-24]"
4-4-22,"To Lakshmana, who is telling that piteously with tears falling out, the eminentlylettered Hanumaan said this in his return. [4-4-25]"
4-4-23,"Intellectuals of your kind, who have conquered anger and senses are to be seen bythe chief of monkeys Sugreeva, for your advent is godsend... [4-4-26]"
4-4-24,"He who is made as an enemy, very muchinsulted, and abrogated from kingdom by hisown brother Vali, that Sugreeva is roaming about forests fearing him alone, his own brother Vali...[4-4-27]"
4-4-25,"He that son of Sun, Sugreeva, will render help to you two, joining forces of ourlike Vanara-s in searching Seetha... [4-4-28]"
4-4-26,"Thus Hanuman on speaking melodious words with politeness, also said to Raghava as,""good, we may now approach Sugreeva...."" [4-4-29]"
4-4-27,"Hanuma when said thus virtuous Lakshmana adored him customarily in the way befittingto an envoy, and spoke this to Rama... [4-4-30]"
4-4-28,"Raghava, as to how this monkey seems to be happy in meeting us, by way of hisnarration, and he too neared us as an aspirant of some deed to be performed by us, hence joiningthem seems to fulfil your mission... [4-4-31]"
4-4-29,"He is talking with a lucid expression and pleasing facial tinge by which he seemsto be gladdened at his heart... needless is telling untruths to such a valiant son of Air-god,Hanuma, isn't it! So said Laskhmana to Rama [4-4-32]"
4-4-30,"Then he that very intelligent son of Air-god Hanuma, took those two valorousRaghava-s to go to the king of monkeys Sugreeva. [4-4-33]"
4-4-31,"On discarding the ascetic's semblance that estimable monkey Hanuma obtained his ownmonkey's form, and mounting those two valiant ones onto his back he proceeded towards Sugreeva.[4-4-34]"
4-4-32,"Hanuma, the extensively renowned heroic son of Air-god with pious mind and highlyaudacious nature, is then gladdened like the one whose difficult deed is just accomplished, thus hegladly travelled to that mountain where Sugreeva is abiding, along with Rama and Lakshmana.[4-4-35]"
4-5-1,"Hanuma on going from Mt. Rishyamuka to Mt. Malaya, has reported to the king of monkeys Sugreeva, about the two valiant Raghava-s. [4-5-1]"
4-5-2,"Oh! great discerner Sugreeva, this is Rama... oh, stubbornly valiant Sugreeva, this virtuously valiant Rama arrived along with his brother Lakshmana... [4-5-2]"
4-5-3,"Rama is the son of king Dasharatha, one born in Ikshvaku dynasty, an adept one in virtue and thus an adherent of his father&#39;s orders... [4-5-3]"
4-5-4,"By whom the ritual fire is well worshipped in Vedic rituals like rajasuuya, ashvametha, and thus cows in hundreds and thousands are donated in those rituals, by whom this earth is ruled devoutly and truthful to his word, such Dasharatha&#39;s son is this Rama, who has to come to forests owing to a woman... [4-5-4, 5]"
4-5-5,"Ravana stole the wife of this principled one and great soul Rama when dwelling in forests, such as he is, he came seeking your refuge... [4-5-6]"
4-5-6,"These two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, are interested to make friendship with you... thus you receive these two and worship them, for they are most venerable ones... Hanuma thus advised Sugreeva. [4-5-7]"
4-5-7,"On hearing Hanuma&#39;s words Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys has become presentable and gladly spoke to Rama. [4-5-8]"
4-5-8,"You are a trained one in treading righteous path, best by your scruples, and a kindlier one to all, so said Air-god&#39;s son Hanuma to me about your attributes, in subtlety... [4-5-9]"
4-5-9,"Therefor oh, lord, you wish to make friendship with a monkey like me, thereby this is an honour and a best achievement to me alone... [4-5-10]"
4-5-10,"If you aspire my friendship here I extend my arm, take this hand of mine into yours, thus let the convention be stably made fast... Thus Sugreeva proffered friendship to Rama. [4-5-11]"
4-5-11,"Rama is gladdened at heart on listening all those words well said by Sugreeva, and then clutched Sugreeva&#39;s hand in his, and ardently abiding by the vow of friendship he embraced Sugreeva, grippingly and happily. [4-5-12, 13a]"
4-5-12,"Then the destroyer of enemies Hanuma discarding the guise of ascetic assumed his original monkey form, and on producing fire with two sticks then made it to glow. decorated, worshipped with flowers, then gladly and devoutly placed that fire in between Rama and Sugreeva. [4-5-13b,14,15a]"
4-5-13,"Then those two performed circumambulations to that well glowing ritual fire, and thus, Rama and Sugreeva entered into the pact of friendship. [4-5-15, 16a]"
4-5-14,"And then gladdened at heart are those two, that monkey and Raghava, gazed enough at each other eye-to-eye, but their hearts did not derive any fraternal satisfaction. [4-5-16b, 17a]"
4-5-15,"Sugreeva rejoicingly said to Raghava, you are the amiable friend of mine, henceforth our mirth or miseries are same for us... [4-5-17b, 18a]"
4-5-16,"And then Sugreeva snapped off and spread a fully flowered tree-branch of sala tree with many leaves, and sat on it along with Rama. [4-5-18b, 19a]"
4-5-17,"Then Hanuma the son of Air, gladly gave a well-flowered branch of sandalwood tree to Lakshmana... [4-5-19b, 20a]"
4-5-18,"Then that delighted Sugreeva with his sweet words, and with his eyes quavering in happiness, replied Rama softly. [4-5-20b, 21a]"
4-5-19,"Rama, I am ridiculed, stolen is my wife, I move here about in these forests with dread and fear haunting me... I took refuge in this impenetrable forest... [4-5-21b, 22a]"
4-5-20,"Oh, Raghava, my brother denounced me, he even made me an enemy of his, such as I am I am living in these forests with scare and fear, and with dismayed vitality... [4-5-22b, 23a]"
4-5-21,"Oh, highly fortunate Rama, affirm fearlessness to me from Vali by who I am highly intimidated, and as to how there will be fearlessness to me from him, it will be apt of you to accomplish that, that way... [4-5-23b, 24a]"
4-5-22,"When thus said, that resplendent and righteous one being the patron of virtue Rama replied Sugreeva, as though laughing off. [4-5-24b, 25a]"
4-5-23,"A friend is the resultant factor of helpfulness... that I know... oh, great monkey I intend eliminate that Vali, the abductor of your wife... [4-5-2b, 26a5]"
4-5-24,"Unfailing are these arrows of mine, scorchers like sun, sharp ones tied with eagle feathers, similar to Indra&#39;s Thunderbolts, sharp are their point and straight is their egress, similar to enraged snakes, and these arrows of mine will be speeded up to fall on that vicious Vali... [4-5-26b, 27, 28a]"
4-5-25,"You will see now itself the falling of Vali like a splintered mountain onto ground, when completely ruined by these cruel arrows that are similar to venomous snakes... Thus Rama inculcated confidence in Sugreeva. [4-5-28b, 29a]"
4-5-26,"On hearing Raghava&#39;s words that are appeasing for his self, Sugreeva is very completely satisfied and said this fine sentence. [4-5-29b, c]"
4-5-27,"By your grace, oh, lion among men, let me regain my wife and kingdom too... oh, god of humans, as to how he does not suffer me again, thus you may please make happen... let not my elder brother turned as an enemy of mine suffer me again... [4-5-30]"
4-5-28,"During the friendly conversation of Rama and Sugreeva, the left eyes of Seetha, Vali and Ravana that bear similitude with lotuses, golden orbs, and fireballs respectively have fluttered equally. [4-5-31]"
4-6-1,"Then Sugreeva who is gladdened again spoke to Rama of Raghu's dynasty, ""My bestminister and this servant of yours Hanuma informed me of the reason for which you have come touninhabited forests along with your brother Lakshmana, and that while living in the forest, andwhen you and this courageous Lakshmana are not her alongside a demon stole your wife Maithili, thedaughter of Janaka, wailing as she was. [4-6-3]"
4-6-2,"And he also said about that arch demon's killing an eagle named Jatayu on waitingfor an opportunity, and his causing an agony in you by way of separating your wife. [4-6-4]"
4-6-3,"Before long you will get rid off your agony caused by the separation of wife, for Iwill fetch her very soon, like the retrieval Vedic Scriptures. [4-6-5]"
4-6-4,"Oh! Enemy destroyer, Rama, I will fetch your wife to give her to you whether she isin netherworlds or even in empyrean worlds. [4-6-6]"
4-6-5,"You may know that this word of mine is definite oh, Raghava. Your wife is as goodas an indigestible foodstuff made with poison, indigestive even to Indra, put together with allgods and demons. [4-6-7, 8a]"
4-6-6,"Give-up your lamentation, oh, great-shouldered one, for I will bring back that ladyfor you. And by inference I know her... undoubtedly I have seen Maithilee while that demon withcruel deeds was abducting her... then she was crying piteously calling 'Rama, Rama...' and alsocalling 'Lakshmana...' and she was writhing in the flanks of Ravana like the wife of serpent'slord... [4-6-8b, 9, 10]"
4-6-7,"Myself being the fifth one on the cliff of the mountain, on seeing me she droppedthe upper cloth of her sari along with auspicious jewellery. [4-6-11]"
4-6-8,"We took those jewellery items and stored them, Raaghava... I will get them and itwill be apt of you to identify them... thus said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-6-12]"
4-6-9,"Then Rama said to that pleasant talker Sugreeva, ""Get them quickly, my friend, whatfor you are delaying."" [4-6-13]"
4-6-10,"Thus said Sugreeva then entered the cavernous cave of that mountain quickly, tofulfil the yearning of Raghava. [4-6-14]"
4-6-11,"On taking and bringing the parcel of that upper cloth with the auspicious jewellery,""This, you see..."" saying thus that monkey started to show them to Rama. [4-6-15]"
4-6-12,"Then on taking that cloth and also the auspicious jewellery, Rama became like mistfilled moon with overfilling tears. [4-6-16]"
4-6-13,"But he who is blemished by tears that outpoured in all his friendship with Seetha,leaving off his courage fell on the ground wailing, 'oh, dear... oh, dear...' [4-6-17]"
4-6-14,"The more he hugged those best decorative ornaments close to his heart, the more hehissed like a wrathful serpent in a snake pit. [4-6-18]"
4-6-15,"With the unending rush of tears he saw Lakshmana at his side and started to wailpiteously. [4-6-19]"
4-6-16,"Lakshmana, see this upper cloth and these ornaments too of Vaidehi, shed from herbody and dropped onto the ground while she is being abducted. [4-6-20]"
4-6-17,"Seetha must have definitely dropped these ornaments onto pastureland, for theyappear to be in their original shape, indeed. So said Rama to Lakshmana. [4-6-21]"
4-6-18,"When Rama thus said Lakshmana said this, ""I know not the bracelets and I know notthe earrings But because I always salute her feet I know these anklets well...[4-6-22]"
4-6-19," Then Rama sadly asked to Sugreeva, tell me Sugreeva, towards which country thatferocious looking demon abducted my dear one dearest than my lives, as spotted by you...[4-6-23]"
4-6-20,"For the sake of which demon I wish to eliminate whole of the demons, thattroublemaker of mine, where does he live, either... [4-6-25]"
4-6-21,"By whom Maithili is abducted and thus caused indignation in me, he has opened upthe doors of his death suicidally. [4-6-26]"
4-6-22," Oh, king of the fly-jumpers, tell me which demon forcibly stole her, my dearestone than all, by molesting her in the forest, tell me about that enemy of mine, for sure I willlead him to the fore of Death today itself... [4-6-27]"
4-7-1,"Thus said by Rama in agony that monkey Sugreeva with his palms adjoined, and withtears rolling in eyes and also voice trembling with tears said this to Rama. [4-7-1]"
4-7-2,"Unfamiliar is the residence, or capability, or valour, or lineage of that sinningdemon from a sinister dynasty, in any wise... [4-7-2]"
4-7-3,"Truthfully I am promising you, oh, enemy destroyer, as to how you will get backMaithili therefor I strive to make effort, let anguish be discarded... [4-7-3]"
4-7-4,"As to how you will satisfy yourself on killing Ravana along with his henchmen, andas to how to you pride yourself thereby, I will make it happen in that way in no longer a time...[4-7-4]"
4-7-5,"Enough is this clinging on to despair, recollect your inherent courage, and it isunseemly for persons of your sort to have this kind of mental ineptness... [4-7-5]"
4-7-6,"Upon me too this yearning caused by the separation of wife has chanced, but I didnot despair this way, nor I have forsaken my courage... [4-7-6]"
4-7-7,"Though I am a primitive monkey I am not totally disheartened for the distancing ofwife, why tell about a great soul like you who are well read and courageous... [4-7-7]"
4-7-8,"It is apt of you to control trickling tears with courage, and equally it is inaptof you to discard the courage and propriety of self-controlled people... [4-7-8]"
4-7-9,"Either in a riddle, or in financial loss, or at the end of life, or in fear, acourageous one does not sink down, but indeed introspects in his own mind... [4-7-9]"
4-7-10,"Stupid is that man who always follows self-piteous sadness unable to controlhimself, and he drowns down in that melancholy like a overweighing ship in waters... [4-7-10]"
4-7-11,"Adjoined are my palms in this way beseeching you in friendship, kindly bear up yourself-esteem and you should not give any leeway to sadness... [4-7-11]"
4-7-12,"Those that delve deep into moroseness, to them there is no happiness, and theirbrilliance too dwindles, thus saddening is inapt on your part... [4-7-12]"
4-7-13,"One well-engulfed in sadness doubts even his life, oh, king of kings, leave offthat sadness and just hold on to courage...[4-7-13]"
4-7-14,"I am telling a benefiting and friendly thought, but not instructing you, should youregard my friendship then your saddening is inapt... [Thus said Sugreeva to Rama.] [4-7-14]"
4-7-15,"Sweetly solaced thus by that Sugreeva Rama dabbed his face with the edge of cloth,which is covered fully with tears. [4-7-15]"
4-7-16,"Lord Rama steadied himself in his own nature by the words of Sugreeva, and onembracing him Rama said this sentence to him. [4-7-16]"
4-7-17,"Sugreeva, a friendly obligation that which is to be done, a benefiting, befittingand a timely one too, is what you have performed with your friendly advise... [4-7-17]"
4-7-18,"Oh, friend, I steadied myself in my own nature when implored by you... it isimpossible to get this kind of friend, especially at these times... [4-7-18]"
4-7-19,"But, trying to search for Maithili and that furious, evil-minded demon Ravana, isyour endeavour... [4-7-19]"
4-7-20,"What is to done by me that be said in all believability, and all your endeavourwill reap like the crops planted during rainy season in good lands... [4-7-20]"
4-7-21,"What that is spoken by me is in my self-confidence but not in any self-conceit, oh,tigerly-monkey, deem them as doubtless facts... [4-7-21]"
4-7-22,"Untruth is not uttered by me earlier nor will be at anytime from now, and all thisI am promising you taking oath on that truthfulness alone.. [4-7-22]"
4-7-23,"Then on hearing the words of Rama Sugreeva along with his monkey ministers isgladdened, especially of Rama promise. [4-7-23]"
4-7-24,"Then those two, the man and the monkey, met in privacy and both discussed in amutually befitting manner about their pleasures and pains. [4-7-24]"
4-7-25,"On hearing the word of that intellectual, highly capable one and the best king amongkings, namely Rama, he that Sugreeva, the chief among the monkey heroes, thought at heart that hismanoeuvre to surpass his dominant brother Vali is accomplished. [4-7-25]"
4-8-1,"Sugreeva is gladdened and satisfied too by that sentence, and said this sentence toLakshmana's elder brother, Rama the valiant one. [4-8-1]"
4-8-2,"When you wth all kinds of endowment and good virtues are my friend, doubtlessly Iam worthy to be blessed by all gods in everyway. [4-8-2]"
4-8-3,"Oh, merited one, with your help it will be possible to achieve kingdom of gods, oh,lord, then why tell about one's own kingdom... [4-8-3]"
4-8-4,"He who has gained the one born in Raghava-s dynasty as friend, to which sacred firebore the witness, such a being like me is estimable among his relative, more so among hiskind-hearted friends... [4-8-4]"
4-8-5,"Even though I am a matching friend to you, that you will know soon, it will beinexpedient of myself to talk about my inherent capabilities. [4-8-5]"
4-8-6,"Great souls of your kind, whose hearts are purified like yours, oh, amiable Rama,their friendship and courage will generally be stable. [4-8-6]"
4-8-7,"Gentle souls will be knowing that silver or gold, or even prosperous ornaments arenot to be apportioned among themselves as this is mine and that is yours. [4-8-7]"
4-8-8,"May he be rich or poor, saddened or gladdened, flawless or flawed, a friend is theultimate recourse to any. [4-8-8]"
4-8-9,"On observing the course of friendship and knowing which is true friendship, thetrue friends do not hesitate to extend wealth, pleasure or even their own country for the sake offriendship. Sugreeva thus extolled Rama and his friendship. [4-8-9]"
4-8-10,"That is thus only, said Rama before Lakshmana, which Lakshmana is sagacious,resplendent and who vies with Indra, about what is said by Sugreeva, which Sugreeva is by nowsoft-natured in his looks, doffing off his jittery look. [4-8-10]"
4-8-11,"Then on seeing Rama standing there with greatly mighty Lakshmana, Sugreeva cast hissight with his bolting eyes around that forest. [4-8-11]"
4-8-12,"He that lord of monkeys Sugreeva has then seen a well flowered sala tree not far offfrom there, covered with some leaves and bedecked with honeybees. [4-8-12]"
4-8-13,"And Sugreeva broke off one branch of that sala tree that is with many leaves and awell charming one, and spreading it out for Rama, he sat on it with Raghava. [4-8-13]"
4-8-14,"On seeing those two sitting on a branch then Hanuma also broke a branch of sala treefor the modest Lakshmana and seated Lakshmana on it. [4-8-14]"
4-8-15,"Then to him, who by now is comfortably sitting on a flowery mat laid by the bestrewnflowers of sala trees on that best mountain like a quiet ocean, to such Rama who by his verypresence delights hearts, that gladsome Sugreeva said this in friendship with his gentle andgracious words that fluttered with happiness while he spoke. [4-8-15, 16]"
4-8-16,"My brother calumniated me and stole my wife, with his fear and my anguish hauntingme I am moving about this best mountain Rishyamuka. [4-8-17]"
4-8-17,"Affronted by my brother, oh, Raghava, I am made as his enemy, such as I am, I amliving on with a scared and dazed vitality far flung in fear. [4-8-18]"
4-8-18,"I am agonized by the fear from Vali, oh, protector of all the worlds, you protectme too for I am unprotected, and able are you to accord protection. Thus Sugreeva appealed toRama. [4-8-19]"
4-8-19,"Thus said by Sugreeva, the resplendent and virtuous Rama, the patron ofrighteousness replied Sugreeva as though laughing off the task. [4-8-20]"
4-8-20,"Helping is the fruit of friendship while harming is enemy's trait, hence I wish tokill him today only, that abductor of your wife... Rama continued thus. [4-8-21]"
4-8-21,"These are my arrows winged from pinion of the hern, oh, highly fortunate Sugreeva,these that are decorated in gold sparkle sharply like the Thunderbolts of Indra, and they arebegotten from the reed forest of Kartikeya, ends tied with eagles feathers for fins, smooth aretheir nodes, sharp are their tips that pierce sharply, and these will be like enraged snakes.[4-8-22, 23]"
4-8-22,"You may see your malicious and intimidating brother, someone denotative by nameVali, eradicated with these very arrows and splintered down like a mountain. Rama said so toSugreeva. [4-8-24]"
4-8-23,"On hearing Raghava's words, the lord of monkey-force Sugreeva attained muchhappiness and said, 'good, good...' [4-8-25]"
4-8-24,"Rama, I am confounded in sadness, and for those lamenting sadly you are the onlyrecourse, and because you have befriended me I am opening up my woes before you. [4-8-26]"
4-8-25,"By extending a helping hand and befriending me while sacred fire bore witness, youhave indeed become my dearest friend on par with my life, and hence I take promise on truth tobroach. [4-8-27]"
4-8-26,"By befriending you I am able to say clearly about my internal sorrow without anyhitches and hold-ups, which is always rending my heart... So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-8-28]"
4-8-27,"Sugreeva said this much sentence with tears abusing his eyes and his voice is unabletalk aloud since it is equally abused by tears. [4-8-29]"
4-8-28,"Sugreeva courageously controlled the sudden haste of tears that came up hastily andsuddenly like a river in the presence of Rama. [4-8-30]"
4-8-29,"He that bright Sugreeva controlled those tears, and on wiping his fortunate eyes,but sighing heavily he again started to speak this sentence to Raghava. [4-8-31]"
4-8-30,"Earlier he that forceful Vali deposed me from my kingdom, oh Rama, and speakingharsh words he even banished me. [4-8-32]"
4-8-31,"My wife who is loftier than my lives is stolen by him, and those that are mysympathisers they are also captivated and imprisoned by him. [4-8-33]"
4-8-32,"He that very evil minded one tried many times to annihilate me, and Raghava, Ikilled those combatants monkeys that are deployed by Vali to kill me. [4-8-34]"
4-8-33,"With the same doubt I did not even near you when I saw you... in fear everythingwill be fearsome, isn't it... [4-8-35]"
4-8-34,"Though I am engulfed in tribulations I still bear my lives even today due to theseimportant monkeys like Hanuma and others, who are the only helping hands of mine. [4-8-36]"
4-8-35,"These are the friendly monkeys guarding me all over, while I go they go along withme, and if I were to stay they too will stay. [4-8-37]"
4-8-36,"Rama, this is briefly my sad-story and why tell this very broadly to you as itwould be too tedious... my elder brother Vali is a renowned one for his intrepidity, and he thatVali alone is my enemy. [4-8-38]"
4-8-37,"His end ends my distress and my later life and quietude are subjected to hisdestruction. [4-8-39]"
4-8-38,"Grief stricken such as I am, I have submitted as to how my misery ends, whether oneis gladdened or saddened he has recourse only to his friend. So said Sugreeva to Rama.[4-8-40]"
4-8-39,"Hearing all that is spoken by Sugreeva, Rama asked, ""What for chanced the enmity? Iam interested to listen, in its reality...[4-8-41]"
4-8-40,"On knowing the cause of your enmity, oh, monkey, and after a proper thought, anddeciding upon the strength and weakness of the cause of enmity, or of the enmity itself, I will dothe needful very easily. [4-8-42]"
4-8-41,"On hearing that you are insulted my intense anger that can flutter my heartbeat isintensifying like the intensifying speed of waters in rainy reason. [4-8-43]"
4-8-42,"Be glad to say in belief, Sugreeva, before I take aim with my bow, and even beforeI release the arrow, and even before silencing your enemy. Rama assured Sugreeva in this way.[4-8-44]"
4-8-43,"Thus said by the great souled Rama, Sugreeva is very much rejoiced along with fourof vanara-s available in his attendance. [4-8-45]"
4-8-44,"Then with a pleased countenance Sugreeva started to tell Rama about the cause of theenmity, it all it truthfulness. [4-8-46]"
4-9-1,"Oh, great enemy destroyer Rama, my elder brother Vali is a very dear one to ourfather, and even for me too he was so, earlier. [4-9-1]"
4-9-2,"After the demise of our father all the ministers have glorified him immensely andmade him the king of all the monkeys as he is the elder. [4-9-2]"
4-9-3,"While he was ruling the great kingdom of my father and forefathers, I have alwaysbowed down to him like a servant and stood by him. [4-9-3]"
4-9-4,"There was a fierce demon named Maayaavi, the elder brother of Dundubhi and the sonof one demon named Maya. There was a great enmity between this Maayaavi and Vali owing to somefemale. [4-9-4]"
4-9-5,"He that Maayaavi arrived at the doors of Kishkindha in a night when the people aresleeping, and blared very much inviting Vali for a fight. [4-9-5]"
4-9-6,"Then my brother who was also sleeping well, on hearing that bellowing in aclamouring voice, did not tolerate and came out speedily. [4-9-6]"
4-9-7,"Though the females and myself bowed reverently to prevent Vali, he came out ofpalace in all his anger to kill that great demon. [4-9-7]"
4-9-8,"But Vali spurned all of us away and forged ahead, and then I also have started to goalong with Vali in all my predisposition. [4-9-8]"
4-9-9,"A great fear was induced in that demon on seeing my brother and me too coming from adistance, and then he quickly ran away. [4-9-9]"
4-9-10,"While he is running away in fear we quickly followed him on a path that is barelylit by moonlight of the moon who is just coming up. [4-9-10]"
4-9-11,"That demon speedily entered an un-enterable cavity under the ground, covered withgrass, and we too having reached there speedily stood at the aperture of that cavity for a while.[4-9-11]"
4-9-12,"Then Vali has gone into the enfoldment of fury on observing the entry of that demoninto the hole, whereby his senses felt outraged, and he said this sentence to me. [4-9-12]"
4-9-13,"Then Vali said to me, ""Now you stay here on the alert, Sugreeva, at the entrance ofthis hole till I return on destroying the enemy in a fight on my entering this hole...""[4-9-13]"
4-9-14,"On hearing those words I requested him to allow me too to come in to the hole, buthe being the great tormentor of his enemies disallowed it, and he made me to swear on his feet andentered that hole. [4-9-15]"
4-9-15,"Well over a year is over after his entering into that cleavage, and to me too whostayed at the entrance of the cleavage that much time had passed away. [4-9-15]"
4-9-16,"I thought I lost him for my brother is unseen, and in all fondness towards him mymind started to doubt about some harm might have befallen on him. [4-9-16]"
4-9-17,"After a long time blood with foam gushed out that hole, and on seeing it I wasdeeply saddened. [4-9-17]"
4-9-18,"Sounds of screaming demon came to my ear, but the screeches of my brother who isinvolved in fight are unheard, in the least. [4-9-18]"
4-9-19,"Oh, friend, Rama... I have surmised and concluded in mind by the indications that mybrother is finished, and covered the cavity's opening with a mountain similar boulder, andperformed water oblations to my deceased brother with saddening pain, and then returned toKishkindha. But the ministers have persuaded and heard from me the actual happening though I wasconcealing it. [4-9-19, 20]"
4-9-20,"Then duly summoned by all of those ministers I was crowned, and while I was rulingthe kingdom judiciously, oh, Raghava, that semi-human Vali returned on killing that demoniac enemy.[4-9-21, 22a]"
4-9-21,"But on seeing me crowned his eyes were reddened in anger, and he arrested all myministers as he spoke rudely. [4-9-22b, 23a]"
4-9-22,"And oh, Raghava, though I was capable enough to counter him, my reason wascontrolled by my esteem to brotherhood, and I was indisposed to commit that sin of defyingbrotherhood. [4-9-23b, 24a]"
4-9-23,"He that brother of mine entered the capital thus on destroying the enemy, and Ihailed him as usual while respecting that audacious soul, but his inner self is unsatisfied and Iremained unblest. [4-9-24b, 25]"
4-9-24,"Oh, lord Rama, though I bowed with the crown touching his feet, he that rancorousVali showed no quarter towards me."" So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-9-25]"
4-10-1,"Then desiring both of our well-being I have begged of my brother who is envelopedin anger and behaving capriciously. [4-10-1]"
4-10-2,"Oh, orphan's, delight Rama, I addressed him like this, Luckily you have eliminatedthe enemy and returned safely, and to an orphaned one like me you alone are the protector.[4-10-2]"
4-10-3,"Let this regal umbrella unfolded like a full moon, with its many of its spikes, andwith accompanying fur-fans may please be accepted while I hold it for you. [4-10-3]"
4-10-4,"Saddened I was after staying at the entrance of the cave for one year, oh, king,and on seeing the blood that started to flow from out the cave in the entrance my heart is engulfedin sadness and my senses perturbed very much, and then covering that cave's entrance with ahilltop, and departing from that country, I re-entered Kishkindha. [4-10-4, 5, 6a]"
4-10-5,"On seeing me returning with grief, the citizens and ministers alike crowned me, butthat is not at my desire, therefore it is apt of you pardon me. [4-10-6b, 7a]"
4-10-6,"As an estimable one you alone are the king, and I will be as I was, andestablishing me in kingship is owing to your unavailability, but the capital with citizens andministers is kept up without thorniness. [4-10-7b, 8]"
4-10-7,"Oh, gentle one, I am now returning this custodial kingdom to you, oh, enemyeliminator, you need not be hostile towards me. [4-10-9]"
4-10-8,"I beg you with my bowed head and with my prayerful palm-fold, the ministers and thecity dwellers have collectively and forcibly nominated me to the kingship, only to keep thekingless kingdom under control. [4-10-10, 11a]"
4-10-9,"While I was speaking that politely he threatened me and indeed used many expletivesstarting from 'fie, fie, upon you.' and the like. [4-10-11b, 12a]"
4-10-10,"And summoning people and venerable ministers he hurled very abusive words at meamong friends. [4-10-12b, 13a]"
4-10-11,"You all are aware that earlier the gigantic and rancorous demon Maayaavi invited medesiring a duel in that night. [4-10-13b, 14a]"
4-10-12,"On hearing his call for a duel I went out of the royal palace, and this veryhazardous brother of mine quickly followed me. [4-10-14b, 15a]"
4-10-13,"And that formidable demon Maayaavi ran away as he was fraught with fear on seeingme with a second one at my side, and he speedily entered a great cavity of earth on seeing us twonearly reaching him. [4-10-15b, 16]"
4-10-14,"On knowing the demon's entry into that great precarious cavity, I said to this one,this cruel looking brother of mine. [4-10-17]"
4-10-15,"My power will not let me return from here to the capital without killing thatdemon, hence you wait at this cavity's entrance, till I kill that demon and come out of the cavity.[4-10-18]"
4-10-16,"Believing that he stayed at the entrance of the cavity I entered that impenetrablecavity, and then in searching for that demon there one year elapsed. [4-10-19]"
4-10-17,"I have seen that terrified enemy of mine effortlessly, and I killed him immediatelyalong with all of his relatives. [4-10-20]"
4-10-18,"That cavity has become impassable, since it is fully filled with the gushes ofblood emanating from the mouth of that demon who fell yelling onto ground. [4-10-21]"
4-10-19,"On my killing that invading enemy easily, I could not see any exit from that cavityas its mouth was closed. [4-10-22]"
4-10-20,"Wherefore I did not get a reply though I repeatedly shouted, 'Sugreeva, oh,Sugreeva.' thereby I was very saddened. [4-10-23]"
4-10-21,"With my foot I pounded and smashed that lidded hilltop, and from there I exitedthat way and arrived here. [4-10-24]"
4-10-22,"As such this cruel fantasist of kingdom trammelled me in there forgetting theclannishness. So said Vali to all the courtiers. [4-10-25]"
4-10-23,"On saying thus that monkey ruthlessly banished me, then and there in the courtitself, who am with a single clothing on my body. [4-10-26]"
4-10-24,"Thus he threw me away and even stole my wife, oh, Rama, and owing to his fear aloneI roamed all over the earth with its forests and oceans. [4-10-27]"
4-10-25,"I who am saddened by stealing my wife have entered this safest mountain Rishyamuka,which is impenetrable for Vali by another reason. [4-10-28]"
4-10-26,"All this notable account of enmity is reported to you, oh, Raghava, and you mayexamine the dire straits befallen on me at no fault of mine. [4-10-29]"
4-10-27,"Oh, Rama, the fear-remover of all the worlds, it is apt of you to bestow meinvulnerability from the fear of Vali, and oh, valiant one, as well as to rein him in. Sugreevarequested Rama thus. [4-10-30]"
4-10-28,"When he is requested thus by Sugreeva, that virtuous and resplendent Rama started totell Sugreeva, the words that abide by virtue, as though trivializing the task on hand.[4-10-31]"
4-10-29,"Admirable and sun-like burners are these arrows of mine that are now mingled withmy wrath, and they are bound fall on that evil minded Vali. [4-10-32]"
4-10-30,"He that stealer of your wife, that evil-minded abuser of history lives as long as Idescry. [4-10-33]"
4-10-31,"By my experience I see how you are deluged in a sea of sadness, but I will make youto get over that sea, and you will definitely regain abundantly whatever you lost. Rama assuredSugreeva thus. [4-10-34]"
4-10-32,"Hearing that sentence of Rama, which is enhancing happiness and self-esteem,Sugreeva is very gladdened and further said this great sentence. [4-10-35]"
4-11-1,"Sugreeva started to adore and extol Raghava on hearing the words of Rama that areinculcating happiness and pride. [4-11-1]"
4-11-2,"It is doubtless that you will burn down everything when you are angry, like theblazing sun at the end of era, with these arrows of yours that are highly blazing, incisive andinvaders on stealthy places. Thus Sugreeva started extolling Rama. [4-11-2]"
4-11-3,"That which is impetuousness of Vali, that which is his bravery and courageousnessare there, they may be listened from me single-mindedly, and later you impose that which need beimposed. [4-11-3]"
4-11-4,"Before the dawn of sun Vali unweariedly strides from western ocean to eastern, andeven from southern to northern for offering water oblations to the rising sun. [4-11-4]"
4-11-5,"Ascending the heights of mountains and even rending their greatest peaks, thatmighty one volleys them upwards and in turn catches them, as though they are play balls.[4-11-5]"
4-11-6,"As a show his strength Vali used to personally fell many sturdy trees of diverseorigin by his might. [4-11-6]"
4-11-7,"One named Dundubhi was there in the form of a buffalo, whose size shone forth likeMt. Kailash and who bears the strength of a thousand elephants. Thus Sugreeva started tellingDundubhi's episode to Rama. [4-11-7]"
4-11-8,"He that evil-minded and colossal bodied Dundubhi was bemused by the vanity of hisown vigour, and by the boon bestowed oo him, and once he went to the lord of rivers, namely theOcean. [4-11-8]"
4-11-9,"Deriding the garner of weaves and gems he said to that vastly ocean give me afight"" [4-11-9]"
4-11-10,"Then, oh, Rama, that virtue-minded and very powerful ocean rose up from his tabularposition to heights, and spoke these words to that demon Dundubhi who is driven to doom by his owntime. [4-11-10]"
4-11-11,"I am not capable to give you a fight, oh, war-expert, but I will name him who cangive you a fight, listen. So said ocean to the demon. [4-11-11]"
4-11-12,"A sublime shelter for sages and the father-in-law of Shankara is there in greatforests, well-know by the name Himavan, the king of mountains, and he embodies great cascades,cataracts, and caves, and he alone is capable to accord a matchless happiness to you in the form ofa fight. So said ocean to Dundubhi. [4-11-12, 13]"
4-11-13,"Fathoming that ocean to be scared of him that noted demon Dundubhi arrived at theforests of Himavan like an arrow darted from bow, and that Dundubhi started to blare discordantlyand toss the rock-faces of that mountain that are like white elephants in their figuration,severally. [4-11-14, 15]"
4-11-14,"Then he who is like a silver cloud in his figuration, a gentle and delightful onein his appearance, that Himavan spoke these words to the demon staying on his own cliff.[4-11-16]"
4-11-15,"It is inapt of you to annoy me, oh, virtuous Dundubhi, I am just a shelterer ofsages, and an unskilled one in fights. So said Himavan to Dundubhi. [4-11-17]"
4-11-16,"On hearing the words of that modest king of mountains Dundubhi's uyes are bloodshotand he said this sentence. [4-11-18]"
4-11-17,"Whether you are incapable to fight with me, or not venturing me as you are scaredof me is not my concern, but tell me who can really give me a very combative fight,. [4-11-19]"
4-11-18,"On hearing Dundubhi's arrogant words that honest Himavan being an expert insentence-making, had to say angry words to that fierce demon that were never uttered by himearlier. [4-11-20]"
4-11-19,"Oh, war-expert Dundubhi, Indra's son is there, a brave and glorious one by nameVali, and he is now presiding over the matchlessly pompous city Kishkindha. [4-11-21]"
4-11-20,"He is a highly intelligent one and a war-expert too, and he is the capable one togive you a duel, like Indra to Namuchi. [4-11-22]"
4-11-21,"Approach him promptly if you desire a fight now, and he is an intrepid one who willalways be in the manoeuvres of war, and indeed none can assail him. Thus said Himavan to thatdemon Dundubhi. [4-11-23]"
4-11-22,"Then on hearing Himavan's words he that Dundubhi is convulsed in anger andproceeded to Vali's city Kishkindha.. [4-11-24]"
4-11-23,"That great mighty demon Dundubhi wearing the look of a buffalo with sharp horns wasawe-inspiring, and like the arrival of a massive dark cloud in rainy season full with water on theedge of firmament, he arrived at the gateway of Kishkindha and bellowed clamorously like a war-drumas though to quake the earth. [4-11-25, 26]"
4-11-24,"He bellowed uprooting trees that are rooted nearby, scooping the earth with hooves,and insolently goring the gateway with horns like a goring elephant. [4-11-27]"
4-11-25,"Vali who by then went into his palace chambers became intolerant to hear that noiseand fell out from there along with ladies, like the moon with stars. [4-11-28]"
4-11-26,"Vali being the lord of monkeys, and of all the other forest-dwellers as well, spokea clearly worded brief sentence to Dundubhi. [4-11-29]"
4-11-27,"Oh, Dundubhi, impeding the gateway of this city what for you are bellowing, I knowyou, oh, might one, save your lives. Vali cautioned that demon that way. [4-11-30]"
4-11-28,"On hearing that sentence of Vali, the tactful lord of monkeys, Dundubhi said thissentence with his eyes bloodshot in anger. Thus Sugreeva continued his narration to Rama.[4-11-31]"
4-11-29,"It is inapt of you to speak words in the vicinity of ladies, oh, valiant Vali, giveme a duel now and then I can appreciate your might. [4-11-32]"
4-11-30,"Otherwise I bear up my rage for this night, oh, monkey, you may unrestrainedlydelight yourself till morning in your voluptuous gratifications, for you are now surrounded by yourladies. [4-11-33]"
4-11-31,"Also embrace all the monkeys and bequeath endowments to them, and you may bid adieuto all the good-hearted people of yours for you are the king of all the tree-branch animals, as youmay not see them later. [4-11-34]"
4-11-32,"Let Kishkindha city be seen clearly by you as last sight, and keep someoneequalling you as in charge of city, and also rejoice with the females till sunrise as there is notomorrow to you. [4-11-35]"
4-11-33,"He who kills a drunken one, unvigilant one, defeated one, or one without weapons,or an atrophied one, he get the sin of foeticide in the world, and your present state is suchlike.Dundubhi incited Vali in this way. [4-11-36]"
4-11-34,"Then Vali laughed that demon off, discharged all the females namely Tara andothers, and then he spoke to that stupid lord of demons in anger. [4-11-37]"
4-11-35,"Don't surmise that I am drunk, and should you be unafraid of a fight, regard thisdrunkenness of mine as the toast of a gallant fighter in this deadly fight. Vali said so toDundubhi. [4-11-38]"
4-11-36,"Saying that way to that Dundubhi that highly enraged Vali heaved up the goldenchest-pendant around his neck on to his chest, which was given by his father Mahendra, and stoodfirm for fight. [4-11-39]"
4-11-37,"Then that elephantine monkey Vali took that mountain-similar Dundubhi by horns, andbooming highly he whirled and bumped him onto ground. [4-11-40]"
4-11-38,"Vali while blaring highly with great sound repeatedly whirled him and thrown ontoground, and while Dundubhi was hurled and thrown to ground, blood gushed out of his two ears.[4-11-41]"
4-11-39,"There occurred a gruesome fight among those two, Dundubhi and Vali, who by theirfury are impetuous and who aspired victory over the other. [4-11-42]"
4-11-40,"Then Vali who is similar to Indra in his fortitude fought with him with his fists,knees and feet, and like that with boulders and trees. [4-11-43]"
4-11-41,"While each is assaulting the other in that fight between that monkey and demon,that demon is impaired and Indra's son Vali toughened. [4-11-44]"
4-11-42,"In that life-taking fight when Dundubhi is lifted up and flung to ground, he iscompletely pounded out. [4-11-45]"
4-11-43,"While he is felled down much blood is flown out from the vent-holes of his body,nine of them, ears, nose, eyes etc., and on his falling that mighty one Dundubhi attained thefifth-state. [4-11-46]"
4-11-44,"Then the hastiest Vali swayed that dead and inanimate demon with both of his handsand hurled him a yojana distance in a single flick. [4-11-47]"
4-11-45,"And while he is thrown that hastily blood drops oozed from his mouth, and flung byair they fell in the hermitage of sage Matanga. [4-11-48]"
4-11-46,"On seeing the blood drops fallen there, oh Rama, that sage is enraged and thought,'who is he indeed, who dropped the blood...' Thus Sugreeva narrated to Rama. [4-11-49]"
4-11-47," 'By which evil-spirited one I am abruptly touched with blood? Who is thatevil-minded one? Who is that malevolent, disobedient and a reckless one?' Thus the sage Matangapondered. [4-11-50]"
4-11-48,"Thinking thus and coming out of hermitage that celebrated sage has seen themountainous buffalo fallen on ground lifelessly. [4-11-51]"
4-11-49,"On knowing by his ascetic power that this deed is done by the monkey, he released agreat curse on him who tossed the cadaver of buffalo. [4-11-52]"
4-11-50,"Untreadable is this sheltering wood of mine to him who has stained it with squirtsof blood, and if he enters this place peradventure, fatality occurs on him. [4-11-53]"
4-11-51,"By his hurling the demon's body these trees are also completely destroyed, hence heought not set his foot in a distance of one full yojana around this hermitage, and if thatevil-minded one places his foot then he evidently does not exist. [4-11-54, 55a]"
4-11-52,"And some of his friends that are dependent on my woods shall not live here and theymay depart on hearing my words and solace themselves with my words. [4-11-55b, 56a]"
4-11-53,"This forest of mine is always protected like my own son, and if the monkeys of Valiwish to stay behind in this forest alone for further destruction of leaves or sprouts, or even forthe non-existence of fruits and tubers of this forest, defiantly they too will be cursed.[4-11-57]"
4-11-54,"And today is the day of limit and the monkey whom I will see tomorrow, he will bepetrified for many thousand years to come. [4-11-58]"
4-11-55,"Then those monkeys on hearing the clear wording of the sage started out from thatforest, and on their coming to Kishkindha, Vali saw them and spoke this way to them. [4-11-59]"
4-11-56," 'Why all of you dwellers of Matanga forest arrived in my presence, even so, areyou the dwellers of that forest safe?' Thus Vali asked all. [4-11-60]"
4-11-57,"Then all of those monkeys have reported to Vali, the one with a goldenchest-pendant, all the reasons for their exit, likewise the curse to Vali. [4-11-61]"
4-11-58,"Then on hearing all those words narrated by monkeys Vali approached that great sageand begged of him on becoming humble with palm-fold. [4-11-62]"
4-11-59,"The sage inconsiderate of Vali's request withdrew into hermitage, and fearing tobear the brunt of the curse Vali was distraught and withdrew from that place. [4-11-63]"
4-11-60,"Then, dreaded by the fear of curse that monkey Vali does not aspire to enter thegreat mountain Rishyamuka, oh, people's lord, Rama, or he does not even wish to look at it. ThusSugreeva continued his narration. [4-11-64]"
4-11-61,"Knowing the inaccessibility of this forest to him I got rid of my agony, Rama, andI move here about in this great forest along with my ministers. [4-11-65]"
4-11-62,"This huge heap of bones that is shining forth like a mountaintop is that ofDundubhi, which Vali once hurled by the vanity of his valour. [4-11-66]"
4-11-63,"Also these are the seven enormous sala trees full with their branches, and Vali iscapable to make each of them leafless by his vigour, of course, one at a time. [4-11-67]"
4-11-64,"Oh, Rama, I am apprising all this to tell about the unequalled vitality of Vali,and oh, king, then how is it possible for you to eliminate Vali in war. Thus Sugreeva enquiredwith Rama. [4-11-68]"
4-11-65,"When Sugreeva spoke that way Lakshmana a little smiled and asked him, ""On performingwhich act do you confide in the possibility of Vali's elimination?"" [4-11-69]"
4-11-66,"Then Sugreeva said to Lakshmana, ""earlier Vali used to agitate each of the trees,one after the other, on many occasions."" [4-11-70]"
4-11-67,"If Rama can rend one tree out of the seven with only one arrow, then on seeingRama's valour I can construe that Vali is utterly dead at his hand. [4-11-71]"
4-11-68,"Lakshmana, if he lifts and kicks the skeleton of this dead buffalo by the might ofhis foot, and makes it fall at a distance of two hundred bow-lengths, I can confide. So saidSugreeva to Lakshmana. [4-11-72]"
4-11-69,"Sugreeva paused for a while on saying thus to Rama, for Rama's eye-corners arereddened with anger towards Vali, and then Sugreeva again spoke to Rama. [4-11-73]"
4-11-70,"Vali is a mighty monkey, an intrepid one, who esteems his own intrepidity, and onewho is well renowned by his might and tenacity, and in combats he is an undefeated one.[4-11-74]"
4-11-71,"His deeds that are impracticable even for gods are obvious, and scared forrecollecting them I took shelter of Mt. Rishyamuka. [4-11-75]"
4-11-72,"Concluding that the lord of monkeys Vali to be an unconquerable, unattackable,unsympathetic one I am not leaving this Mt. Rishyamuka. [4-11-76]"
4-11-73,"I am moving about these forests along with earnest ministers like Hanuma and othersignificant ones, only because I am disconcerted and sceptical of him. [4-11-77]"
4-11-74,"I chanced upon a laudable and true friend in you, oh, Rama, the patron of friends,hence I take shelter in you, oh, tigerly man, for you are the final resort for those seekingsalvation, like Mt. Himavan. [4-11-78]"
4-11-75,"I know the might of that mighty brother-the-malice of mine, and oh, Raghava, butyour valour in combat is imprecise to me. [4-11-79]"
4-11-76,"Definitely I am neither examining, nor demeaning, nor intimidating you, but hismacabre exploits caused cowardice in me. [4-11-80]"
4-11-77,"It is definite, oh, Raghava, your word, courage, and physique denote some sublimeradiance in you, as with ash covered fire. So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-11-81]"
4-11-78,"On hearing that word of great-souled Sugreeva, Rama smilingly replied that monkey inhis turn. [4-11-82]"
4-11-79,"If you are unable to confide in the intrepidity of ours, oh, monkey, I shallingrain commendable confidence in you with respect to our action. Thus Rama said to Sugreeva.[4-11-83]"
4-11-80,"Saying so to Sugreeva in a comforting manner, he that dextrous, vigorous Rama, theelder brother of Lakshmana sportively flipped the skeleton of Dundubhi with his big toe, andflicked that withered body of the demon with his big toe itself to a ten yojana distance withoutlifting his foot. [4-11-84, 85]"
4-11-81,"Then on seeing at the hurled body, and at valiant Rama who by now is like theblazing sun, again Sugreeva said this meaningful word to Rama in the presence of Lakshmana andother monkeys. [4-11-86]"
4-11-82,"Oh, friend, at that time when my tired and tipsy brother Vali tossed this body itwas unspoilt, wet with blood and full with flesh. [4-11-87]"
4-11-83,"Raghava, now this body is sleazy, without flesh, also rendered into a strawycondition, and oh, Raghu's delight, you too flipped it because you are now energetic. [4-11-88]"
4-11-84,"If it be said something is wet or dried up there chances a lot of difference, oh,Raghava, thereby it may not be possible to assess whether you might is greater or his, as thegravity of the case depends much on that wetness or dryness alone, isn't it. [4-11-89]"
4-11-85,"That alone is the uncertainty in that matter, sire, whether your strength issuperior or his, and if a single sala tree is ripped in an outright manner the ability or otherwisewill be evident. [4-11-90]"
4-11-86,"String the bowstring to this bow of yours, an alternate of elephant's trunk, andstretch it out up to your ear, and release a great arrow. [4-11-91]"
4-11-87,"Darted by you your arrow will rip off this sala tree, oh, king, there is no doubtin that matter, enough is this thinking of yours and you will definitely do me this favour, I prayand swear upon me. [4-11-92]"
4-11-88,"As to how the sun is unsurpassed among all brilliances, as to how Himavan isunmatched among all mountains, as to how the lion is unequalled among all quadrupeds, so you areamong all men for your unique valour. So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-11-93]"
4-12-1,"On hearing the well-spoken words of Sugreeva that expressed doubt about Rama'svalour, that great resplendent Rama took-up bow to inculcate credence in Sugreeva. [4-12-1]"
4-12-2,"Rama, the bestower of dignity to the sufferers, took up his dreadful bow, aimed at asala tree, and darted single arrow, by which all the directions reverberated with the twang of hisbowstring. [4-12-2]"
4-12-3,"The golden arrow released by the mighty Rama perforated all the seven sala trees,and even the levelled areas of mountain, and then entered the earth. [4-12-3]"
4-12-4,"Thus that arrow which briskly drilled all the sala trees, came up in a moment fromunder the earth, and again swiftly re-entered the quiver of Rama. [4-12-4]"
4-12-5,"On seeing them the seven sala trees that are profoundly fissured, that best monkeySugreeva went into a stunning astonishment at the rapidity of Rama's arrow. [4-12-5]"
4-12-6,"Highly gladdened Sugreeva made palm-fold in that astonishment, kneeled while hisornaments dangled, and prostrated before Raghava with his head touching the ground. [4-12-6]"
4-12-7,"Overjoyed with that deed Sugreeva said this to that virtue-knower, the one who isproficient among all experts of missiles, namely the valorous Rama, who is just in his presencehim. [4-12-7]"
4-12-8,"You with your arrows, oh, best one among men, are capable of eliminating all thegods including Indra, oh, lord, then why to speak of Vali. [4-12-8]"
4-12-9,"By whom seven great sala trees, a mountain and also the earth is ripped off withonly one arrow, oh Kakutstha, who then can stand up to you in the vanguard of war. [4-12-9]"
4-12-10,"Today on gaining a kind-hearted friend like you, who is similar to Indra andRain-god who accord favour on their own, my distress is gone and my joy is heightened.[4-12-10]"
4-12-11,"Oh, Rama, today itself you eliminate that enemy of mine in a brother's semblancefor my happiness, for which I adjoin my palms in supplication. Thus Sugreeva requested Rama.[4-12-11]"
4-12-12,"That great percipient Rama embraced Sugreeva, which Sugreeva is pleasant in his lookfor he gained confidence by now, and who is an alternate of Lakshmana to partake Rama's affection,and then Rama said these words to such a Sugreeva in reply. [4-12-12]"
4-12-13,"Let us quickly go from here to Kishkindha, oh, Sugreeva, you move in advance, andon going there you invite that Vali, one redolent of your brotherhood."" So said Rama to Sugreeva.[4-12-13]"
4-12-14,"They all on quickly going to Kishkindha, the city of Vali, hedged themselves in thethickets of forest trees and waited. [4-12-14]"
4-12-15,"Sugreeva firmly tightened his girdle-cloth for the duel and shouted boisterously forthe purpose of inviting Vali for a duel, and his rapidity in shouting appeared as though to crackthe sky. [4-12-15]"
4-12-16,"On hearing his brother's shouting that great mighty Vali is infuriated andimpetuously rushed out of his palace chambers, like the sun falling back onto sky from his duskingbrink. [4-12-16]"
4-12-17,"Then a very tumultuous and awful fight occurred between Vali and Sugreeva, which islike the awful fight between the planets Mercury and Mars in skies. [4-12-17]"
4-12-18,"Those two brothers who are convulsed in frenzy battered each other in that fightwith their thunderbolt-like palms, and lightning-like fists. [4-12-18]"
4-12-19,"Then Rama wielding bow in his hand watched those valiant ones that are alike intheir appearance, like the Ashwin twins among gods. [4-12-19]"
4-12-20,"For which reason Raghava could not differentiate between Sugreeva or Vali, for thesame reason did not make up his mind to release his arrow, otherwise it would have been a deadeningarrow, as confusion is the only reason for Rama. [4-12-20]"
4-12-21,"Meanwhile Sugreeva is unable to spot out his benefactor Raghava as Vali whacked himdown, and thereby he immediately fled to Mt. Rishyamuka. [4-12-21]"
4-12-22,"Sugreeva is debilitated and enervated by Vali's thwacking till his limbs soaked inblood, and he entered the great forest of Rishyamuka as Vali chased him. [4-12-22]"
4-12-23,"On seeing Sugreeva's entry into the forest of Rishyamuka, Vali said to him ""you arelet off for now..."" and saying so he returned to Kishkindha from there in view of fear from curseof Sage Matanga. [4-12-23]"
4-12-24,"Raghava also came to that forest, along with his brother Lakshmana and along withHanuma, where that monkey Sugreeva fled. [4-12-24]"
4-12-25,"Seeing the arrival of Rama with Lakshmana, Sugreeva ashamedly turned his eyes downto earth and piteously spoke this without eyeing Rama [4-12-25]"
4-12-26,"Showing your dexterity you encouraged me to invite Vali for fight, but you got mebattered by my enemy, what is this done by you. [4-12-26]"
4-12-27,"You should have truly made it known at that time only, oh, Raghava, that you willnot kill Vali, then I would not have come here, to Kishkindha. [4-12-27]"
4-12-28,"Rama replied that great-souled Sugreeva who is speaking woefully with pathetic wordsin this way. [4-12-28]"
4-12-29,"Sugreeva, by which reason I have not let-off an arrow such as that of mine, thatreason may be heard and let the anger be discarded. [4-12-29]"
4-12-30,"By ornamentation, attire, physicality and movements, you and Vali look-alike.[4-12-30]"
4-12-31,"By your voice, bodily glow also thus in your looking, also in bravery and inspeech, oh monkey, I could not mark any difference. [4-12-31]"
4-12-32,"Thereby, oh, great monkey, I have not released this great speeded and enemyannihilating arrow of mine as I was confused in the similarity of your personalities. [4-12-32]"
4-12-33,"I was ambiguous by your similarities, as such I have not released this ghastly andlife-taking arrow, otherwise the basic object of ours will be ruined, isn't it. [4-12-33]"
4-12-34,"When my unawareness and fallacy hazardously afflicts none but you in the form of myown arrow, oh, brave lord of monkeys, then I will be establishing my own imbecility and naivety,isn't it. [4-12-34]"
4-12-35,"Eliminating one who is protected means a terrifying sin of highest order, even so,myself and Lakshmana and also thus Seetha with her exquisite glow are all dependent on you, and youare our shelterer in this forest. [4-12-35, 36a]"
4-12-36,"Therefore, oh, monkey, again you fight with him without doubting me, and I willrender him ineffective at this moment only with a single arrow of mine, and you can see Valisquirming on the ground. [4-12-36, 37],"
4-12-37,"You have an identification for yourself, oh lord of monkeys, by which you can beidentified when you are engaged in duel. [4-12-38]"
4-12-38,"Lakshmana, pick up this gaja creeper that is beautiful in its appearance and letthis noble souled Sugreeva be garlanded with that. So said Rama to Lakshmana. [4-12-39]"
4-12-39,"Then Lakshmana plucked that gaja creeper with flowers growing at the foot of themountain, and slung it like a garland around the neck of that Sugreeva. [4-12-40] n"
4-12-40,"He that prosperous Sugreeva with that flowery-creeper adorning his neck then shoneforth like a black rain cloud against a backdrop of rich ochry colour of sunset, and with a trainof herons adorning that cloud like a garland. [4-12-41]"
4-12-41,"He that Sugreeva whose physique became effulgent by that creeper-garland is againemboldened by Rama's words, and he again advanced to Kishkindha with Rama, and reached it again.[4-12-42]"
4-13-1,"That righteous Rama readying his great bow decorated with gold, and on taking blazing sun similar arrows that are victory-oriented in wars, proceeded from Rishyamuka along with Sugreeva to the city ruled by the valour of Vali, namely Kishkindha. [4-13-1, 2]"
4-13-2,"Stern-necked Sugreeva and the great mighty Lakshmana strode ahead of that great soul Rama. [4-13-3]"
4-13-3,"The brave Hanuma, dauntless Nala and Neela, and the captain of monkey&#39;s captains Tara of great energy followed them rearward. [4-13-4]"
4-13-4,"They moved on looking at the trees that are drooping with the weight of their flowers, and at he rivers that are carrying pleasant water while themselves are coursing towards ocean. [4-13-5]"
4-13-5,"They on seeing house-like caverns, crags, ravines and caves, and monumental peaks, cavities that are pleasant for sight have moved on. [4-13-6]"
4-13-6,"On their way they observed lakes that are glistening forth with gem-like waters without slime, and with lotus buds in budding stage. [4-13-7]"
4-13-7,"Those lakes are reverberant with Karandava-s, Saarasa-s, Swans, Vanjula-s and other waterfowls, also like that with Chakravaaka-s and other birds. [4-13-8]"
4-13-8,"They have seen fearless deer feeding on soft grass blades everywhere, somewhere moving here and there in the forest, and else where standing. [4-13-9]"
4-13-9,"They have also seen the forest elephants that have white tusks for their ornaments and that are moving in herds, and which are the dangerous enemies of lakes as they destroy lakebeds. [4-13-10]"
4-13-10,"Also seen are the vigorous and elephantine monkeys that are like mobile mountains, begrimed with dust, and bellowing on mountain ridges. [4-13-11]"
4-13-11,"On seeing other forest beings in that forest and birds moving aloft in sky, those followers of Sugreeva quickly moved on. [4-13-12]"
4-13-12,"While they are quickly going, Rama, the delight of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, saw there a clump of forest trees and he asked Sugreeva like this. [4-13-13]"
4-13-13,"This cluster of trees surrounded with plantain trees is like an accumulation of thick clouds, and this is shining forth like a cloudscape in sky. [4-13-14]"
4-13-14,"What is this? I wish to know and oh, friend, I wish you to clear this inquisitiveness of mine. [4-13-15]"
4-13-15,"On hearing that sentence of that great soul Raghava, then Sugreeva described about the significance of that forest while proceeding on the way. [4-13-16]"
4-13-16,"Raghava, this spacious hermitage with abundant gardens and dainty tubers, fruits and water is a weary remover. Thus Sugreeva started telling Rama. [4-13-17]"
4-13-17,"There were hermits named <em>sapta jana</em>, Seven Persons, who were dourly vowed with their heads pendulous downward and legs up, as in <em>shiirSa aasana</em> , the upside-down yogic body posture, and who always reclined in water. [4-13-18]"
4-13-18,"They were making diet on air alone that too once in seven days, and living unwaveringly in that way they practised their asceticism for seven hundred years and went to heavens with their bodies. [4-13-19]"
4-13-19,"This hermitage that has encircling trees for its compound wall has become highly unassailable even for Indra together with all gods and demons. [4-13-20]"
4-13-20,"Birds and other forest moving animals forbear this hermitage and those that unknowingly enter in there they do not return. [4-13-21]"
4-13-21,"From there artistically worded lyrical and instrumental tunes, and even the sounds of ornaments are audible, and oh, Raghava, one can sense a divine fragrance too. [4-13-22]"
4-13-22,"Even the triadic ritual-fires glow there, and their thick and ochry coloured smoke like that of a reddish-brown pigeon is apparent muffling the treetops. [4-13-23]"
4-13-23,"When that smoke is mantling their tops these trees are beaming forth like mountains of gems overlaid with clusters of clouds. [4-13-24]"
4-13-24,"Offer salutations determinedly and adjoining palms addressing the sages called Seven Persons, oh Raghava, along with brother Lakshmana [4-13-25]"
4-13-25,"Those that offer salutations to those sages with contemplated souls will evince no bodily trauma in the least. Thus said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-13-26]"
4-13-26,"Then Rama along with brother Lakshmana adjoined palms, addressed himself to the great-souled sages known as Seven Persons, and offered salutations to them. [4-13-27]"
4-13-27,"That righteous Rama along with brother Lakshmana, Sugreeva and other monkeys having worshipped those sages proceeded to Kishkindha well-pleased at heart. [4-13-28]"
4-13-28,"Having gone a long way from that hermitage of Seven Persons they have seen that unassailable and Vali ruled city namely Kishkindha. [4-13-29]"
4-13-29,"Then Rama&#39;s bother Lakshmana, Rama, and other monkeys wielding their weapons and flaring with their upsurged fiery again came to eliminate that enemy Vali to the city that is ruled by the brawn of the same Vali, the son of Indra. [4-13-30]"
4-14-1,"They all on quickly going to Kishkindha, the city of Vali, hedged themselves in thethickets of forest trees and waited. [4-14-1]"
4-14-2,"That forest lover with tumultuous voice Sugreeva cast his eye everywhere and assumedtremendous fury. [4-14-2]"
4-14-3,"Then Sugreeva encompassed by his followers war-whooped ghastlily, like a great cloudthat emerged accelerated by gusty wind and that is thundering as though to rip the sky, invitingVali for fight. [4-14-3]"
4-14-4,"Then Sugreeva who is like the rising sun and whose stride is like that of a proudlion saw the adroit Rama and then said this sentence. [4-14-4b, 5a]"
4-14-5," She whose arch-way is decorated in gold, who is spread out with snares of monkeys,and who is impregnated with flags and machinery, we arrived at such city of Vali, Kishkindha.[4-14-5b, 6a]"
4-14-6,"Oh Brave one, you make happen the promise you earlier made regarding theelimination of Vali on time, like the time of sprouting that enables a creeper-plant to bear asprout on time. [4-14-6b, 7a]"
4-14-7,"When thus said by Sugreeva that enemy-destroyer and righteous Raghava said this wordSugreeva. [4-14-7b, 8a]"
4-14-8,"By which creeper-garland that Lakshmana plucked out and garlanded you, by thiscreeper-garland of gaja-flowers alone your identification is marked. [4-14-8b, 9a]"
4-14-9,"Oh brave-one, you are shining forth with this creeper-garland laced at your necklike the night time sun with a garland of stars. [4-14-9b, 10a]"
4-14-10,"Oh Vanara, today itself I will set you free from the fear and enmity whipped up byVali by releasing a single arrow in fight. [4-14-10b, 11a]"
4-14-11,"You show me your enemy in a brother's mien, oh, monkey, by then he will be rollingin the dust of this forest eliminated by me. [4-14-11b, 12a]"
4-14-12,"If he returns to live even after my espying him then immediately you can find faultwith me, you can even deride me. [4-14-12b, 13a]"
4-14-13,"Seven saala trees are rived with a single of arrow of mine in your presence,thereby be sure that Vali will be dispatched now, by my might. [4-14-13b, 14a]"
4-14-14,"Just bound by the anxiousness to implement righteousness untruth is unsaid by meearlier though I am involved in distresses for a long time, and hereafter it will not be said inanywise. [4-14-14b, 15a]"
4-14-15,"As Indra fructifies the sprouted paddy field I will make happen my promise, henceleave off your perplexity. [4-14-15b, 16a]"
4-14-16,"Thereby to invite that Vali with golden pendant, oh, Sugreeva, you make such awar-cry by which that monkey Vali comes out. [4-14-16b, 17a]"
4-14-17,"Vali is a willing fighter who shines forth by his victories and one who is givenovation for his triumphs, and undefeated by you as yet, such as he is he may be incited withwar-whoop so that he comes out without any hindrance. [4-14-17b, 18a]"
4-14-18,"One who is assertive of his own valour will not tolerate to hear enemy's daring ina brawl, that too in the presence of ladies. So said Rama to Sugreeva. [4-14-18b, 19a]"
4-14-19,"On hearing the words of Rama he that Sugreeva with golden yellow complexion blared agruesome blare as though to completely rend the sky. [4-14-19b, 20a]"
4-14-20,"By that sound of Sugreeva the splendour of cows is marred and they are runninghelter-skelter like the well-born ladies who are mishandled by invaders due to the misrule of theirown king. [4-14-20b, 21a]"
4-14-21,"And deer are hurriedly fleeing like war worsted horses, and the sky-flying birds arefalling to ground like planets or stars when their merit diminishes. [4-14-21b, c]"
4-14-22,"Sugreeva, the son of Sun, who is well-known for cloud like thundering, and whosevigour is now reinforced by his bravery, then promptly released an oceanic roar like an ocean withsplashing waves drifted by gales. [4-14-22]"
4-15-1,"Then the illiberal Vali has clearly heard that outcry of his plain-spoken brotherSugreeva from his palace chambers. [4-15-1]"
4-15-2,"On hearing Sugreeva's outcry that is shuddering all beings Vali's insolence isdiminished as high furore superimposed on it. [4-15-2]"
4-15-3,"Then, embitterment overspreading on all his limbs Vali with golden-hue isimmediately rendered non-luminous like the eclipsed sun. [4-15-3]"
4-15-4,"With asymmetrical teeth and with burning fireball like eyes Vali is reflective of alake whose red-lotuses are uprooted leaving stalks afloat. [4-15-4]"
4-15-5,"That monkey Vali then on hearing that intolerable noise bolted out of palacechambers thumping his feet as though to shatter the earth. [4-15-5]"
4-15-6,"His wife Tara stepped in and showing goodwill and amity hugged him, for she is infear and bewilderment, and said this word that is beneficial in its futurity if Vali heeds it.[4-15-6]"
4-15-7,"Oh brave one, you better gently leave off this anger that is coming on like agushing river as is done with an enjoyed chaplet on getting up from bed in early hours.[4-15-7]"
4-15-8,"Oh, monkey, you can fight with him in early hours of tomorrow, oh, brave one,evidently you neither have divers enemies nor your valour is trivialised."
4-15-9,"You can fight with him at appropriate time, thereby your enemy is neither glorifiednor you are trivialised evidently, for you are a braving one. [4-15-8]"
4-15-10,"Your quick exiting is disagreeable for me, and what for you are dissuaded that maybe listened as I tell. [4-15-9]"
4-15-11,"Earlier Sugreeva came assaulting and inviting you for a combat, and you also havegone out and rendered him as a nonentity, and being battered by you he fled in all directions.[4-15-10]"
4-15-12,"He who is undone earlier by you, particularly after torturing by you, his cominghere again and inviting you for a duel is causing a doubt in me. [4-15-11]"
4-15-13,"The arrogance and endeavour of the shouter, and even the rampage of his furore, allthese will not have a trivial reason, isn't it. [4-15-12]"
4-15-14,"I do not think that Sugreeva has come here unaccompanied, and on whom he isdependant must be an unflinching support foregathered by Sugreeva. [4-15-13]"
4-15-15,"By his nature Sugreeva is an expert and even so a clever one, and he does not enterinto friendship with anyone without examining his mettle. [4-15-14]"
4-15-16,"I am already briefed by our son Angada's information, and what I have heard I willnow relate that helpful word to you. [4-15-15]"
4-15-17,"Son Angada said this account when he returned from forests, and to him spies aresaid to have reported this. [4-15-16]"
4-15-18,"Those that are born in Ikshvaku dynasty, sons of the king of Ayodhya, valiant andunconquerable ones in war, called Rama and Lakshmana are there in this country. These twounassailable ones have chanced there at Sugreeva's place to fulfil the longing desire of Sugreeva.[4-15-17, 18a]"
4-15-19,"He is an acclaimed one for his warfare, and like the fire flaring up at the end ofera he shatters the strength of enemies, and he is Rama your brother's helpmate, they say so.[4-15-18b, 19a]"
4-15-20,"And he is said to the habitable tree for the polite, the ultimate course for thewoebegone, a hospice for the agonised, and for grace Rama is the only abode. [4-15-19b, 20a]"
4-15-21,"He is endowed with the knowledge of mundane and ultra-mundane things, he alwaysabides in the directives of his father, and as with Mt. Himalayas for all natural elements he isthe greatest mine of merits. [4-15-20b, 21a]"
4-15-22,"By that reason, with that unconquerable on in conflicts, an imponderable one and agreat-soul Rama, your enmity is inapposite. [4-15-21b, 22a]"
4-15-23,"Oh dauntless one, I tell you this much that you shall not become overcritical ofhim, and what I say is beneficial to you that may now be listened and even implemented. [4-15-22b,23a]"
4-15-24,"Oh, king, let Sugreeva be decorously and quickly anointed as prince regent, and oh,resolute one, let there be no hostility to your own younger brother. [4-15-23b, 24a]"
4-15-25,"Achieving unanimity with Sugreeva and solidarity with Rama by discarding enmity, ineffect is appropriate for you, thus I deem. [4-15-24b, 25a]"
4-15-26,"This Sugreeva is your younger brother and you should be keen about him, isn't it...and whether he is here or there in Rishyamuka he is just your brother. [4-15-25b, 26a]"
4-15-27,"Indeed, I do not see anyone on earth a coequal to him in kindred spirit, henceleave off this enmity and honour him with bestowals and felicitations as an insider, and retain himat your side. [4-15-26b, 27]"
4-15-28,"That boisterously voiced Sugreeva is indisputably an excellent kinsman of yours,and hence brace yourself with the fondness of brotherhood, as there is no other way out to you.[4-15-28]"
4-15-29,"If you look upon to do my favoured deed, and if you look upon me as an expedientone, I beg of you in our loving attachment that my gentle word of advise be done. [4-15-29]"
4-15-30,"Be graceful and it behove you to listen to my small but expedient talk, andfollowing up rancour alone is unbecoming of you, thereby your confrontation with the Prince ofKosala will be unpardonable for his dynamism equals that of Indra. Thus Tara spoke to her husbandVali. [4-15-30]"
4-15-31,"Then, though Tara spoke beneficial and advisable words they are unimpressive to Valifor he is impounded by fatality and driven by time to his doom. [4-15-31]"
4-16-1,"While Tara with a face that shines like the lord of stars is speaking thus, Vali dauntingly spoke to her with these words. [4-16-1]"
4-16-2,"He is an younger brother and an adversary in particular, oh, pretty-faced Tara, can I by any reason tolerate him when he kept raving on frenetically, tell me. [4-16-2]"
4-16-3,"To those valiant ones who neither give ground nor get assailed in wars, oh, shyly, endurance of a overweening war-whoop is more than death. [4-16-3]"
4-16-4,"I am incapable of withstanding that dumbly Sugreeva&#39;s bawling commotion desiring a brawling duel. [4-16-4]"
4-16-5,"Also, you need not bother about Raghava&#39;s doing some harm to me, as I wonder how a diligent man and knower of virtue can commit sin. [4-16-5]"
4-16-6,"How do you follow me again, you return with all these females, truly you have expressed your friendliness owing to your devotion to me. [4-16-6]"
4-16-7,"You may do away with your perplexity as I will retaliate Sugreeva on my going there only to drive him and his arrogance out, but without letting his lives loose. [4-16-7]"
4-16-8,"As he is firmed up for a combat, I will indeed have to effectuate what his desire is, by caning with trees and fistfights, by which roughed up he returns. [4-16-8]"
4-16-9,"My nerve and pace of combat will be insufferable to that malign minded Sugreeva, oh, Tara, you have offered your helping suggestion and you have shown all your friendliness to me, it is enough. [4-16-9]"
4-16-10,"I adjured you on my lives, return with your followers, and I shall return to you on easily defeating and returning that &#39;brother of mine. Said Vali to Tara. [4-16-10]"
4-16-11,"She that pleasant articulator and talented Tara then hugged and circumabulated Vali, suppressing her moaning, as an honour to the braver. [4-16-11]"
4-16-12,"Then she who is a hymnodist that Tara has performed a hymnal bon voyage wishing triumph to Vali, and entered palace chambers along with other females, disoriented by her own sadness. [4-16-12]"
4-16-13,"On Tara entering her own palace chambers along with other females, Vali emerged out of the city hissing like an infuriated great snake. [4-16-13]"
4-16-14,"He that highly rancorous Vali suspired with high audacity and spread his sight everywhere intending to sight his enemy. [4-16-14]"
4-16-15,"Then that celebrated Vali saw Sugreeva who is in golden-ochre hue, whose girdle cloth is tightened for a fight, and who is with an air of self-confidence, blazing like fiery-fire. [4-16-15]"
4-16-16,"That strong armed Vali who is highly provoked has also tightened his girdle cloth on seeing proximately available Sugreeva. [4-16-16]"
4-16-17,"He that formidable Vali strongly tightening his girdle-cloth too, and proceeded towards Sugreeva in a well timed manner uplifting fists to fight him off. [4-16-17]"
4-16-18,"Even Sugreeva has come at that imprudent Vali with golden pendant, on tightening his fists, lifting them up at the ready, and aiming them well at Vali. [4-16-18]"
4-16-19,"Vali spoke this word to that Sugreeva who is swooping down on him, whose eyes are reddened in fury, and who is an expert and expeditious in fighting. [4-16-19]"
4-16-20,"Properly clenching fingers this great fist of mine is firmly clenched, and it will unclench only on taking your lives when I pitch this on you at full speed. So said Vali threateningly to Sugreeva. [4-16-20]"
4-16-21,"Thus said, Sugreeva with high dudgeon said, this fist of mine shall fall on your forehead plundering your lives. [4-16-21]"
4-16-22,"Coming near instantaneously Vali hit him, whereby Sugreeva is enraged and became like a mountain streaming blood in its torrents. [4-16-22]"
4-16-23,"But Sugreeva unhesitatingly uprooted a saala tree with his force and thrashed the limbs of Vali as with the thunderbolt thrashing a great mountain. [4-16-23]"
4-16-24,"But Vali when thwacked with saala tree had staggered and looked like a tossing ship in an ocean filled with heavy weight of merchandise and brimming with merchants, but on the brink of wrecking. [4-16-24]"
4-16-25,"Those two, Vali and Sugreeva, with their sensational energy, triumphing zeal, frightful physiques, swiftness as good as the Divine Eagle Garuda, vigilance in exploring perilous body parts of one another, ravagement of their own enemies fought frighteningly, like the sun and moon in the sky, which is inconceivable. [4-16-25, 26a]"
4-16-26,"But Vali being the possessor of might and vigour progressed and though greatly mighty is son of sun, Sugreeva, regressed. [4-16-26b, 27a]"
4-16-27,"Sugreeva became retardant in aggression when Vali routed his pride and then he exasperatedly started searching for Raghava to counteract Vali. [4-16-27]"
4-16-28,"Among those two there happened a deadly fight time and again using trees with branches, peaks of mountains, their own nails that are similar to the razor-sharp edges of thunderbolts, and with fists, knees, feet, and arms, like the fight that once chanced between demon Vritra and Indra. [4-16-28b, 29]"
4-16-29,"Those forest moving vanara-s that are soaked in blood have gone on clashing, threatening each other, like two clouds clashing uproariously. [4-16-30]"
4-16-30,"Raghava has then seen the lord of monkeys Sugreeva who is repeatedly eyeing all sides for help and who is even deteriorating in his enterprise. [4-16-31]"
4-16-31,"On seeing the lord of monkeys Sugreeva in a forlornness, then the refulgent and fearless Rama scanned for an arrow aiming to eliminate Vali. [4-16-32]"
4-16-32,"Then on tautening a venomous serpent like arrow in the bow, Rama started to draw out bowstring, whereby that bow attained a similitude with the Time-disc of the Terminator. [4-16-33]"
4-16-33,"At the blast of bowstring the lordly birds and animals are panicked, like those that will be startled by the approach of ear ending, and they all fled. [4-16-34]"
4-16-34,"The arrow released by Raghava that has the boom of thunderbolt&#39;s thunderclap and the flashes of a lightning fell on the chest of Vali. [4-16-35]"
4-16-35,"Hit by the fleetness of that arrow then that highly magnificent and intrepid lord of monkeys Vali fell onto the plane of earth. [4-16-36]"
4-16-36,"Like the flag that will be raised in honour of Indra during the month of ashvin on a full-moon day, but thrown onto earth along with its flagstaff after the festival, Vali with depleted energy and dissipated vitality slowly fell onto ground, and with tears blocking throat he moaned piteously. [4-16-37]"
4-16-37,"That best one among men Rama released a blazing and enemy subjugating arrow which in simile is like an Epoch-ender at the end of era, and that best arrow decorated in gold and silver looked like the glance from the Third-Eye of Rudra, emitting fire with smoke. [4-16-38]"
4-16-38,"That Indra&#39;s son Vali, dampened with blood and sweat, then looked like just felled Ashoka tree which has stemmed up and so far standing high on a mountain with fully bloomed clusters of its blood-red flowers, and when his anima is undone he even looked like the flagstaff on which a flag is raised in honour of Indra, but which is altogether dislodged and abandoned on the ground. [4-16-39]"
4-17-1,"When Rama&#39;s arrow hit him then Vali, the scourger in war, suddenly fell down like a hewed down tree. [4-17-1]"
4-17-2,"He who glittered with pure golden ornaments, that Vali fell down on earth while all of his limbs sank to dust, like the flag of Indra when released from its ropes. [4-17-2]"
4-17-3,"On the fall of that lord of hosts of monkeys and bears onto earth, unilluminated is the earth like the welkin that has forsooth lost its moon. [4-17-3]"
4-17-4,"Though that great souled Vali fell onto earth, neither his brilliance, nor lives, nor resplendence, nor his bravery are unfettering from his body. [4-17-4]"
4-17-5,"That superb and gem-studded golden pendent given by Indra sustained that monkey chief&#39;s lives, resplendence and brilliance. [4-17-5]"
4-17-6,"By still wearing that golden chest-pendant around his neck, that brave general of monkeys Vali appeared like a black-cloud smeared with the colour of golden sunset all around its edges. [4-17-6]"
4-17-7,"Even though Vali has fallen on ground his splendour is as though refulgent devising itself into three aspects, namely by his body, chest-pendant, and the arrow of Rama, which arrow is given to strike the crucial body parts alone, and which is still stuck in Vali&#39;s chest. [4-17-7]"
4-17-8,"That arrow which effectuates the pathway to heaven, now discharged from the bow of Rama has brought forth that redemption to brave Vali . [4-17-8]"
4-17-9,"Then on seeing him who has fallen in war, the one with golden pendant, enormously chested, mightily armed, face golden, eye greenish, but who is like a fire extinct of its flame; who is like Indra in unassailability and like Upendra in indomitability; and who like Yayaati who has fallen from heaven, as well like the sun who falls onto earth from solar orbit when Time-ender flings him at the end of era; such as he is, on seeing that son of Indra, who forsooth has fallen, Rama neared him followed by Lakshmana. [4-17-9, 10, 11, 12a]"
4-17-10,"On seeing the brave Vali fallen like that, who by now is like fire with extinguished tongues of flames, and who is seeing droopily, those two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, neared him with due honour. [4-17-12b, 13]"
4-17-11,"On seeing Rama and the great mighty Lakshmana as well, he who fell to ground flatly hurt by arrow, and whose energy and lives are trifling and vigour trivialised thereby, that Vali spoke these sarcastic words in his proper pride to Rama, who is taking pride in this conflict as a victor, which words at the same time have meaning, politeness, and self-righteousness. [4-17-14, 15]"
4-17-12,"You are a renowned prince with pleasing looks.. but, which kind of death I am getting now, that too when I was in the commotion of conflict with another, alas, that ignoble death is owing to you, and what merit is achieved by you in this undertaking of yours to kill someone who is facing away from you... [4-17-16]"
4-17-13,"Rama is high-born, they say, gifted with mightiness, resplendent, pursuer of vows, mindful of mercy, delighter in people&#39;s welfare, sympathetic, greatly enthusiastic and assertively committed in doing good deeds, knower of time-and-action, all these living-beings on earth are thus relating your renown, aren&#39;t they. [4-17-17, 18]"
4-17-14,"To be able to control senses and will, forgiveness, conscientiousness, resoluteness, truthfulness, and adventurousness, oh, king, are the aptitudes of a king, and even punishing the wrongdoers, too. [4-17-19]"
4-17-15,"Concluding that those kingly characteristics will be obtainable in you, and even judging by the noble dynasty of yours, I have confronted Sugreeva though Tara dissuaded me. [4-17-20]"
4-17-16,"When you have not appeared before me when I confronted Sugreeva my concept was, &#39;it will be inapt of Rama to hurt me while I am combating with another combatant, besides, when I will be unvigilant in that fight...&#39; [4-17-21]"
4-17-17,"Not known that your soul is put to death, not known that you are the unrighteous flag bearer of righteousness, to me not known that you are insidious like straw covered well. [4-17-22]"
4-17-18,"I have no knowledge that you are a sinner, one in the garb of a benign soul, and explicitly mantled under the garb of probity like ash covered fire. [4-17-23]"
4-17-19,"I am non-guilty as I have not committed any misdeed either in your country or in your city, nor I have taunted you; I am a vanara subsisting on fruits and tubers and always moving in forests alone; such as I am, what made you to torture me when I was not combating with you en face, furthermore, when I was involved with another? [4-17-24, 25]"
4-17-20,"You are renowned to be a prince with charming looks, oh, king, and indications agreeable to rectitude are also appearing on your body. [4-17-26]"
4-17-21,"Will anybody born in Kshatriya&#39;s family, a learned one in Veda-s, thereby who is rid of ambiguities with respect to right and wrong, and who is cloaked in an air of probity, execute such a ruthless deed like this? [4-17-27]"
4-17-22,"Though born in Raghava&#39;s dynasty and renowned as a moralist you are actually amoral, and for what purpose you run around with this moral aspect? [4-17-28]"
4-17-23,"Influencing, largesse, forbearance, probity, candour, and conquering are the attributes of the kings, oh, king, and even punishing the wrongdoers. [4-17-29]"
4-17-24,"We as animals live in forests while you are city dwellers, we live by eating fruits and tubers while you enjoy feasts and banquets, our nature is such to kill and get killed, thus you and me have no correlation. And you, even if you are a man and a prince for humans, you resorted to this animalistic way of killing me lying in the wait, thus your action is worse than that of an animal, if not subhuman or un-princely. [4-17-30]"
4-17-25,"Territory, gold, and silver will be the causes while counteracting somebody, in that case, by what you are decoyed into these forests of mine or in the fruits of mine. [4-17-31]"
4-17-26,"In the pairs of propriety and compliance, punishment and pardoning, no admixture is exercised in kingcraft, for the kings do not conduct themselves volitionally. [4-17-32]"
4-17-27,"But, to you your self-interests are primary, and you are a wrathful, capricious, contriver of kingcraft, and an impetuous shooting-happy archer. [4-17-33]"
4-17-28,"Oh, king, you have no devotion to probity, nor your mind is firm about material gains, but as a free-willed one you are distracted by senses. [4-17-34]"
4-17-29,"How you are answerable to gentlemen, Rama, when you have done this detestable deed of killing an unoffending one like me with your arrow? [4-17-35]"
4-17-30,"A regicide, a Brahman-cide, a cow-slayer, a thief, an inveterate killer, an atheist, and an younger brother who marries before his elder, all of them will go to hell. [4-17-36]"
4-17-31,"A slander-monger, skinflint, friend-killer and one who makes love with his teacher&#39;s wife, they all go to the worlds of evil-souls, no doubt about it. [4-17-37]"
4-17-32,"My skin is unwearable, holy people forbid my hair and bones, and uneatable is my meat for your kind of reputable people. [4-17-38]"
4-17-33,"Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s. [4-17-39]"
4-17-34,"Sensible people will not touch my skin and bones, oh, king, nor meats from my body are to be eaten, such as I am, a five-nailed animal, I am killed. [4-17-40]"
4-17-35,"Though Tara appraised me with truthful and favourable words, I just disregarded her advise owing to my own delusion, and gone into the control of Time. [4-17-41]"
4-17-36,"With you as her espouser the Earth is not with a correct spouse, as with any lady who is with full-fledged chastity, but with a husband who is without rectitude. [4-17-42]"
4-17-37,"How are you borne to that great-souled Dasharatha when you are artful, felonious, knavish, disposed to a false modesty subconsciously, and an evildoer? [4-17-43]"
4-17-38,"I am killed by an elephant called Rama that snapped off its girdle-cord called tradition, that infringed the conventions of righteous people, and that discarded the goad called virtue. [4-17-44]"
4-17-39,"On accomplishing this sort of unpropitious, unjustified killing, which is condemned by the righteous people, what can you say when you meet the godly men? [4-17-45]"
4-17-40,"The valour that which is displayed on the unprejudiced few like us, oh, Rama, I do not see that sort of valour is shown by you in respect of your enemies. [4-17-46]"
4-17-41,"Had you been in combat with me en face oh, prince, you would have been killed by me and by now you would have seen the death-god Yama. [4-17-47]"
4-17-42,"An unassailable one, such as I am, I am killed by you while you remained invisible on the field of fight, as with a sinner bitten by a snake while he is asleep. [4-17-48]"
4-17-43,"For which purpose I am killed, intending to do good to Sugreeva is incidental to it, you should have assigned me for that purpose in the first instance itself, and I would have brought that evil-minded demon Ravana, the abductor of your wife in one day, that too without killing him in any fight, but by fastening him by neck, and I would have presented Maithili to you. [3-17-49, 50]"
4-17-44,"I would have brought Maithili at your order even if she is lodged in oceanic waters or in nether worlds, as with the White Horse of Vedic lore. [4-17-51]"
4-17-45,"The fact of Sugreeva&#39;s getting the kingdom after my going to heaven is proper, but the fact of your killing me in war, unrighteously, is improper. [4-17-52]"
4-17-46,"Admittedly the world is this way, and if possible a relevant reply may gently be thought ofabout your propriety in killing me... So said Vali to Rama. [4-17-53]"
4-17-47,"That great-souled son of a vanara king Vali, whom the arrow impaled and agonised, on keenly seeing Rama whose resplendence equals the brightness of the sun, said that much and remained silent when his mouth has dried up. [4-17-54]"
4-18-1,"Thus, Vali who is hit down by arrow and who is collapsing humbly spoke exacting words that contained probity, meaningfulness, and expedience, to Rama. [4-18-1]"
4-18-2,"Then to him who is rendered like a lusterless sun, fizzling out like a cloud that released its water, and who became like a quenched fire, to such a best monkey and an unexcelled lord of monkeys who has just now imputed Rama with words that are abounding with righteousness and meaningfulness, Rama spoke subsequently. [4-18-3, 4]"
4-18-3,"Uncaring for probity, prosperity, pleasure deriving, and even for the social conventions, now how do you rebuke me childishly in this matter? [4-18-4]"
4-18-4,"Unconsulted are the doyens of your race that are intellectually well off and agreeable to your mentors about rights and wrongs about your deeds, oh, gentle one, how do you wish to debate with me in this matter with your primate&#39;s caprice. [4-18-5]"
4-18-5,"This earth with its mountains, woods, and forests, even along with the authority to condone or condemn the animals, birds, and humans on it belongs to Ikshvaku-s. [4-18-6]"
4-18-6,"He who is virtue-souled, truth-abiding, plain-speaking, and the knower of the import of probity, pleasures, and prosperity, and the one who is concerned in controlling or condoning his subjects, that Bharata is the ruler of earth. [4-18-7]"
4-18-7,"In whom both scrupulousness and benignancy are there, truthfulness is firmed up, and valour as evinced by scriptures is evident, and he who is the knower of time and place is the king, namely Bharata. [4-18-8]"
4-18-8,"Holding his virtuous decree desiring to keep up the continuum of righteousness, we and some other kings are wayfaring this earth in its entirety. [4-18-9]"
4-18-9,"While that Bharata, the kingly-tiger and a patron of virtue, is ruling the earth in its entirety, who is there to conduct himself in an unacceptable way to morality on it? [4-18-10]"
4-18-10,"Abiding in our own pre-eminent righteousness, and even abiding by the order of Bharata we punish him who deviated from the path of morality, according to custom. [4-18-11]"
4-18-11,"As for you, you brought virtue to a state of decadence, rendered yourself reprovable by your own decadent behaviour, for carnality alone has become your primary doctrine, and thus you have not abided by the conduct meetly to a king. [4-18-12]"
4-18-12,"It is to be known by him who treads the way of righteousness that he has three fatherly personages, namely his own father, his elder brother, and the one who accords education to him. [4-18-13]"
4-18-13,"An younger brother, a son, and a disciple with good characteristics, these three are to be deemed as one&#39;s own sons, for such matters take base on rectitude alone. [4-18-14]"
4-18-14,"The probity practised by principled people is very subtle and highly imponderable, and the soul that abides in the hearts of all beings alone can differentiate between just and unjust. [4-18-15]"
4-18-15,"Like a blind by birth counselling with similarly blind, you being a vacillant, on your counselling only with frantic minded vacillant monkeys, what can you really fathom about right and wrong? [4-18-16]"
4-18-16,"I will clarify about the words I have said, but I tell you that it is indeed inapt of you to disdain me just out of your outrage. [4-18-17]"
4-18-17,"Realise this reason by which I have eliminated you... you misbehaved with your brother&#39;s wife, forsaking the perpetual tradition. [4-18-18]"
4-18-18,"While the great-souled Sugreeva is still alive, you with your habit of sinful acts have lustily misbehaved with Sugreeva&#39;s wife Ruma, who should be counted as your daughter-in-law. [4-18-19]"
4-18-19,"Thereby, oh, vanara, this punishment is imposed on you, for your dissolute sinning in abusing your brother&#39;s wife, thereby for your transgression of tradition and virtue. [4-18-20]"
4-18-20,"I foresee no other kind of control other than punishment to him who conducts himself contrary to the society and who is deviant of conventions. [4-18-21]"
4-18-21,"As a Kshatriya emerged from a best dynasty I do not tolerate your wrongdoing, and the punishment to the one who lustfully indulges with his daughter, or with his sister, or with the wife of his younger brother is his elimination, as recalled from scriptures. [4-18-22, 23a]"
4-18-22,"While Bharata is the lord of land and we are his proxies adhering to his orders, and while you too have overstepped the bounds of rightness, then how is it possible to be lenient? [4-18-23b, 24a]"
4-18-23,"While ruling righteously sensible Bharata punishes him who oversteps the momentous virtue, and he is poised to put down lustful ones. [4-18-24b, 25a]"
4-18-24,"As for us, oh, monkey&#39;s lord, we effectuate our brother&#39;s orders and our duty, and we stand for curbing your kind of shatterers of ethics. [4-18-25b, c]"
4-18-25,"My association with Sugreeva is as good as that with Lakshmana, nevertheless it betided with an understanding to regain Sugreeva&#39;s wife and kingdom, and he will give succour to me. [4-18-26]"
4-18-26,"I gave a promise to Sugreeva at the time of befriending him in the presence of vanara-s, and how is it possible for my kind to dishonour a given promise? [4-18-27]"
4-18-27,"Thereby you have to infer that a befitting punishment is given to you, owing to all these great reasons that abound with virtue and with supreme value. [4-18-28]"
4-18-28,"Anywise, you have to regard the punishment given to you is legitimate, and he whom rectitude guides has to render assistance to his friend, in any event. [4-18-29]"
4-18-29,"Had you pursued rightness you too would have done the same deed in imposing such a punishment, and we hear two verses that are given to the advocacy of good conventions, which the experts of rightness have also accepted, and which are said to be coined by Manu, and I too conducted myself only as detailed in those verses of law. [4-18-30]"
4-18-30," &#39;When kings impose proper punishment on the humans who have sinned, they become sinless and enter heaven as with the pious souls with good deeds.&#39; So says one verse of Manu. [4-18-31]"
4-18-31," &#39;Either by punishment or by clemency a thief will be absolved from sin, but the king who does not impose proper punishment will derive the blot of that sin.&#39; So says the other verse of Manu. [4-18-32]"
4-18-32,"When a renouncer has committed sin like that of the one committed by you, my venerable ancestor Maandhaata has given punishment which he desired. [4-18-33]"
4-18-33,"Such sin is acquired even by other kings who are unobservant in imposing proper punishment, and those kings had to make amends for it at appropriate time, by that propitiation they used to mitigate that filth of that sin. [4-18-34]"
4-18-34,"Thereby, enough with your annoyance, oh, tigerly vanara, as your elimination is devised righteously, and we too are not independent. [4-18-35]"
4-18-35,"Oh, brave and best one among monkeys, further listen to another cause, and on listening that important cause you will not be infuriated. [4-18-36]"
4-18-36,"I have neither angst nor ire in this matter of my eliminating you, or, your reviling me, oh, best monkey, but listen to the other point I wish to make clear. People will be capturing several animals, either covertly or overtly, with snares, springes and even with numerous contrivances. [4-18-37, 38a]"
4-18-37,"Meat eating people will undeniably kill animals, either they are speedily sprinting or standing steadily, fully dismayed or undismayed, vigilant or unvigilant, and even if they are facing away, in that there is no sacrilege. [4-18-38b, 39]"
4-18-38,"In this world even the kingly sages well-versed in virtue will go on hunting, and hunting is no face to face game, as such, oh, vanara, therefore I felled you in combat with my arrow because you are a tree-branch animal, whether you are not combating with me or combating against me. [4-18-40]"
4-18-39,"Kings are the bounteous benefactors of the unobtainable righteousness and propitious lifestyles, oh, best vanara, no doubt about it. [4-18-41]"
4-18-40,"They the kings are not to be harmed, also not to be reproved, not disparaged and nothing displeasing is spoken to them, as they are the divinities conducting themselves in human form on the plane of earth. [4-18-42]"
4-18-41,"I am abiding by the ethicalness practised by my father and forefathers, but you revile me without the knowledge of rightness, just by clinging to your rancour. Thus said Rama to dying Vali. [4-18-43]"
4-18-42,"Vali is much distressed at heart of hearts when Rama has said categorically in that way, whereby, deriving certitude about rightness he found no incorrectness with Rama. [4-18-44]"
4-18-43,"That lord of vanara-s then replied Rama with adjoined palms, oh, best one among men, what all you have said is that way proper, undoubtedly. [4-18-45]"
4-18-44,"Indeed an ignoble cannot disprove a nobleman, Raghava, and with regards to the undesirable and improper words I have unwittingly spoken earlier, in that mater too it will be truly unapt of you to make me blameworthy, as I spoke them in anguish and ignorance. [4-18-46, 47a]"
4-18-45,"You alone are the knower of recourses and their real nature, namely probity, prosperity, pleasure seeking, and emancipation; <font color="" #B3003A""><em>dharma, artha, kaama, moksha</em></font> ; and you take delight in the welfare of subjects, and your faultless intellect is clear in accomplishing ends by judging the causes and effects. [4-18-47b, c]"
4-18-46,"Oh, Rama, the knower of probity, I am the one who digressed from the rightness and a forerunner among such transgressors, such as I am, give absolution even to me with words abounded with rightness. Vali is thus saying to Rama. [4-18-48]"
4-18-47,"Vali who like an elephant plumped in slough continued to say slowly, with tears fully impeding his throat and with an agonised moan, on keenly observing Rama. [4-18-49]"
4-18-48,"Also, I neither worry for myself, nor for Tara, nor even for any relatives of mine, as I do for my son Angada, the best-virtuous one with golden bicep-lets. [4-18-50]"
4-18-49,"Right from his childhood I fondly looked after Angada, and he will be dejected when he sees me no more, and he withers away like a lake with its water drained for a drink. [4-18-51]"
4-18-50,"He is boyish, juvenile, and the only dear son of mine, oh, Rama, as such that great-mighty son of Tara needs your protection. [4-18-52]"
4-18-51,"You have firm convictions about practicable and impracticable procedures, and you alone are the protector of the good and punisher of the bad, hence treat both Sugreeva and Angada with equal compassion. [4-18-53]"
4-18-52,"Oh, lord of men, it will be apt of you to show the same kind of outlook towards Sugreeva, oh, king, even towards Angada, which you have for Bharata and Lakshmana. [4-18-54]"
4-18-53,"The fault occurring from my fault of maltreating Sugreeva may not light upon that self-reproachful Tara, and it will be apt of you to see that Sugreeva will not look down on her treating her as the wife his rival. [4-18-55]"
4-18-54,"When you indeed approve someone, he is capable enough to govern the kingdom, abiding himself under your control and following your heart, why a kingdom, he can rule the earth, why earth, he can even achieve the heaven itself. [4-18-56, 57a]"
4-18-55,"Though Tara dissuaded me I met with my brother Sugreeva in a duel as though aspiring elimination at your hand.. On saying thus to Rama that vanara, Vali the lord of monkeys&#39; paused for a while. [4-18-57b, 58]"
4-18-56,"Rama consoled Vali with words that are agreeable to savants and that contain the essence and meaning of rightness, while Vali is with an evincible perspective of righteousness by now. And Rama spoke to Vali this way. [4-18-59]"
4-18-57,"Oh, fly-jumper, you need not be remorseful about your wife, son and others you leave behind, because we take care of them... nor you should bother about us thinking that we have arbitrarily eliminated you, nor necessarily bother about yourself for committing sins, as we took this decision according to rightness and considerateness in your respect. [4-18-60]"
4-18-58,"He who administers punishment to the punishable, and he who is punishable and gets punished, both of them will achieve the results of cause and effect, where punishment is the effect from the cause of wrongdoing, and they both thereby will not be condemned. [4-18-61]"
4-18-59,"Thereby, by virtue of the punishment you are completely divested of your blemish, and as contained in the scriptures on rightness you attained your true nature, that which is agreeable to rightness. [4-18-62]"
4-18-60,"Let distress, desire and even dread that abide in your heart be discarded, oh, monkey&#39;s supreme, you cannot possibly transcend destiny. [4-18-63]"
4-18-61,"As Angada has always been conducting himself with you, thus he will conduct himself with Sugreeva and also even with me, without doubt. Thus Rama spoke to Vali. [4-18-64]"
4-18-62,"On hearing the agreeable and assertive words of that great-souled Rama, who is the treader on the path of rightness and an absolute crusher of enemies in war, Vali, the vanara, spoke these well-disposed words to Rama. [4-18-65]"
4-18-63,"Oh, lord, oh, tremendously braving one, oh, Rama, the lord of people, I blamed you when your arrow sweltered and rendered me imbecile, thus I blamed you unthinkingly for which I may please be pardoned, I appease you for the same. [4-18-66]"
4-19-1,"That great vanara king Vali who is sprawling agonised by arrow, and to whom Rama gave a reply with well-reasoned words did not find any other reply to be given to Rama. [4-19-1]"
4-19-2,"He who is heavily thrashed with trees, whose limbs are variously cracked with boulders, and whom Rama&#39;s arrow finally vanquished, that Vali fainted at the time of his breathing his last. [4-19-2]"
4-19-3,"Tara, wife of Vali, heard that the tigerly monkey Vali perished in fight by the arrow released by Rama."
4-19-4,"On hearing the very gruesome killing of her husband that is unpleasant, she is highly anguished and rushed out of Kishkindha along with Angada. [4-19-4]"
4-19-5,"On seeing Rama with bow those very mighty vanara-s that form the escort of Angada are scared to death, and they very quickly fled from there towards Kishkindha. [4-19-5]"
4-19-6,"Then on her way towards field of combat she saw the monkeys that are frightened and fleeing in disorder, like those animals that have wandered off from their herd when their master is killed. [4-19-6]"
4-19-7,"Nearing those monkeys that are already distressed at the fall of Vali, and that are highly frightened by Rama, and that are fleeing as though Rama&#39;s arrow is still tracking them down, Tara spoke to all of them, distressed as she is. [4-19-7]"
4-19-8,"Oh! Vanara-s, what for you are running away in utter fright and desperation, leaving off your best king to whom all of you are ushers? Thus Tara enquired with the monkeys. [4-19-8]"
4-19-9,"Whether or not a cruel brother made his brother to fall for the reason of kingdom with the arrows of Rama which can surge well from distance and fall on distant target? Aver it. [4-19-9]"
4-19-10,"On hearing the words of monkey&#39;s wife those guise-changing monkeys spoke this sentence coherently to lady Tara, befitting to present time of chaos. [4-19-10]"
4-19-11,"Return, oh, lady with a living son, and safeguard Angada, for the Terminator in the form of Rama is taking away Vali on killing. [4-19-11]"
4-19-12,"Shattering trees and massive boulders that Vali hurled at him with thunderbolt like arrows Rama felled Vali as if by thunderbolt. [4-19-12]"
4-19-13,"When that tigerly fly-jumper Vali whose brilliance is similar to Indra is killed all this vanara force felt defenceless and fled. [4-19-13]"
4-19-14,"Let the city of Kishkindha be safeguarded and let Angada be anointed, and when Vali&#39;s son Angada is enthroned all the fly-jumpers will stand by him. [4-19-14]"
4-19-15,"Or, your staying here is not good, oh, one with a pleasant visage, for those monkeys of Sugreeva will promptly enter our strongholds on this day itself. [4-19-15]"
4-19-16,"There are foresters in Kishkindha, some with wives and some without, some hankering after wives, some whom we have victimised, and from them we have very great danger. So said monkeys to Tara. [4-19-16]"
4-19-17,"On going a small distance ahead after listening those words, she whose smile will be winsome, that lady Tara said this befitting to her personality. [4-19-17]"
4-19-18,"Of what avail is a son, or a kingdom, or I to myself when my husband that lion like monkey with great honour perished. [4-19-18]"
4-19-19,"I wish to consign myself at the base of foot of that great-soul, who is felled down by the arrow projected by Rama. So said Tara to fleeing monkeys. [4-19-19]"
4-19-20,"Saying thus she started to wail and convulse in agony, and slapped her head and chest with both of her hands while she speedily rushed towards Vali. [4-19-20]"
4-19-21,"While she is still trudging then she saw her husband who is the destroyer of arch-demons like Maayaavi and Dundubhi, and who never retreated in combats, but now fallen down on ground. [4-19-21]"
4-19-22,"She saw Vali who is a flinger of loftiest mountains as with Indra flinging his thunderbolt, who is a blaster as with great gusty winds, and who is a roarer as with a cluster of great black-clouds. [4-19-22]"
4-19-23,"He who equals Indra in the invasion of enemies, a violent thunderer at the opponent thunderers, a brave one felled by still brave one, and who is like a best animal killed by a tiger for the purpose of flesh, and quietened like black-cloud at the end of downpour, At him she saw. [4-19-23]"
4-19-24,"He who is like a sanctum that is hitherto worshipped by all people, that is decorated with flags and demarcated with podia, but just ravaged by an eagle for the sake of a snake which sneaked into that sanctum, and Tara saw such a Vali plumped on the ground. [4-19-24]"
4-19-25,"She saw Rama standing and abutting on his very powerful bow, and his younger brother Lakshmana, even at the younger brother of her husband, namely Sugreeva. [4-19-25]"
4-19-26,"Going past them she reached her husband who is routed in combat, and on observing him closely she indeed fell down on earth as she is distraught and dumbfounded. [4-19-26]"
4-19-27,"On getting up as though reawakened from sleep she saw her husband bound fast by the strings of death, and then she wailingly addressed him as, oh, nobleman&#39;s son... [4-19-27]"
4-19-28,"On observing her who is wailing like a female osprey, and even on looking at Angada who arrived there, a miserable remorse came upon Sugreeva. [4-19-28]"
4-20-1,"On seeing her husband felled to ground with a terminator like arrow released byRama, that resentful lady Tara whose face is lovely like the moon, reached and embraced him.[4-20-1]"
4-20-2,"Tara is agonised when she saw the elephantine and mountainous vanara, namely Vali,reduced to no more than an uprooted tree, and she wailed fretfully with grief scorching heart.[4-20-2b, 3]"
4-20-3,"Oh, stern one in fights, oh, victorious one, oh, best valiant, oh, best flier, Ihave never blamed you either in your presence or in your absence, why do not you talk to me now?[4-20-4]"
4-20-4,"Arise, oh, tigerly monkey, you have to make use of a best bed as best kings willnot on repose on soil in this way, isn't it. [4-20-5]"
4-20-5,"The earth seems to be a highly cherished darling of yours, oh, lord of the land, asyou still embrace her with your limbs leaving me off, even when your lives are drained.[4-20-6]"
4-20-6,"It is evident that you, who conduct yourself righteously, must have built aKishkindha-like delightful city in the pathway to heaven by your leaving lovely Kishkindha.[4-20-7]"
4-20-7,"You bring an end to the pleasure trips you made along with us in the sweet smellingforests from time to time by your departing. [4-20-8]"
4-20-8,"When this fifth state betiding you, oh, great chief of chiefs of monkeys, I amdejected, despaired and drowned in the sea of sadness. [4-20-9]"
4-20-9,"My heart is very sturdy - perhaps, even on seeing you slain and fallen to ground,it is not splintering now into thousand splints, though it is tormented by sorrow. [4-20-10]"
4-20-10,"By which reason you have snatched away Sugreeva's wife, oh, chief of fliers, andeven expelled him from Kishkindha, that is the reason why you got this result. [4-20-11]"
4-20-11,"I am she who said a beneficial word to you with an interest in your well-being andwishing your welfare, but oh, best monkey, you unmindfully brushed me off. [4-20-12]"
4-20-12,"Oh, endower of honour, apsara-s, the celestial dancers, will be proud of theirbeauty, youthfulness, and expertise in romance, and oh, honourable one, you can stir up theirhearts towards you by your gallantry, definite is that. [4-20-13]"
4-20-13,"The Time which is an undoubtable factor in respect of anybody has ended your life,definite is that, and that Time alone perforce brought you, who are otherwise an uncontrollableforce, to the control of Sugreeva."
4-20-14,"The Death / Time no doubt has a concern with anyone for it is the ender of life, anddefinitely it chanced upon you by the capability of Sugreeva in getting support of Rama, andSugreeva alone controlled you, who are otherwise an uncontrollable force. [4-20-14]"
4-20-15,"Rama's killing Vali when he is fighting with another is unbefitting in its method,and he too is not at all worried for doing such a highly deplorable deed. [4-20-15]"
4-20-16,"So far I am not doleful or saddened, but now as a desolate seethed by sorrow I haveto undergo widowhood and dolefulness. [4-20-16]"
4-20-17,"My Angada is raised fondly, a brave one with gracefulness and one who is accustomedto comforts, but which will be the predicament he has to undergo when his paternal-uncle Sugreevagets into a fit of fury. [4-20-17]"
4-20-18,"Oh, son Angada, clearly see your father, a patron of virtue, oh, boy, later it isimpossible to catch a glimpse of him. Thus Tara said to her son Angada. [4-20-18]"
4-20-19,"You have started towards other world, isn't it, so reassure your son, kiss goodbyeon his forehead, and give me your parting messages. So said Tara to Vali. [4-20-19]"
4-20-20,"Really, Rama has not only done a great deed of hitting you down, but he alsoachieved indebtedness towards Sugreeva, both in a single promise. [4-20-20]"
4-20-21,"Now, you are to your heart's content Sugreeva as you regain your wife Ruma, you mayeven wallow in the kingdom unworriedly as your enemy-brother is silenced. So said Tara toSugreeva. [4-20-21]"
4-20-22,"Oh, lord of monkeys, why do not you talk to me, the dear wife of yours, when I amprattling at length, by the way, several of your comely wives are here, they are here, see them.""Thus Tara lamented. [4-20-22]"
4-20-23,"On listening Tara's lamentation the vanara females that are around became plaintive,saddened pitiably and wept piteously embracing Angada. [4-20-23]"
4-20-24,"Oh, one with bracelets on your mighty arms, why you are going to an eternal abodeleaving your dear son Angada? Your going away leaving such a son, who possesses best aptitudes thatcomes close to your abilities, and the one who always wears an exquisitely pleasant getup, isunbefitting. [4-20-24]"
4-20-25,"If I have done any undesirable deed in an indiscriminate way, even in the least, Imay be pardoned for that, and here I bow down at your feet... oh, masterful one... oh, the lord ofmonkeys lineage... oh, brave one... [Thus Tara wept for Vali.] [4-20-25]"
4-20-26,"That Tara with her unblemished complexion is seated in the close proximity of herhusband along with other vanara females, and weeping pitiably in that way, she decided toself-immolate, and thus she flounced down onto ground where Vali is slouching. [4-20-26]"
4-21-1,"Hanuma, the leader of monkeys, then neared and slowly consoled Tara who has fallen to ground like a star from sky. [4-21-1]"
4-21-2,"Living beings on doing the deeds of merit or demerit, or knowingly or unknowingly, will derive the resultant fruits of those deeds according to one&#39;s own destiny even after demise, and they shall bear them unrepentantly, may they be provident or improvident... [4-21-2]"
4-21-3,"Of which lamentable one you lament while you yourself are in a lamentable state? Of which pitiable one you take pity while you yourself are in a pitiable condition? Who is pitiable by whom in these bubbles like bodies? [4-21-3]"
4-21-4,"You are the one with a living son, and you have to look after this young one Angada, and you have to think of the forthcoming activities for his well-being and for his performance of duty towards his father. [4-21-4]"
4-21-5,"You are aware that the coming and going of beings, in their subtle forms of earth, water, fire, air and space into this mortal life and back is uncertain, thereby the prudent ones have to perform auspicious worldly deeds here in this world, say, the funeral of Vali. [4-21-5]"
4-21-6,"In whom hundreds and thousands of monkeys are harboured and astir, for they have reposed their confidence in him alone, that Vali has arrived at his end. [4-21-6]"
4-21-7,"By which reason this Vali conducted himself judiciously, observing friendliness, courteousness and forgivingness, by that reason alone Vali is going to a domain in heavens which he righteously conquered for himself, and it is unapt of your sorrowing for him. [4-21-7]"
4-21-8,"All the tigerly-monkeys, oh, impeccable Tara, including this son of yours Angada, and all the lords of monkeys and bears have their guardian angel in you. [4-21-8]"
4-21-9,"Oh, lady, inspirit these two, Sugreeva and Angada, that are searing in grief, and if you acquiesce then this Angada will rule over the earth. [4-21-9]"
4-21-10,"Whatever duty anticipated from a male descendent towards his father, and whatever activity that is to be done presently in respect of the dying king, let them be done, and that would be a timely decision. [4-21-10]"
4-21-11,"Cremation of the king of monkeys and anointment of Angada are the present time affairs, and seeing your son invested on the throne you can obtain peace. Thus spoke Hanuma to Tara. [4-21-11]"
4-21-12,"On hearing Hanuma&#39;s words she who is tormented by the plight of her husband, that Tara replied Hanuma who is standing nearby. [4-21-12]"
4-21-13,"Let there be a hundred selfsame Angada-s on one side, and this brave one the other, for me embracing him who is put to death is the best .... [4-21-13]"
4-21-14,"Who am I either for conducting the monkeys kingdom or to anoint Angada when Angada&#39;s paternal-uncle Sugreeva is close at hand? [4-21-14]"
4-21-15,"Hanuma, this thinking of yours that Angada is to be crowned is really untenable, oh, best monkey, father is the real defender of a son, but not the mother. [4-21-15]"
4-21-16,"Indeed there is nothing highly befitting to me, either in this world or in the other, than the auspices of the king of monkeys, and now to me the only befitting thing is to join in this brave one on this death bed, which he is adoring when put to death while he is facing away. [4-21-16]"
4-22-1,"With his life-force slowing down Vali respired slowly glancing everywhere, and hefirstly saw his brother Sugreeva afore him. [4-22-1]"
4-22-2,"Vali nodding at Sugreeva, who achieved triumph and became the lord of fly-jumpers,amicably spoke this to him in an unambiguous tone. [4-22-2]"
4-22-3,"Sugreeva, reckon me not by my iniquities, but reckon as one who is all the whileforcibly hauled into this futurity owing to my impropriety and obduracy. [4-22-3]"
4-22-4,"I do not think that we two are fated to share blissfulness simultaneously, oh, boy,therefore the amity seemly to brothers has cropped up otherwise. [4-22-4]"
4-22-5,"You realize that I am going to the abode of Time-god now itself, and hence proposeyourself as king of this forest-dweller's kingdom, now itself. [4-22-5]"
4-22-6,"Such as I am, I am indeed forgoing my life, kingdom, and this immense prosperityand even the unenviable glory which adduces that 'Vali is unkillable,' right away. [4-22-6]"
4-22-7,"Oh, valiant Sugreeva, it will be apt of you to make happen the word I am going tosay even in such a situation in which now I am, and oh, king, even if that word of mine isinfeasible. [4-22-7]"
4-22-8,"Have a look at this Angada, who is privileged for all happiness, brought up in allcomforts, though a boy he is mannerly, and who with his tear-filled face fallen onto ground.[4-22-8]"
4-22-9,"More dear than my own lives is my son, and when he is deprived of me you have tofoster him as if he is your own son, with no resources becoming sparse in every way. [4-22-9]"
4-22-10,"Oh, king of fly-jumpers, as with me you too are his father, patron, an overallprotector from all sides, and also thus an assurer in fear. [4-22-10]"
4-22-11,"This admirable son of Tara is a coequal of yours in triumphs, and in eliminatingthose demons he will be in your advance guard. [4-22-11]"
4-22-12,"This mighty and sinewy son of Tara is youthful, and on overtaking in war thisAngada will undertake actions seemly for a son of mine. [4-22-12]"
4-22-13,"In deciding meanings in all their subtleties and also in presages of diverse naturethis daughter of Sushena, Tara, is an insightful one in every way. [4-22-13]"
4-22-14,"Whatever is said by her as proper that is doable indubitably, indeed nothingcontrary happens to her opinions, in the least. [4-22-14]"
4-22-15,"You have to accomplish Raghava's mission undoubtedly, and if it is unaccomplishedthere will be infraction on your part because you befriended him before an altar of fire, and youmay even be punished for dishonouring him and your given word to him. [4-22-15]"
4-22-16,"The bounteous goddess of triumph ensconced in this golden pendant will completelyleave it off on my death, avoiding the flaw of touching a corpse, isn't it... hence oh, Sugreeva,you wear it. Thus Vali spoke to Sugreeva. [4-22-16]"
4-22-17,"Thus, that way when Vali spoke to Sugreeva with brotherly kind-heartedness, Sugreevaagain waned away forgoing his spiritedness, like the lord of stars, namely the Moon, when eatenaway by the planet, namely Rahu, during lunar eclipse. [4-22-17]"
4-22-18,"Quietened by Vali's words and conducting himself befittingly and attentively in thegiven situation, Sugreeva has then taken that golden chain only when Vali authorised him.[4-22-18]"
4-22-19,"On giving away that golden pendant, and on seeing his son who is available nearby,readying himself towards his end that is setting in, Vali affectionately spoke to Angada.[4-22-19]"
4-22-20,"From now on, observing time and place you have to tolerate pain or pleasure, enduremirth or misery on your going under the control of Sugreeva. [4-22-20]"
4-22-21,"Oh dextrous Angada, as to how I have entertained you in whichever way you conductedyourself with me, Sugreeva may not approve of such a puerile behaviour of yours, if you resort toit. [4-22-21]"
4-22-22,"Do not reach at his unfriendly ones, nor come near his enemies, oh, enemy-destroyerAngada, you shall be in the control of Sugreeva attending to the purposes of your lord withself-control. [4-22-22]"
4-22-23,"Do not conduct yourself with excessive friendliness or unfriendliness, as this pairof opposites itself has a flaw, therefore you cultivate an intermediary outlook. Vali thus spoketo Angada. [4-22-23]"
4-22-24,"He who is highly tortured by the arrow of Rama spoke to Angada in that way, andafterwards his eyeballs rolled-up, mouth hung open baring his horrid teeth, and his life too tookto flight from his body. [4-22-24]"
4-22-25,"Then, all those best monkeys avaialble there have started to weep when their monkeychief is dead, and for that matter they have loudly squawked at his death in this way.[4-22-25]"
4-22-26,"When the lord of monkeys departed to heaven Kishkindha is indeed rendered derelict,dreary are the gardens, deserted are the mountains and forests as well, and when the tiger amongfly-jumpers is dead all the vanara-s are rendered up into a lacklustre life. [4-22-26, 27a]"
4-22-27,"And by the impetus of whose great rapidity flowers available in forests andwoodlands used to shower on him in torrents and enwreathe him from behind, that Vali is no more,and now who has got such an impetus? [4-22-27b, 28a]"
4-22-28,"By which great-souled Vali a ferocious duel was given to the celestial, namely thegreat armed Golabha, which did not cease either in the daytime or night till Vali felled Golabha,that Vali is no more. [4-22-28b, 29]"
4-22-29,"Thereafter, in the sixteenth year Vali unquestionably felled Golabha, and onkilling that evil-minded Golabha with his zigzag teeth Vali accorded fearlessness to all of us, howsuch a Vali is felled now? Thus the monkeys raised hue and cry. [4-22-30]"
4-22-30,"But when that fly-jumper's brave lord Vali is killed, those fly-jumpers have goneinto a freneticness in that matter of Vali's killing, as with the cows becoming frenetic when theirhusbanding bull is killed while moving in a great forest that is riddled with a lion. [4-22-31]"
4-22-31,"But then Tara, whelmed under a ocean called affliction closely observed her deadhusband's face, embraced him and collapsed onto ground as with any creeper plant when the gianttree on which it is hinging is hacked down. [4-22-32]"
4-23-1,"Then that renowned Tara closely whiffed that face of monkey&#39;s king Vali and spoke these words to her dead husband. [3-23-1]"
4-23-2,"Heedless of my word, oh, brave one, you are reposing miserably on a very rough and uneven ground spread with stones. [3-23-2]"
4-23-3,"This earth must definitely be your beloved one, oh, best of monkeys, why because, you still embrace her while you recline on her, without replying me. [3-23-3]"
4-23-4,"You have gone into the control of Sugreeva and Sugreeva alone triumphed, oh, brave one, oh, enthusiast in adventures, oho, is it fated to happen this way. [3-23-4]"
4-23-5,"These chiefs of bears and monkeys are adoring you in every respect as their most worshipful one, and on hearing their despairing wailing, and the lamentation of Angada, and even these utterance of mine in keen, why do not you comeback to senses. [3-23-5, 6a]"
4-23-6,"Do you wish to repose on the very daybed on which you have laid your enemies to rest when you have once felled them in fights, or what? [3-23-6b, 7a]"
4-23-7,"Oh, successor of a clan with pristine calibre, oh, accorder of dignity, oh, devotee of fighting, oh, my dear, have you gone on leaving me without a protector and lonely? [3-23-7b, 8a]"
4-23-8,"Really considerate fathers shall never propose brides to adventurers, they say. Yes! See me the wife of an adventurer, in a trice rendered as a war-widow left in the lurch. [3-23-8b, 9a]"
4-23-9,"My honour is degenerated and my eternal happiness is disintegrated, and I am deluged in an abyssal boundless ocean called anguish. [3-23-9b, 10a]"
4-23-10,"And dense with metallic substance is this heart of mine in its solidity, since it is not splintering into hundredfold even on seeing my husband killed, it is definite. [3-23-10b, 11a]"
4-23-11,"By your nature you are my beloved, besides, you are a good-hearted one, more so, you are my husband, moreover, you are a valiant triumphing over your enemies in assaults, such as you are you have attained the fifth state, the death. [3-23-11b, 12a]"
4-23-12,"Perhaps a woman might have mothered many children, and perhaps affluent with riches and crops, still people will call her a widow, if she is without husband. [3-23-12b, 13a]"
4-23-13,"How do you repose now on a sheet of blood flowing from your own body, oh, brave one, as if you are reclining on your own bed spread with a bed sheet of red blood colour? [3-23-13b, 14a]"
4-23-14,"I have no strength to closely embrace you with both my arms, oh, best fly-jumper, when the blood and dust covering your body comes in between. [3-23-14b, 15a]"
4-23-15,"Single arrow released by Rama has doubly benefited Sugreeva in this highly deplorable enmity between you and Sugreeva, as his ambition to become the king is fulfilled and his fear from your persecution, too, is evanished. [3-23-15b, 16a]"
4-23-16,"In vain, I have been watching you without a wink, on whom fatality has descended, as this arrow stuck in your chest is hindering me to embrace you... Thus wailed Tara. [3-23-16b, 17a]"
4-23-17,"Then the monkey chief Nila extricated that arrow which is stuck in the chest of Vali, as with the extraction of a firmly wedged sparkling snake from the cavity of a mound. [3-23-17b, 18a]"
4-23-18,"The sparkle of Rama&#39;s arrow while it is being extracted from Vali&#39;s chest is much the same as the sparkles of more brilliant sunrays that are extracted by the end of daytime, when the sun is sinking beyond the summit of dusky western mountain, and as contrasted with the hue of dusk. [3-23-18b, 19a]"
4-23-19,"The blood streams flown out of the gashes of Vali fell everywhere like the streams of water flowing from a mountain saturated with coppery mineral-ores. [3-23-19b, 20a]"
4-23-20,"On wiping off war dust with which her husband is muffled up, with tears gushing from her eyes she drenched that valiant one who is summarily hit by the missile of Rama. [3-23-20b, 21a]"
4-23-21,"On giving attention to all of the blood wet limbs of her slain husband that lady Tara spoke to her son Angada whose eyes are coppery-red. [3-23-21b, 22a]"
4-23-22,"See the highly harrowing end time plight of your father, oh, son, he reached his end owing to the enmity harnessed by sinful deeds. [3-23-22b, 23a]"
4-23-23,"To him, whose physical splendour vied with the dazzle of rising sun, to that father, king, and the accorder of honour you pay you last obeisance as he journeyed to the abode of Time-god. Thus Tara said to Angada. [3-23-23b, 24a]"
4-23-24,"When he is said so, Angada swiftly rose and touched the feet of his father with both of his rotund-shouldered sinewy arms saying, father, I am Angada... [3-23-24b, 25a]"
4-23-25,"Why do not you bless Angada saying, &#39;long live, son...&#39; when he is paying resects to you, as earlier? Thus Tara is addressing Vali in her anguish. [3-23-25b, 26a]"
4-23-26,"I am living through seeing the lifeless state of yours with the help of my son, no more than a helpless cow that sits near her bull with its calf, when that bull is slain by a lion, just now. [3-23-26b, c]"
4-23-27,"How can you singly take the ultimate bath of a Vedic ritual after your conducting a ritual like combat, in the waters called bloodstreams caused by Rama&#39;s arrow, that too, when I, your wife, am available like a co-officiator of a Vedic ritual? [3-23-27]"
4-23-28,"Now where is that treasured golden pendant of yours which the king of gods gave to you when he is satisfied with your conduct in wars, I don&#39;t see it? [3-23-28]"
4-23-29,"Majesty is not deserting you even if your lives have departed, oh, accorder of dignity, as with the sunshine that departs the sun while he circumnavigates Mt. Meru, which mount is supposed to overshadow everything by its vastness. [3-23-29]"
4-23-30,"Neither you heeded my word of expediency, nor I was indeed capable to forestall you, and I am doomed along with my son when you are exterminated in fight, whereby the Grace that forsook you, is deserting me too, in its entirety. [3-23-30]"
4-24-1,"A word about this chapter. The bardic tradition is in the habit of including everything, while the critical editions exclude anything arbitrary. This chapter is excluded in the critical editions, but traditional versions retained it, and all publications publish this. The scholars have also said that all the forty-four verses in here have no stamp of Valmiki, the verbiage and verbosity are heightened, even the meter is overfilled, and even the word positioning does not yield proper meaning. Even so, all are retained in all publications. However, it may be mentioned that if some Valmiki Jr. written and included this chapter, it should have been ages before, but not in the known ages, because Dharmaakuutam, Govindaraja and others have commentaries on chapter. In all the commentaries an exhaustive commentary is there on two verses uttered by Tara, which is included here also."
4-24-2,"On seeing Tara who quickly deluged in a speedy and vast ocean of intolerable anguish, then that Vali&#39;s mighty brother Sugreeva regretted for the killing of his matchless brother. [4-24-1]"
4-24-3,"While that kind hearted Sugreeva observed Tara for a moment he is despaired at heart, tears filled his face, and lamenting very much he slowly paced to the near of Rama, surrounded by his attendants. [4-24-2]"
4-24-4,"On approaching him who is majestic, who is still handling his bow and snake-like arrow, a distinguished person with all of his limbs adorned with great attributes that an emperor should have by birth, to such a Raghava who is standing nearby, Sugreeva spoke this way. [4-24-3]"
4-24-5,"As promised, oh, best king, you have accomplished this deed with its eventual fruition of getting back the kingdom and my wife, but now, oh, prince, my heart is backsliding from extravagances of kingdom and kingship, as my life itself is rendered despicable, for I got my brother killed. [4-24-4]"
4-24-6,"When the king is killed, this empress is wailing bitterly, much wailing is there in city scorched in sadness, and Angada too is in a doubtful state of sustaining his lives in the fond of his father, as such oh, Rama, my heart is not taking delight in kingdom. [4-24-5]"
4-24-7,"In the first instance I have agreed for the elimination of my brother owing to my anger, intolerance and as I was subjected to too much ignominy, but now, oh, best one from Ikshvaku-s, when the chief of monkeys Vali is put to death, I am painfully remorseful. [4-24-6]"
4-24-8,"I think it would be better for me to live on that best mountain Rishyamuka for ever in an as is where is condition, somehow spending life befitting to a monkey, and achieving even heaven on killing my brother is of no good. [4-24-7]"
4-24-9,"The words which he used to speak to me saying, &#39;I do not wish to kill you, begone...&#39; are befitting to that great-souled and rational vanara, and my words in asking you to him to kill him, and my deeds in getting him killed are befitting to me, as an irrational vanara. [4-24-8]"
4-24-10,"Indeed, oh, brave Rama, whether killing one&#39;s own brother will be self-torturous? Or, taking pleasure in kingdom on killing that brother will be more? Or, the distress ensuing that killing will be the most? Without truly discriminating these cruces, even if one has one&#39;s own own avarice in prospect, who is he that is going to take pleasure in killing his own highly honoured brother? Excepting me! [4-24-9]"
4-24-11,"Killing me is not in the intent of Vali violating his probity, but my intent has become evilly life taking, violating my own probity. [4-24-10]"
4-24-12,"I was whining for a time when Vali thrashed me with a tree branch, as if with a schoolmaster&#39;s cane, but later on comforting me he said this to me, &#39;do not do this again, this daring me to fight you back.&#39; [4-24-11]"
4-24-13,"Fraternity, dignity and also probity are conserved by him, while I exhibited furiousness, enviousness and also naughtiness of a monkey. [4-24-12]"
4-24-14,"As Indra acquired sin on killing Vishvarupa, the son of Tvastha, I too derived a sin by killing my brother, which sin is absolutely unimaginable for quantification, totally undesirable at any given time, wholly discardable by sagacious souls, and a disgustingly horrible spectre of brotherly hate. [4-24-13]"
4-24-15,"Earth, waters, trees and women took the burden of Indra&#39;s sins, but who in name will bear the burden of this sin of mine, that too the sin of a monkey, who wishes to share? [4-24-14]"
4-24-16,"On undertaking this sort of deed that includes unjust and involves ruination of one&#39;s own race, I am unsuited for this sort of accolade from the subjects of this kingdom, and when I am ineligible to be the price regent of this kingdom, wherefore to become its regent? [4-24-15]"
4-24-17,"In this world, I am a committer of a felony which is debased, highly damnable and pernicious to the world itself, whereupon this irresistible misery is rushing in on me, as with the rush of speeding rainy-waters towards a declivity. [4-24-16]"
4-24-18,"The sin of mine in killing my brother assumed a form of an elephant, where my sinister motives of killing my own brother have assumed that elephant&#39;s hind and tail, and my causing agony to my own brother has become that elephant&#39;s head, eyes, trunk, and tusks, with them that berserk and monstrous elephant called sin, is goring me as it would gore a riverbed. [4-24- 17]"
4-24-19,"How difficult is this insufferable sacrilege of mine, oh, best king, owing to which my good breeding is shed from my heart, as with the gold, which if alloyed will be intolerant of that filth, but oh, Raghava, even the gold sheds itself from scum when melted, and though I melt in grief this scum of sacrilege is unshed. [4-24-18]"
4-24-20,"I think this body of great-might monkey commanders is withstanding its lives in a halfway, oh, Raghava, just because of me and this Angada who is searing in anguish, for it is half-dead with the death of Vali. [4-24-19]"
4-24-21,"It is easy to get an easygoing and easy to deal with son, but where to get a son similar to Angada, oh, valiant Rama, also where to get even such a place wherein there will be an easy access to the nearness to one&#39;s own brother?"
4-24-22,"It is somehow easy to get a son who is an easygoing, easy to deal with like Angada in this world, but, oh, valiant Rama, where is the world wherein I can get Vali-like brother and wherein can be in his vicinity? [4-24-20]"
4-24-23,"This best of brave ones, Angada, will not live reft of his father, but his mother Tara has to live to foster her son Angada, but if Angada dies with his heartbroken for his farther, then without her son her misery will become miserable, and then she too may not live... this is my resolve. [4-24-21]"
4-24-24,"Such as I am, I wish to enter a highly blazing fire seeking amity with my departed brother and as well with son Angada, and these best valiant monkeys will search for Seetha duly conducting themselves under your control. [4-24-22]"
4-24-25,"Oh, prince, even if I am dead your mission will be achieved in its entirety, and oh, Rama, having perpetrated infraction I have become an eliminator of the propriety of our race, hence I have become an unworthy one to live, and hence permit me to commit myself to fire... Thus Sugreeva said to Rama. [4-24-23]"
4-24-26,"On hearing the anguished words of the younger brother of Vali, namely Sugreeva, the eyes of Rama, the best valiant one from Raghu&#39;s dynasty and the eliminator of valiant enemies, are moistened and he became perturbed for a moment. [4-24-24]"
4-24-27,"At that moment, Rama whose perseverance is like that of the earth and who is the protector of earth has seen Tara, who is wailing and repeatedly looking around as she is deluged in desperation, and then with all his concernedness Rama paced towards her. [4-24-25]"
4-24-28,"The prominent monkey ministers then started to raise her up, whose eyes are pleasant and intellect unfailing, and who had the lion among monkeys as her husband, but now collapsed on ground hugging her departed husband. [4-24-26]"
4-24-29,"She who is hugging her husband wriggled highly when she is disengaged from him, and at a particular stage she saw Rama with his bow and arrow in his hands and who is resplendent like sun, by his own resplendence. [4-24-27]"
4-24-30,"On seeing at him whose eyes are graceful, one endowed with all kingly attributes, who looked best among men, and who is unseen so far, that fawn-eyed Tara realized him alone as that Rama. [4-24-28]"
4-24-31,"She on whom misfortune has chanced and who is anguished, that noble lady Tara went very quickly with highly squirming movements to the near of the highly exalted soul Rama, who matches Indra in his valour and an unreachable one for his enemies. [4-24-29]"
4-24-32,"The body language of Tara which is so far disconcerted by the grief felt for Rama&#39;s perfect hitting, felling and achieving his object in war, namely Vali, is now disoriented to anger on seeing the very same Rama, as she is a self-respectful lady. But on arriving at the near of that very pure being Rama, that ireful body language of hers again reoriented itself to a sort of serenity, and then she spoke this to him. [4-24-30]"
4-24-33,"You are an indeterminable one, an inaccessible one, one with his self conquered, the supreme among righteous souls, your glory is unmitigated, and you are the one with clear discrimination, and in endurance earth-like, and your eyes are blood streaked like those of an emperor. [4-24-31]"
4-24-34,"You with your proportionate physic are a mighty one handling bows and arrows, but your bodily magnificence is more than that of magnificent humanly body. "
4-24-35,"You with your proportionate physic are a mighty one handling bows and arrows, but your bodily magnificence is more than that of magnificent humanly body. [4-24-32"
4-24-36,"Oh, brave one, kill me too with the same arrow with which you have killed my dear husband, and on getting killed at your hand I wish to reach his near, as Vali takes no delight without me. [4-24-33]"
4-24-37,"Though Vali with eyes like unblemished lotus petals reaches heaven he looks around for me, and not finding me there, he does not have a romance with celestial apsara-s though they will be in amazing costumes and wear red-coloured towering tiaras. [4-24-34]"
4-24-38,"Even though Vali is in heaven he will derive despair and despondency without me, like you, who are despondent and despaired on the pleasant stretches of mountainsides of that best mountain Rishyamuka, as you are without Seetha. [4-24-35]"
4-24-39,"How a virile person derives discomfort without his woman, that much you know, isn&#39;t it! Because you are aware of it, you kill me; let not Vali get any discomfort when he does not find me. [4-24-36]"
4-24-40,"Oh, prince, as a high souled one even if you think that, sin of killing a female will not befall on me? But deem me as his soul, as scriptures say that the wife is the soul of husband, and hence kill me, then there will not be any blemish of woman killing. [4-24-37]"
4-24-41,"In the course of implementing scriptural rituals, and even as contained in various Vedic sayings, wife is not a separate entity than her husband, and no better endowment than endowing a wife to an eligible bridegroom by bride&#39;s father is countenanced by the wise men in the world, isn&#39;t it. [4-24-38]"
4-24-42,"Even you, oh, valiant one, on examining good and bad bestow me to my dear husband, and by that way, oh, brave one, by such an endowment of a wife to her husband, by way of killing and sending her to her husband, you too will not get any touch of sin. [4-24-39]"
4-24-43,"Anguished and unprotected, such as I am, oh, king, I am being distracted from my departed husband by these Vanara misters, and it is unapt of you to not to kill me, as I am incapable to live without him, whose sprightly gait is like that of an elephant, a best one among fly-jumping Vanara-s, a courageous one, and who wears a precious and exquisite golden pendant... Thus Tara pleaded with Rama for a mercy-death. [4-24-40]"
4-24-44,"Thus that way when Tara spoke to that lord and great-souled Rama, Rama consoling Tara well, spoke this word of expediency, oh, wife of valiant one, let not your mind go raving, the Creator decreed all the world to be in this way, isn&#39;t so! [4-24-41]"
4-24-45,"And the same Creator has ordained mirth and misery , and even their association, so say sagely people. And even the triad of worlds is indeed under his control, and that triad too, cannot transgress the foreordained predestination. [4-24-42]"
4-24-46,"You will get paramount appeasement as before, and your son will become the crown prince, God has ordained destiny only in that way. Wives of the valiant ones will not mourn emotionally. Thus Rama consoled Tara. [4-24-43]"
4-24-47,"Thus consoled by that persuasive, noble-souled and enemy-burner Rama, that brave one&#39;s wife whose aspect is fair and whose attire is proper, she paused her plaint, but with a puling expression. [4-24-44]"
4-25-1,"While a similar disquiet of Sugreeva is prevailing over Rama and Lakshmana, Rama palliatively said this to Sugreeva, and even to Tara together with Angada. [4-25-1]"
4-25-2,"Deceased will not derive bliss by sorrowful mourning, hence it will be appropriate to arrange for that work which is subsequent in this matter. [4-25-2]"
4-25-3,"Worldly observances are to be observed, thus your activity of tear-shedding this far is justifiable, but after the lapse of time of any individual, it is impossible to activate that individual by any other remote activity like weeping."
4-25-4,"Worldly observances are to be observed, thus your activity of tear-shedding this far is justifiable, it is impossible to undertake any other ritual work if time is lapsed just by weeping. [4-25-3]"
4-25-5,"Fate is the cause of all the worlds, Fate is the instrument for action, Fate is the deciding factor for motivation of all beings in these worlds. [4-25-4]"
4-25-6,"None is an instrument in motivating someone else to do something or otherwise, none is also a controlling entity of others, and even the world functions in its own nature, and that Time is cardinal for that world. [4-25-5]"
4-25-7,"Time will not transcend Time, neither Time transgresses itself, and on attaining the nature endowed by Time nothing can overstep its own Fate. [4-25-6]"
4-25-8,"Time has no kinship, thus it has no partiality, there is nothing instrumental to override Time, hence nothing can override it, and there are no causative factors to Time that connect through friends or relatives, hence all are equal in its viewpoint. [4-25-7]"
4-25-9,"But even the mutations brought forth by Time are observable by a perceiver with a clear vision, and the virtue, wealth, pleasures are to be perceived as cumulated during the course of Time. [4-25-8]"
4-25-10,"That king of fly-jumpers Vali departed from here on attaining his own nature of subtle-soul, and he obtained pious fruits connected with his one time actions befitting to a king like, friendliness, courteousness, and forgivingness required of a king. [4-25-9]"
4-25-11,"That great-souled Vali did not care to safeguard his own lives in combat, and by virtue of his own rightness of a true combatant unworried of his life, he acquired heaven. [4-25-10]"
4-25-12,"Which course the commander of monkeys undertook is the choicest course of fatality, and hence, enough is this sorrowing, and let works incumbent on the present time be undertaken reverently... So said Rama to Sugreeva. [4-25-11]"
4-25-13,"At the close of Rama&#39;s sentence Lakshmana, the eliminator of braving foes, spoke this courteous sentence to the disconcerted Sugreeva. [4-25-12]"
4-25-14,"Sugreeva, you attend to the funeral rites, to be performed subsequently along with those two, Tara and Angada, and arrange for the cremation of Vali. [4-25-13]"
4-25-15,"Order at once for substantial dry firewood, likewise for finest sandalwood, for the purpose of the exequies of Vali. [4-25-14]"
4-25-16,"Bolster up that miserable Angada who is heartbroken, you too should not become frivolous in thinking as this city Kishkindha is now dependant on you. [4-25-15]"
4-25-17,"Let Angada bring wreaths, different cloths, ghee, oils, as well perfumes and other items that are consequently useful in funeral. [4-25-16]"
4-25-18,"And Lt. Tara, you go quickly and come readily fetching a palanquin of the dead, for despatch is a merit, which is truly worthwhile, especially at these times. [4-25-17]"
4-25-19,"Let suitable, proficient and sturdy Vaanara-s be at the ready as the bearers of the litter of the dead to carry away Vali. Thus said Lakshmana to Sugreeva. [4-25-18]"
4-25-20,"Speaking thus to Sugreeva that enhancer of his mother Sumitra&#39;s delight and the eliminator of braving foes, Lakshmana stepped off and stayed behind his brother Rama. [4-25-19]"
4-25-21,"On hearing the words of Lakshmana Lt. Tara&#39;s mood became hectic and he fleetly entered Kishkindha with his mood firmed up to get the litter of the dead. [4-25-20]"
4-25-22,"Lt. Tara came back in a trice fetching that litter of the dead, getting it carried by gritty and suitable Vanara-s. [4-25-21]"
4-25-23,"That palanquin is having a majestic throne and in similarity it is like a divine chariot which is adorned and beautified with figurines of birds and trees in high relief. From all over it is well set in with strikingly carved figures of foot soldiers, and it is like an aircraft of the gifted souls, namely siddha-s, with grills and ventilators. Well seamed-in are its parts and also spacious it is, and well crafted by the crafty craftsmen it has wooden play-hills carved in its walls, and finishing touches with a fine artistry of polishing are given to that palanquin. It is elaborated with best ornaments and strings of pearls, gems, beads and the like, and even with amazing flowery-tassels. Its cabin&#39;s roof is covered with an ornamental woodcraft of red-sandalwood. It is well covered over with lots of flowers, and in its shade it is like a tender sun, while garlands of red-lotuses are further brightening it. And Lt. Tara brought such a litter of the dead. [4-25-22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
4-25-24,"On seeing such a sort of palanquin Rama said to Lakshmana, Let Vali be taken away quickly and funeral ceremony be undertaken. [4-25-27]"
4-25-25,"Thereafter Sugreeva along with Angada and others lifted up and then lodged Vali in the litter of the dead squalling woefully. [4-25-28]"
4-25-26,"Thus setting that deceased Vali who is diversely decorated and adorned with garlands and cloths onto the palanquin, then Sugreeva, the king of best fly-jumpers, has ordered, let the funeral ceremony of this noble brother of mine be undertaken, befitting to his magnificence... [4-25-29, 30]"
4-25-27,"Let the vanara-s proceed in van strewing various gems plentifully, and the palanquin afterward... [4-25-31]"
4-25-28,"In which way the grandiose of monarchical opulence will be conspicuous on earth when kings decease, in a similar way the Vanara-s have to immortalise lord Vali now, Sugreeva ordered monkeys in that way. [4-25-32]"
4-25-29,"On performing services to the dead in the same way as ordered by Sugreeva, then all of those vanara-s like Lt. Tara and others, have promptly started out hemming round Angada, keening over their dead relative Vali. [4-25-33, 34a]"
4-25-30,"Then all the female adherents of Vali came together and wept saying, &#39;oh, brave one, oh, brave one...&#39; and they repeatedly wept thus for their departed dear. [4-25-34b, 35a]"
4-25-31,"Lady Tara and all other female Vanara-s, whose husband is dead, followed the funeral procession wailing in a pathetic tone. [4-25-35b, 36a]"
4-25-32,"With the din of wailing of those Vanara females in the interiors of the forest, that forest along with its hillocks appeared to be wailing noisily. [4-25-36b, 37a]"
4-25-33,"Many Vanara-s have arranged a funeral pile on an unpopulated sandy isle, around which brooks from the cascades of hills are encircling. [4-25-37b, 38a]"
4-25-34,"All of those best vanara-s then lifted down that palanquin from their shoulders and stood aside weltered in melancholy. [4-25-38b, 39a]"
4-25-35,"Lady Tara on seeing at her husband Vali recumbent on the bier of the litter of the dead, she then brought his head onto her lap, and wailed painfully. [4-25-39b, 40a]"
4-25-36,"O, great king of monkeys... o, my consort... my dear... o, meritorious one, o, mighty one, o, my dear... see me... why do not you see this grief-stricken creature, that is me... [4-25-40b, 41]"
4-25-37,"Though your lives have gone your face is appearing to be highly enchanting as if it has a similar dazzle of the sun on dusking mountain, as it had when you were alive. [4-25-42]"
4-25-38,"Time-god in the mien of this Rama is hauling you away, oh, vanara, on rendering all of us as widows by flinging a single arrow in the fight. [4-25-43]"
4-25-39,"These are those female vanara-s of yours, oh, best king, unable to come by leaping and jumping as they are wont to, they have come treading a much lengthy way of yours, why do not you mind them? They with their faces like moonshine are your cherished wives, isn&#39;t it! [4-25-44]"
4-25-40,"What for you are not seeing the lord of fly-jumpers Sugreeva, and these Lt. Tara and others are all your ministers, oh, king, and even the people dwelling in Kishkindha city have gathered around you and sinking down, why do not you mind them? [4-25-45b, 46]"
4-25-41,"Bid adieu to these ministers as usual, oh, enemy subjugator, then we all can sportfully wander in the woods in voluptuousness. Thus Tara mourned for Vali. [4-25-47]"
4-25-42,"While Tara is enwrapped in the grief for her husband and wailing that way, then other female Vanara-s, who are equally haggard by grief have lifted her up and took her away from the body of Vali. [4-25-48]"
4-25-43,"Angada wailing along with Sugreeva, started to mount his father&#39;s body onto pyre in an involuntary way, as his senses are deluged under grief. [4-25-49]"
4-25-44,"On giving fire to the pyre procedurally, then Angada with dismayed senses performed circumambulations in an anticlockwise direction to his father, who is voyaging on a remote avenue. [4-25-50]"
4-25-45,"On cremating Vali procedurally those best fly-jumpers arrived at the propitious river with auspicious waters to offer water oblations to the departed soul. [4-25-51]"
4-25-46,"Those vanara-s on coming together along with Sugreeva and Lady Tara, and then locating Angada in their front, they have offered water oblations to the soul of Vali. [4-25-52]"
4-25-47,"He whose sadness evened up with that of Sugreeva, and who became one with Sugreeva in haplessness, that great mighty Rama effectuated the funeral rites of Vali. [4-25-53]"
4-25-48,"On cremating Vali of lofty aplomb and manifest-renown and whom the arrow of that Rama, the best of Ikshvaku dynasty has eliminated, Sugreeva then approached that Rama, who is with Lakshmana at his side, and whose flair equals a flaming fire. [4-25-54]"
4-26-1,"The eminent ministers of tree-branch animals then surrounded Sugreeva, who is very much seared in grief and who is still wearing damp cloths, as he just a while ago offered watery oblations to his deceased brother, stood accessible to him. [4-26-1]"
4-26-2,"On going towards the dexterous Rama, whose exploits are effortless, all of those monkeys tarried with their palms adjoined as with the sages tarrying in the presence of Brahma, the Forefather. [4-26-2]"
4-26-3,"Hanuma, the son of Air-god, whose sheen is like that of the golden mountain Meru, and whose visage is like that of the tender sun in its glint, then spoke this sentence reverently adjoining his palms. [4-26-3]"
4-26-4,"Oh, lord Rama, this magnificent kingdom of deferential monkeys who are armed with the teeth, and whose might is a privileged one - since our might is not dependent on any weapons or other tactical warfare, except our own bodily strength - and oh, Kakutstha, that which belongs to his father and forefathers, and that which is otherwise impossible for him to regain, Sugreeva regained such a kingdom with your grace. [4-26-4, 5a]"
4-26-5,"And if you empower, this Sugreeva will enter the propitious city Kishkindha along with a group good-hearted friends, and he will get anointed procedurally with various essences and herbal-extracts as its king, and thus he can revamp all the administration. [4-26-5b, 6]"
4-26-6,"He would like to honour you in a remarkable way with garlands and precious gems, hence it will be apt of you to enter this delightful mountain cave, namely Kishkindha, and you may kindly consolidate the congenial affinity between the governor and the governed for the very high exhilaration of Vanara-s. Hanuma appealed Rama in this way. [4-26-7, 8a]"
4-26-7,"When Hanuma said so, Rama the destroyer of valiant foes, an intellectual and an enunciator replied Hanuma in this way. [4-26-8b, 9a]"
4-26-8,"As a conformist to the directives of my father, oh, gentle Hanuma, I am not supposed to enter either a village or a city. [4-26-9b, 10a]"
4-26-9,"As and when the best one among Vanara-s valorous Sugreeva enters the highly flourishing and statuesquely Kishkindha, he shall be enthroned in the kingdom, immediately and procedurally. [4-26-10b, 11a]"
4-26-10,"Replying Hanuma thus, that knower of the etiquette Rama, also spoke to Sugreeva, who is rich in politesse and an imposing one by his might and valour. [4-26-11b, 12a]"
4-26-11,"You may even crown this brave Angada as crown prince, he is the eldest son of your elder brother, his bravery is kindred to that of his father, and thus this enthusiastic Angada will be a well-chosen designee for the crown-princeship. [4-26-12b, 13]"
4-26-12,"The four month period specified for rainy season has commenced, oh gentle Sugreeva, and this is shravaNa, the first month of rainy season that brings many showers. [4-26-14]"
4-26-13,"This is not a time for any striving, hence you enter the propitious city Kishkindha, oh, gentle Sugreeva, and I for my part will stay on this mountain along with Lakshmana. [4-26-15]"
4-26-14,"This mountain cave is heart-pleasing by being spacious with worthwhile breeze, oh, gentle one, water is copious and red and blue lotuses are aplenty about this place. [4-26-16]"
4-26-15,"On the advent of <em>kaartika</em> month, October, say post-rainy season, you shall do your best in the cause of Ravana&#39;s elimination, and this is our covenant, and hence oh, gentle Sugreeva, for now enter your mansion, be enthroned in kingdom as well, and exhilarate your friends. [4-26-17, 18a]"
4-26-16,"Thus when Rama countenanced that best vanara Sugreeva entered the charming city Kishkindha which is so far ruled by Vali. [4-26-18b, 19a]"
4-26-17,"When the sovereign of vanara-s Sugreeva has entered the city, very gladly thousands of vanara-s have also entered and fenced off that lord of fly-jumpers from all over. [4-26-19b, 20a]"
4-26-18,"All the inmates and ministers in Kishkindha then revered the lord of monkey throngs Sugreeva with their head-bent, and they have also prostrated before him with an assiduously polite attitude. [4-26-20b, 21a]"
4-26-19,"Raising the rank-and-file members from their prostration, and on exchanging a word or two with them, that valiant and highly mighty Sugreeva entered the beautiful palace-chambers of his brother. [4-26-21b, 22a]"
4-26-20,"When that prodigiously venturesome arch-vanara Sugreeva has entered the palace his cohorts anointed him as gods would anoint the Thousand-eyed Indra. [4-26-22b, 23a]"
4-26-21,"A white parasol highly ornate in gold, long-furred royal-fans with golden handles that are the enhancers of celebrity are brought for Sugreeva&#39;s anointment. Likewise, on taking all kinds of jewels, seeds, herbs, sprouts of trees that are still exuding milky latex, also flowers, and white royal-robes and white body-cream, lotuses bloomed on dry-land, best sandal paste, also various and numerous perfumes, Holy-yellow-rice, gold, seeds that are small and fragrant called priyangu, honey, ghee, curds, skin of tiger, tassels of fragrant flowers, and invaluable sandal shoes, unguents before oil bath, orpiment preparations one in yellow called gorochana, and the other in red called Manshila, there arrived sixteen best and cheerful damsels. [4-26-23b, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"
4-26-22,"They the Vanara-s have then started to anoint that best Vanara Sugreeva according to the tradition, having appeased the eminent Brahmans with jewels, garments and delicacies. [4-26-29]"
4-26-23,"Authoritative scholars in Vedic-hymns then spreading the ritual grass around the Fire-altar which is with enkindled Ritual-fire oblated fire oblations into it duly sanctifying them with hymns. [4-26-30]"
4-26-24,"On a splendid, choicest and finely upholstered throne with golden legs that is kept atop a rostrum that is shining forth with various flower tassels, Sugreeva is procedurally inducted to sit facing east to the chanting of Vedic hymns. Then, Vanara-s like Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, Mainda, Dvividha, also thus Hanuma, Jambavanta have started pouring pure water on Sugreeva, which the best vanara-s have collected from the rivers flowing to east, as well as to west, from each of the sacred-declivity of rivers, from every ocean, and stored in golden flasks. Thus those have anointed Sugreeva with those pellucid and well-perfumed waters poured from golden vessels through the auspicious horns of bulls as revealed in scriptures and as great sages have defined, which anointment is like eight of Vasu-gods anointing the Thousand-eyed Indra. [4-26-31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
4-26-25,"Hundreds and thousands of the great-souled and prominent vanara-s that are there, all of them have cheerily raised high hullabaloos while Sugreeva is anointed. [4-26-37]"
4-26-26,"The best one among monkeys Sugreeva graciously embraced Angada and anointed his as crown prince in order to effectuate Rama&#39;s word. [4-26-38]"
4-26-27,"On the anointment of Angada those fly-jumpers that have sympathy for him have acclaimed Sugreeva saying, &#39;well done, well done.&#39; [4-26-39]"
4-26-28,"While that kind of pompous anointment is taking place all are gladdened and that way they repeatedly extolled the great-souled Rama, and even Lakshmana too. [4-26-40]"
4-26-29,"That magnificent city Kishkindha situated in the cave of mountain which is already splendorous with flags of triumph and banners is further splendorous with blithe and burly monkeys overspreading it. [4-26-41]"
4-26-30,"The valiant Sugreeva who is by now the king of monkeys army, then apprised the great-souled Rama about his grand anointment, and thus he not only regained his wife Ruma but also secured the kingdom, like the chief of divinities Indra. [4-26-42]"
4-27-1,"The readers familiar with critical edition may find only twenty-three verses in thatedition, whereas this traditional version contains forty-eight of them. Twenty-five verses thataccount the names of trees, river-flows, beauty of nature etc., extolling nature are here as aningredient of epical literature that aim to remind us about the need for a good environment, ratherthan to worry about global warming, ozone depletion, deforestation etc."
4-27-2,"Rama along with his brother Lakshmana reached Mt. Prasavana while the enthronedSugreeva entered the cave-city Kishkindha. [4-27-1]"
4-27-3,"Mt. Prasavana is pervaded with noisily growling tigers and beasts, mightily roaringlions, compacted with diverse shrubs and creeper-plants, overspread with many a kind of tree, thusit is adored by bears, monkeys, baboons, and even by wildcats, and that mountain which is alwayssanctifying and tranquil is like a heap of clouds in its shine. [4-27-2, 3]"
4-27-4,"Rama along with Lakshmana has taken up an ample spaced cave as residence on thecliff of that mountain. [4-27-4]"
4-27-5,"Rama, the faultless one and the elder brother of Lakshmana, who is the delight ofRaghu's dynasty, and who made an accord with Sugreeva regarding cessation of activity during rainyseason, spoke these significant and timely words to his humble brother Lakshmana who is theenhancer of prosperity. [4-27-5, 6a]"
4-27-6,"This delightful mountain cave is spacious and breezy, hence, oh, enemy destroyerSoumitri, let us stay in this during rainy nights. [4-27-6]"
4-27-7,"This admirable peak of mountain is embellished with white, black and coppery rockfaces, oh, prince, thus this is fully overspread with diverse ores. Bristling with rivers andfrogs, and brimmed with clumps of various trees along with beautiful and amazing creeper-plants itis elaborated. It is highly reverberated with diverse birds and filled with the screeches of bestpeacocks. And bloomed Maalati and Jasmine bushes, also trees like Sindhuvara, Shirrishika, furtherthe trees like Kadamba, Arjuna, and Sarja in bloom, are brightening it and it is delightful.[4-27-7b, 8, 9, 10]"
4-27-8,"This pleasant lake of lotuses enwreathed with its blossomy lotuses, oh, prince, isavailable not far away from our cave. [4-27-11]"
4-27-9,"This cave with its north-easterly slope will be homely for us since the inrush ofrainwater will be less, oh, gentle one, also thus with its upraised westerly portion this cave willbe less of gusts that come from east. [4-27-12]"
4-27-10,"The black stone available at the doorway of the cave that looks like a spatteredmound of mascara is broad, even-surfaced, and will be pleasant for a repose. [4-27-13]"
4-27-11,"See this mountain peak that looks like a scattered mound of mascara, dear boy,which rose up like a black-cloud on the sky, and it is an auspicious one for it is in northernside. [4-27-14]"
4-27-12,"Even see this mountain available in the southerly direction as if a white cloth isspread on sky, which is vying with Mt. Kailash and abounding with many an ore. [4-27-15]"
4-27-13,"Also see this river unusually sludge-less, flowing from the wide of the cave andstreaming eastward, spruced up with trees like Sandalwood, Tilaka, Saala, Tamaala, Atimukta,Padmaka, Sarala, and even with Ashoka trees, and it looks as if River Ganga is flowing in Trikuta.[4-27-16, 17]"
4-27-14,"With the trees born on the riverbank and available here and there in variousshapes, like Vaaniira, Timida, Vakula, Ketaka, and with Hintaala, Tinisha, Niipa, Vetasa,Kritamaala trees, that river is brightened up, and thus that river appears as a dame finelybedecked with raiment and ornaments. [4-27-18, 19]"
4-27-15,"This river is fairly resonated with the calls of diverse birds in hundreds offlights, beautified with ruddy gees that are doting one upon the other, and admired by the swansand cranes upon her highly appealing sand-isles, thus she appears to be a damsel decorated withjewels with a toothy grin.

4-27-21,"The melodies of singing and the tunes of musical instruments played and sung inKishkindha are heard from here, oh, the best-triumphant Lakshmana, and even the blares of vanara-stogether with their snobbish drumming is heard, hence it is not far away. [4-27-27]"
4-27-22,"It is definite that the best monkey Sugreeva must be surrounded by his friends,thus he must be exuberant, as he won an utmost prosperity in winning back his wife and winning thekingdom. Rama thus spoke to Lakshmana. [4-27-28]"
4-27-23,"Raghava having said thus resided on that Mt. Prasavana along with Lakshmana, whereatmany sightly caves and arbours are there. [4-27-29]"

4-27-31,"If you are much too lackadaisical, indeed, you will not be capable to eliminate theenemy in war, specially a demon, especially a trickster, let alone all of your daring enterprises.[4-27-36]"

4-27-40,"A valiant one who is succoured will be indebted with some requital on his part, butbesides being unfaithful, if one who does not make requital for all the favours done in hisinterest, he will be wounding the hearts of soft-hearted people.

4-27-41,"Visualising what Rama said about their waiting for pre-winter season to be candid,and praisefully making palm-fold at that determination of Rama, and even to clarify his ownopportune viewpoint, Lakshmana spoke to Rama who by his own aspect is a delightful one for a ken.[4-27-46]"
4-27-42,"Oh, lord of people, Sugreeva will be effectuating everything you have desired andsaid, not later but soon, hence awaiting autumn you may please bear up these heavy rainfalls,besides bearing with the idea of disciplining the enemy. [4-27-47]"
4-27-43,"Let autumn be awaited while containing your anger, and along with me you may stayon this mountain which is adored by lions, and spend these four rainy months here like a monsoonlion, although you are capable to eliminate the enemy at any moment like a lion. [4-27-48]"

4-28-33,"Somewhere the interiors of forests are finely singing, in affect, as they have swarms of singing honeybees; elsewhere, they are richly dancing, practically, as the purple-necked peacocks are bestirring; somewhere else, they are highly excited, virtually, as lordly elephants are highly excited, thus the interiors of forests are beaming forth as retreats to many bees, birds and animals. [3-28-33]"
4-28-34,"Plentiful in Kadamba, Sarja, Arjuna, Kandala trees and with the heaps of their reddish flowers fallen on ground, and well-excited peacocks screaming and dancing like the tipplers of that liquor like nectar, thus the interiors of forest are aplenty with nectar of those fallen flowers flowing like water, thus they are impressively similar to the lands of liquor, say watering-holes.

4-28-40,"When the swarthy clouds full with new waters are docking among swarthily clouds, they are shining forth like mountains burnt by wildfire docking among other mountains that are already burnt by wildfire, both moored at mountain-bases. [3-28-40]"

[3-28-46]"
4-28-47,"Sky is closely enshrouded with clouds, neither sun nor stars are getting around for a glimpse, earth is fully satiated with the torrents of new water, enswathed in obscurity the precincts are unilluminated... [3-28-47]"

4-28-60,"Though Sugreeva is very humble to embark on a campaign, visualising the rainy season as an impossible one for any campaign, and even the pathways are rendered highly impassable I have not said anything to him in the affirmative. [3-28-60]"
4-28-61,"Even Sugreeva has undergone many difficulties in their entirety, after a long while he is united with his wife, and even owing to the magnitude involved in our task of tracking down Ravana I did not desire to insist on that monkey. [3-28-61]"
4-28-62,"After a respite Sugreeva will realise on his own that the time has come, and he will also realise the he has something to requite, isn&#39;t it! So, there needn&#39;t be any doubt in that matter. [3-28-62]"

4-28-64,"A valiant one who is succoured will be indebted with some requital on his part, but besides being unfaithful, if one who does not make requital for all the favours done in his interest, he will be wounding the hearts of soft-hearted people.

4-28-65,"Visualising what Rama said about their waiting for pre-winter season to be candid, and praisefully making palm-fold at that determination of Rama, and even to clarify his own opportune viewpoint, Lakshmana spoke to Rama who by his own aspect is a delightful one for a ken. [3-28-65]"
4-28-66,"Oh, lord of people, Sugreeva will be effectuating everything you have desired and said, not later but soon, hence awaiting autumn you may please bear up these heavy rainfalls, besides bearing with the idea of disciplining the enemy. So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-28-66]"
4-29-1,"On observing clear sky on which back-clouds and electric charges have disappeared, on which Saarasa birds are vibrantly bustling and delightful moonshine is coated, and even on observing him whose riches are abundant, who has slowed down in accumulating probity and prosperity from the viewpoint of rectitude, highly engrossed in the course of unvirtuous profligates, whose heart is given to undisturbed privacy, and the one who on achieving his goals and dearest longings has turned away from other pursuits, who regained his choicest wife, and gained highly covetable Lady Tara, thus, who is always indulged in females, merrymaking day in and day out on a par with Indra, which Indra will be sporting with the cohorts of gandharva and apsara females, thereby he who is making much of his fortune on getting rid of other problems, besides, he who reposed the activity of kingdom in his ministers, yet, who does not make eyes at those ministers as he is doubtless of the kingdom which was once disrupted from his control, because, that kingdom is looked after well by the very same ministers, as such he is wallowing in promiscuity, such as he is, seeking the presence of such a Sugreeva, king of monkeys and an explicator, and even on winning his grace, he who is forthright regarding norms of ethics, an exceptional knower of subtleties of transactions and the rubrics of duty and time, that golden-tongued Hanuma, the son of Air-god, spoke sweet words that are reasonable, heart-pleasing, beneficial, pragmatic, profitable, impressive, immaculate, imperative, and impartial, and which words are also inclusive of care and concern of Hanuma, on making a determination with a belief that Sugreeva will pay heed to his words.

4-29-2,"Acquired is the kingdom and glory as well, thus enriched is your dynastic prosperity, but foregathering friends is still remaining, and it will be apt of you to negotiate it. [4-29-9b, 10a]"
4-29-3,"Indeed, he who really conducts himself punctually and amicably with friends, his kingdom, glory and valour will flourish. [4-29-10b, 11a]"
4-29-4,"Matchless kingdom is his who can keep his treasury, army, friends and his own sovereignty - all these four, in equiponderance. [4-29-11b, c]"
4-29-5,"Therefore, as the one with straightforward actions firstly you resort to an unimperilled course of action, lest any peril is imminent, and it will be apt of you to dutifully achieve the purpose of your friend Rama, for which alone Rama along with Lakshmana came to you, thus let your power preponderate. [4-29-12]"
4-29-6,"Adversity thwarts him who comports himself with overenthusiasm only in self-indulgences, and who does not expeditiously strive for the sake of his friend leaving off all other activities of self-indulgence. [4-29-13]"
4-29-7,"One who belatedly functions for the present mission of his friend, he will indeed be unassociated with that mission, despite of the fact that he has once performed great deeds in respect of the same friend. [4-29-14]"
4-29-8,"Hence, the task of our friend is delayed, oh, enemy-destroyer, searching for Vaidehi is Raghava&#39;s mission and let it be done. [4-29-15]"
4-29-9,"Though the time is lagging, oh, king, that insightful and punctual Rama is not indicating about it to you, though he is hurrying to complete his mission within a time-frame, because he is following you alone abiding under the control abiding by your promise. [4-29-16]"
4-29-10,"Raghava is the cause for augmentation of multitudes, a long-lasting covenentor, and even an undefinable one in his proficiency, and an unparalleled one by his grace. [4-29-17]"
4-29-11,"Certainly you have to carry through his mission as he has carried out your mission previously, and oh, lord of monkeys, it will be apt of you to summon worthy monkeys for searching Seetha. [4-29-18]"
4-29-12,"As long as Rama is not going to prod us for action deem that there is no time lapse, but the minute he does deem it as lapsed. [4-29-19]"
4-29-13,"You are a helpful one even to those that are unhelpful to you, oh, king of monkeys, then why repeat about him who helped you in getting your kingdom, and even in killing your enemy, Vali."
4-29-14,"Even if Rama did not help you in getting your kingdom and killing Vali you have to render your help to Rama, for you are a beacon of friendship and you are a helpful one without seeking any requital... then why you are delaying...[4-29-20]"
4-29-15,"Highly adventurous and powerful vanara as you are, oh, lord of multitudes of monkeys and bears, why do you really temporise in issuing orders to fulfil the cherish of Rama. [4-29-21]"
4-29-16,"If need be Rama of Dasharatha is really capable of keeping gods, demons and great-vipers under his control with his arrows, but he is anticipating fulfilment of your promise. [4-29-22]"
4-29-17,"He fulfilled an exceptional cherish of yours without much doubting for the forfeiture of his own life, hence we search for his wife Vaidehi anywhere on earth or even on skies. [4-29-23]"
4-29-18,"Gods cannot cause dismay to him, then gandharva-s - no; multitudes of wind-gods - no; asura-s - no; yaksha-s - no; and then wherefore the raakshasa-s can? [4-29-24]"
4-29-19,"Therefore, oh, lord of monkeys, that Rama is energetic to exert himself, but he fulfilled your aspiration earlier, and it will be apt of you requite him with his aspiration at all events. [4-29-25]"
4-29-20,"In case you were ordering us, oh, king of monkeys, among us whosoever he may be his impetus will be unhampered either in netherworlds, or in water, or up above on the sky. [4-29-26]"
4-29-21,"Therefore command us, oh, merited one, as you have more than ten million unchallengeable monkeys under your command, as to who should start from where and for which purpose, and as to how one should exert himself. Thus Hanuma appealed to Sugreeva. [4-29-27]"
4-29-22,"On hearing the words of Hanuma that are validly demonstrated on time, Sugreeva whose soldiery is substantial, took a noble decision. [4-29-28]"
4-29-23,"And the noble minded Sugreeva directed Nila, one of the commanders of vanara army, and who always strives to foregather vanara army, to foregather all of the monkey-forces available in all the directions. [4-29-29]"

4-31-29,"With his eyes reddened in rancour that highly adorable Lakshmana sent a word throughAngada, saying ""oh, boy, let Sugreeva be informed about my arrival,"" and said this way.[4-31-32]"
4-31-30,"Oh, enemy-destroyer Angada, oh, boy, you may say these words to Sugreeva, 'oh,enemy-destroyer Sugreeva, distressed by the distress of his brother this Lakshmana has arrived inyour presence and waiting at the door, oh, Sugreeva, the vanara, if you are interested it will beapt of you to listen to his advise, either by coming here or inviting him inside...' saying so oh,boy Angada, you comeback quickly. Thus Lakshmana spoke to Angada. [4-31-33, 34]"
4-31-31,"On hearing the words of Lakshmana Angada is muffled up in grief, and on arriving inthe presence of his father Sugreeva he informed ""Soumitri has come."" [4-31-35]"
4-31-32,"Bewildered in his perception at the very sharp words of Lakshmana, mighty Angadathen has gone to the palace assuming a very sad face, and there he firstly saluted the feet of hisfather Sugreeva and then at the feet of Ruma, wife of Sugreeva. [4-31-36]"
4-31-33,"Angada whose vitality is intense clinched himself to the feet of his fatherSugreeva, and later clung to the feet of his mother Tara, and he even clasped the feet of hispaternal-aunt Ruma, and latching on to the feet of his parents then he stated to appeal to themabout the message of Lakshmana. [4-31-37]"
4-31-34,"Sugreeva, the vanara, who is bound up in drowsiness and dizziness could notcomprehend clearly what Angada is talking about, as he is benumbed with intoxication, and evennumbed down with the torpor of lustfulness. [4-31-38]"
4-31-35,"The hearts of mobbing monkeys are flustered with fear when they pored overinfuriated Lakshmana, thus they jibber-jabbered so as to appease him. [4-31-39]"
4-31-36,"And those monkeys on observing Lakshmana instantly raised a hubbub at his nearbythat is similar to a storm of a torrent, thunder of a thunderbolt, and the roar of a lion.[4-31-40]"
4-31-37,"With that uproarious noise of monkeys Sugreeva came to his senses, but because ofstupor his coppery eyes are helter-skelter and his garlands and ornaments are topsy-turvy.[4-31-41]"
4-31-38,"On hearing the words of Angada two ministers who are agreeable in their advice andappreciable in their aspect have come along with him, and those two ministers of the king ofvanara-s, namely Plaksha and Prabhava, have appraised Sugreeva that Lakshmana has arrived todiscuss variously about the prosperity and probity. [4-31-42, 43]"
4-31-39,"Those two ministers sitting around and nearby Sugreeva, who is seated like the kingof wind-gods, namely Indra, on appeasing him with meaningful and expressive words they spoke to himin this way. [4-31-44]"
4-31-40,"Rama and Lakshmana are the brothers who abide by truth, highly-providential, andthough they are worthy enough to rule kingdom for themselves they have bestowed the kingdom to you,such as they are, they have become your true friends. Thus started the ministers to say toSugreeva. [4-31-45]"
4-31-41,"One among those two, Lakshmana, is biding at the door wielding his bow, by whom themonkeys are panicked and venting out alarms shuddering utterly. [4-31-46]"
4-31-42,"This Lakshmana, the brother of Raghava, has arrived here at the decree of Rama onthe chariot called his 'endeavour', charioted by the charioteer called 'the word of Rama.'[4-31-47]"
4-31-43,"Oh, merited one, even Lakshmana has ushered this Angada hastily, oh, king, theprecious son of Tara, to your presence. [4-31-48]"
4-31-44,"Oh, king of monkeys, such as he is, that brave Lakshmana is sticking fast at thedoor with an awning of rancour on his eyes and as if to burn down the monkeys just with his eyes.[4-31-49]"
4-31-45,"You may approach him quickly along with your son and relatives, oh, great-king,prostrate yourself before him holding him in reverence, and thus let his bitterness be indeedpacified now. [4-31-50]"
4-31-46,"Whatever that virtue-souled Rama says that you have to implement wholeheartedly,oh, king, you abide by the forthrightness of your promise, stick up for the pact you made. Thusthe ministers advised Sugreeva. [4-31-51]"
4-32-1,"On hearing the words of Angada along with those of his ministers, namely Hanuma, Plaksha, and Prabhava et al, also on knowing that Lakshmana is angered, that sensible Sugreeva stirred from seat. [4-32-1]"
4-32-2,"On discriminating the pros and cons Sugreeva spoke this sentence to the strategist-ministers, for he himself is an expert in strategies and a diligent one in carrying out those strategies. [4-32-2]"
4-32-3,"I have not in the least spoken any ill of them, nor committed any misdeed in their respect, thus I am thinking why should Raghava&#39;s brother Lakshmana take offence at me? [4-32-3]"
4-32-4,"Unsympathetic rivals of mine, who will always be snoopy for scope, might have ear-filled Raghava&#39;s brother about the fabricated faults of mine. [4-32-4]"
4-32-5,"In this situation, all of you on your part and according to your perspectives have to find out firstly and meticulously about the attitude of Lakshmana, along with a steady but diligent determination thereof. [4-32-5]"
4-32-6,"Definitely there is no fear for me from Lakshmana, not even from Raghava, but an unfounded ire of a friend alone is giving rise to disquiet. [4-32-6]"
4-32-7,"It is always practicable to befriend any, but in turn it is impracticable to manage that friendship, even a trifle splits off that friendliness for sentiments are transient. [4-32-7]"
4-32-8,"On that score I am flustering because of the noble-souled Rama, and I cannot possibly requite the favour that has been done to me. So said Sugreeva to his ministers. [4-32-8]"
4-32-9,"While Sugreeva is saying that way, the eminent-monkey Hanuma spoke with a dint of his own expediency, from among the Vanara ministers. [4-32-9]"
4-32-10,"In any case, it is not astonishing to say, oh, king of monkey troops, that you with a deep regard have not forgotten the advantageous help rendered to you, since it is natural for you. [4-32-10]"
4-32-11,"On his part Raghava tossed off his fear distantly and eliminated Vali, whose valour equals that of Indra, only to fulfil your cherish. [4-32-11]"
4-32-12,"Anywise, by virtue of his friendliness with you Raghava must be annoyed, hence he must have expedited his brother Lakshmana, whose disposition in effect to is enhance prosperity. [4-32-12]"
4-32-13,"You have become ecstatic, oh, the best of the best timekeepers, hence you are unaware of the slippage of time, but the sedate and dark-green autumn on its part is underway unfolding dark-green leaves canopying seven-leaved banana plants. [4-32-13]"
4-32-14,"Clear is the sky with its planets and stars as clouds have vanished on it, even all the ten directions are clear, and the rivers and lakes too are equable. [4-32-14]"
4-32-15,"Because the time for campaigns has chanced, oh, the ablest monkey, and because you were very slumberous you have not got the drift of it, as such Lakshmana must have come here, and it is obvious. [4-32-15]"
4-32-16,"Raghava&#39;s bitter words are endurable by you as he is primarily an anguished person, further he is the one whose is wife is abducted, and furthermore he is magnanimous in giving kingdom to you, besides, he is reproachful through another person, namely Lakshmana. [4-32-16]"
4-32-17,"Indeed, I do not foresee any other appropriate means for you, as a blunder is committed by you, other than seeking Lakshmana&#39;s pardon duly adjoining your palms. [4-32-17]"
4-32-18,"A king is to be advised beneficially and unhesitatingly by the minister designates, that is why I am speaking what I hold fast discarding fear. [4-32-18]"
4-32-19,"If Raghava is highly infuriated he is capable to keep the world under his control along with gods, demons, gandharva-s just on hitching up his bow, isn&#39;t it! [4-32-19]"
4-32-20,"It becomes unseemly to infuriate him who is to be placated time and again, especially when remembering his earlier beneficence to you and when you are beholden to him. [4-32-20]"
4-32-21,"Prostrate yourself before him along with your son, friends and relatives to pay deference, oh, king, and abide by your own accord you made with him remaining under his auspices, like a wife abiding in the care of her husband. [4-32-21]"
4-32-22,"It will be unseemly to fend off the ruling of Rama, or of his brother Lakshmana even in your imagination, oh, king of monkeys, as your heart is aware of the humanly tenacity of that Rama, whose resplendence vies with that of Indra, and who is associated with selfsame Lakshmana, isn&#39;t it. Thus Hanuma spoke to Sugreeva. [4-32-22]"
4-33-1,"This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Aranya Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. Here Sugreeva is indulged in bodily pleasures with his own females and in Aranya Kanda, as accused by Shurpanakha, Ravana is hankering after other&#39;s women. Here Sugreeva dizzy with drinks and in Aranya Ravana is dizzy with his supremacy. These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with <em>raaja niiti shastra</em> &#39;political science.&#39; Here the only rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shurpanakha. Out of total 66 verses that are here in this traditional edition, verses from 25 to 62 are unavailable in critical edition, perhaps estimating them to be lateral interpolations, and there this chapter is quickly concluded. These verses belong to the exposition of &#39;kingly vices...&#39; on which Tara rationally defends."
4-33-2,"Then on invitation to inside, Lakshmana, the slayer of braving enemies, entered that delightful cavelike Kishkindha at Rama&#39;s orders. [4-33-1]"
4-33-3,"On seeing Lakshmana the huge bodied and highly mighty monkeys available at the gateway stood back with their palms adjoined in supplication. [4-33-2]"
4-33-4,"But on seeing at the fumingly infuriated son of Dasharatha, all the monkeys have become scared and they did not even gather around him. [4-33-3]"
4-33-5,"Glorious Lakshmana has seen the splendid Kishkindha which is a colossal cave crafted with jewels, replete with flowered orchards and richly rife with gemlike-objects d&#39;art. [4-33-4]"
4-33-6,"Kishkindha is compacted with mansions and multi-storied buildings that are embellished with various precious stones, and it is enlivened with blossomed trees that bear fruit of every relish and of every season, and Lakshmana has seen such a Kishkindha. [4-33-5]"
4-33-7,"That city is brightened with vanara-s who with their prepossessing appearances are attired in marvellous garlands and garments, and who can change their guise just by their wish, as they are the children of gods and gandharva-s, and Lakshmana has seen such a city. [4-33-6]"
4-33-8,"She is perfumed with the fragrances that are pleasing the sense of smell like sandal-scent, true-aloe-scent, and the scents of lotuses, and her wide avenues are highly exhilarated with the bouquet of flower-liquors and grape-wines, and Lakshmana has seen such a sweet-scanted city Kishkindha. [4-33-7]"
4-33-9,"In that city Lakshmana of Raghava dynasty has seen buildings that are not single-storied but multi-storied, semblable with Mt. Vindhya and Mt. Meru, and he even saw mountain-rapids with pure water. [4-33-8]"
4-33-10,"On the kings-way Lakshmana has seen the exquisite mansion of Angada, likewise the lavish mansions of distinction pertaining to the other vanara chiefs, namely Dvivida, Gavaya, Gavaaksha, Gaja, and Sharabha, Vidyunmaali, Sampaati, Suuryaaksha, Hanuma, and that of the noble-souled Nala, and even those of Virabaahu, Subaahu, Kumuda, Sushena, Lt. Taara, Jambavanta, Dadhivaktra, Niila, Supaatala, and that of Sunetra. [4-33-9, 10, 11, 12]"
4-33-11,"Those mansions that glitter like silver-clouds, fragrant with scents and festooned with flower-tassels, replete with wealth and food grains, are beaming with gemlike female-vanara-s, and Lakshmana saw them on his way. [4-33-13]"
4-33-12,"The grand palace of the king of monkeys, Sugreeva, which vies with the palace of Indra is inaccessibly immured in a whitely mountain. The spires of that palace are similar to the peaks of Mt. Kailash and it is shining forth with fully blossomed trees yielding fruits that can fulfil every relish of everyone. Some more providential and heart-pleasing trees available there are the endowment of Indra, which in shine are equal to blackish rainy-clouds, yielding divine flowers and fruits, and casting cool shades. Excellent garlands are strung round the palace and robust monkeys wielding weapons are screening its gateways, while its main archway cast in refined golden is splendorous. And the very bold Lakshmana unimpededly entered such a fascinating palace of Sugreeva, as with the sun entering a colossal cloud. [4-33-14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
4-33-13,"Passing through a set of seven courtyards in which carriers like palanquins, sedans, and even settees are spread over, that duty-bound Lakshmana has seen the highly protected and prodigious palace-chambers of Sugreeva, which is stuffed here and there with numerous golden and silver love-beds and divans on which highly valuable upholstery is provided. [4-33-19, 20]"
4-33-14,"On his very entry Lakshmana heard the ongoing melodious tunes commixed with lyrics and strains of string-instruments, and all are unvarying in cadence, wording and lettering."
4-33-15,"On his very entry Lakshmana heard the ongoing melodious tunes of lyrics with pulsing wording and lettering, conjoined with strains from string-instruments, like Veena etc., and all have a pulsating cadency. [4-33-21]"
4-33-16,"And the great-mighty Lakshmana has seen many females in Sugreeva&#39;s palace with diverse features and prideful of their beauty and youth. [4-33-22]"
4-33-17,"On observing the females of a worthy bloodline in the palace of Sugreeva, who are wearing garlands of worthily flowers, engrossed in making worthwhile flower-tassels and even adorned with worthiest jewellery, he also made a mark of the chambermaids. None of them is overawed, overstrained, and everyone is over-embellished in dressiness. [4-33-23, 24]"
4-33-18,"Thereafter on hearing the chimes of silver-anklets and tintinnabulations of golden cinctures of female vanara-s that refulgent Saumitri is embarrassed to proceed further. [4-33-25]"
4-33-19,"On hearing the tinkles of the jewellery of female vanara-s valiant Lakshmana is highly provoked with an instantaneous bitterness, and he twitched bowstring as though to fill all the points of compass with twanging. [4-33-26]"
4-33-20,"His decent conduct hauling him down dextrous Lakshmana stood aside contingent on isolation, and alongside his heartfelt anguish of Rama. [4-33-27]"
4-33-21,"With that twang of the bowstring the king of fly-jumpers Sugreeva is startled and jerked up from his exquisite seat as he ensured that Lakshmana has arrived. [4-33-28]"
4-33-22,"As Angada indicated to me earlier, Saumitri, the votary of his brother, has come down on... it is very clear... Thus Sugreeva exclaimed. [4-33-29]"
4-33-23,"As has been apprised by Angada earlier, and even now by the twang of bowstring, that vanara Sugreeva made up his mind about Lakshmana&#39;s arrival, and he has become whey-faced. [4-33-30]"
4-33-24,"The chief of monkeys Sugreeva then staidly spoke this advantageous word to the exquisite lady Tara while his heart is bewildered with dismay. [4-33-31]"
4-33-25,"This brother of Raghava is mellow-hearted by his nature, oh, suavely eye-browed Tara, but he turned up as if with some disdain, really what must be the reason for a grudge! [4-33-32]"
4-33-26,"What do you see as the basis of this young man&#39;s spite, oh impeccable Tara, this best one among men will not invoke despite, indeed, to a fault. [4-33-33]"
4-33-27,"If you consider that we have done something objectionable to him, in the least, let that be quickly determined by your nimble-wittedness and let that be made known immediately. [4-33-34]"
4-33-28,"Otherwise, oh, lady, you alone are apt to see him in person, and it will be apt of you to appease him with words blent with mitigation. [4-33-35]"
4-33-29,"Just on seeing you he that highly pure-souled Lakshmana will stop venting his spleen, by the way, great-souls will not be rampageous with women, isn&#39;t it! [4-33-36]"
4-33-30,"If you seek his presence with propitiatory words his heart and senses will be pacified, and then I will be able to see that lotus-petal-eyed Lakshmana, the destroyer of his enemies. Sugreeva thus spoke to Tara. [4-33-37]"
4-33-31,"Exquisitely featured Tara went to the proximity of Lakshmana with a waddling gait, tipsily flustering eyes, rrivi&egrave;re-strings of golden cincture dangling, and with a sticklike gracile body humbly bent. [4-33-38]"
4-33-32,"On observing the wife of the king of monkeys, the great-souled son of the king of humans stood aside unemotionally, and because of the presence of females he backed down on his anger with his face cast down. [4-33-39]"
4-33-33,"She who is unblushing by virtue of her inebriety ad even by the gracious look of the prince Lakshmana, such a Tara spoke a highly noteworthy sentence that is dauntless in friendliness and entirely mitigatory in its vein. [4-33-40]"
4-33-34,"Oh, prince, what is the cause of your anger? Who is not abiding by your oral order? And who is he that draweth nigh of a wildfire that is befalling on a forest of dried-up trees, without a shadow of doubt? Tara enquired thus with Lakshmana. [4-33-41]"
4-33-35,"On hearing her words which are with a prelude of propitiation, and which by far evince friendship for all practical purposes, Lakshmana trustfully spoke these words. [4-33-42]"
4-33-36,"Oh, Tara, the associate of husband&#39;s prosperity! Why your husband is bound up in profligacy alone, remiss in garnering rectitude and riches, and his dereliction is unbeknownst to you, is it! [4-33-43]"
4-33-37,"Without thinking either about the interests of the kingdom or about us that are cringing to anguish, oh, Tara, your husband along with his council of ministers is indulged in lechery. [4-33-44]"
4-33-38,"On stipulating a four month criterion for an embargo the king of fly-jumpers is not able to realise the completion of that period as he is frantically insensible. [4-33-45]"
4-33-39,"For the purpose of achieving rightly rectitude and rightful riches this way of bacchanalia is inappreciable, isn&#39;t it! Just going on drinking will bring prosperity, aspirations and even probity to ruin. [4-33-46]"
4-33-40,"If one is not going to requite the favour done in his respect an awful detriment occurs in his own rectitude, isn&#39;t it. Thereby, that reneger will loose a highly noble friend and thereby a great shortcoming occurs to him in achieving his purposes. Thus a threefold ill befalls on that reneger. [4-33-47]"
4-33-41,"Indeed a friend avowed to truthfulness and virtuousness is greater than one&#39;s own means and aspirations, but you husband forsaking that pair of his means and aspirations that have been fulfilled by such a righteous friend, he is not even standing by the probity. [4-33-48]"
4-33-42,"Therefore, when our present task is standstill in this way due to the bouts of your husband, oh, the knower of the brunt of tasks, what is it we can undertake hereafter...you yourself may aptly give an example... Thus, Lakshmana spoke curtly to Tara. [4-33-49]"
4-33-43,"On hearing his words containing means, merit and reconciliation, and of mellowly tendency of Lakshmana, Tara realized that the purpose of Rama is lapsed, but having confidence in ultimate success she again said to him."
4-33-44,"On hearing his words containing means, merit and reconciliation, and of mellowly tendency of Lakshmana, and even on realizing the lapse committed by Sugreeva in the purpose of Rama, yet reposing her confidence in Sugreeva&#39;s capability to achieve results, she again said to Lakshmana. [4-33-50]"
4-33-45,"Oh, prince, this not the time for angering, also your own people shall not be subjected to anger, and it will be apt of you to tolerate Sugreeva&#39;s fault because he is desirous of achieving results for you. [4-33-51]"
4-33-46,"How in name can a meritoriously high-minded being will show his anger on a relatively mightless inferior being, say Sugreeva, whose mightiest brother&#39;s mightiness and essence, say that of Vali, are deducted by none other but by your brother associated with you, and oh, lad, who goes into the control of fury, say of your kind, while he is restrained by his perfection, and a source of abstemiousness. [4-33-52]"
4-33-47,"I am aware of the fury of Rama, the friend of champion of the monkeys, namely Sugreeva, I am also aware of the time lapse in the task, I am even aware of the folly we have committed, and what need be done in this matter, I am well aware. [4-33-53]"
4-33-48,"As to how the intensity of bodily pleasure-seeking will be highly intolerable, I am aware even of that, and I am equally aware of those female vanara-s with whom Sugreeva is now incessantly bound up with lust. [4-33-54]"
4-33-49,"Gauging by your mindset which is presently bridled by fury, you appear to be disinclined towards spells of sensualities, thus these aspects are past your comprehension. All right! If a man were to be voluptuary he will be inadvertent of place and time, isn&#39;t it! Then, how about ethicalities, or rights and wrongs? [4-33-55]"
4-33-50,"He who shunned decency because of the vehemence of randiness, oh, the eradicator of braving enemies, and he who is delighting in lust is consorted with me, ergo condone your brother-like Sugreeva, the protector of Vaanara dynasty. [4-33-56]"
4-33-51,"Esteemed sages who take delight in their holy merit and pious asceticism, they themselves will be closely following the course of their desire fulfilment when entangled in lust, then how about this one, namely Sugreeva, being an impulsive monkey, besides being a king, how he cannot wallow in enjoyments. [4-33-57]"
4-33-52,"She that vanara female Tara whose eyes are fluttery under the influence having said this way, she again picked up where she left off and sentimentally spoke this sentence to Lakshmana whose brunt is inestimable, in the interest of her husband&#39;s wellbeing. [4-33-58]"
4-33-53,"On the part of his endeavour in your task, oh, best one among men, he has ordered long before for its operation aiming to achieve your objective, despite of the fact that he is servile to overindulgence. [4-33-59]"
4-33-54,"By all means, marvellously intrepid Vanara-s that are the residents of various mountains and that can change gusie just by their wish have come in hundreds, in thousands, in millions. [4-33-60]"
4-33-55,"Hence oh, dextrous one, get inside the palace-chambers for you have been standing here at the door coyly unwilling to behold womenfolk inside, and enough is this upholding of tradition by you. Oh, come on, peering at the wives of friends with a friendly intent is not at all impolite for good-willers. Thus Tara affectionately invited Lakshmana inside the palace-chambers. [4-33-61]"
4-33-56,"Welcomed by Tara and hastened by haste of his duty, that dextrous enemy-destroyer Lakshmana entered the select-chambers. [4-33-62]"
4-33-57,"Lakshmana has then seen him who is seated like the Sun in firmament on a choicest golden seat which is elaborated with worthiest upholstery, whose body is remarkable besides being spruced up with excellent ornaments, who is wearing exquisite garlands and robes, who is glorious with a marvellous appearance and even appeared as an unconquerable as with Indra, and who is presently enwreathed with vanara-females who are also bedecked with precious ornamentation and garlands, and on seeing him Lakshmana with franticly bloodshot eyes appeared as the Terminator. [4-33-63, 64, 65]"
4-33-58,"Sugreeva whose complexion is like that of rich gold is seated on an exquisite seat tightly hugging his wife Ruma, and that brave one has seen Lakshmana whose quintessence is never-flinching, thus, that suspiciously wide-eyed Sugreeva made sheep eyes at the furiously broad-eyed Lakshmana. [4-33-66]"
4-34-1,"On seeing the illustrious Lakshmana who entered unimpededly and infuriately,Sugreeva became one with agitated senses. [4-34-1]"
4-34-2,"On seeing Lakshmana, the son of Dasharatha, who is exasperated and exhaling heavily,and who searing in the anguish of his brother is flaring up like a firestorm, Sugreeva hopped upfrom his golden seat and tottered like the highly decorated flagstaff of Indra, which will bewobbly before it is thrown to ground after the ritual. [4-34-2, 3]"
4-34-3,"While Sugreeva is jumping up stumblingly, stumbled with him are Ruma and the otherfemales in tow, who are so far clinging to him, like the clusters of stars that spring up on theemergence of full moon in sky. [4-34-4]"
4-34-4,"That fortunate Sugreeva whose eyes are bloodshot with drinking flurried towardsLakshmana adjoining palms in supplication, and became standstill at his nearby, like a lofty<font color=""#B3003A"">kalpa vriksha</font> wish-fulfilling tree. [4-34-5]"
4-34-5,"Infuriate Lakshmana spoke to Sugreeva who like the star clustered moon is standingwith his wife Ruma at his side amid other vanara females. [4-34-6]"
4-34-6,"One who is dynamic, abounding with best troopers, sympathetic, senses conquered, afaithful one and an advocate of truth, he alone thrives as a king in the world. [4-34-7]"
4-34-7,"He who is enthroned as a king but anchored himself to dishonesty and makes fakeassurances to helpful friends, who can be more ruthless than him? [4-34-8]"
4-34-8,"A person gets attached to the sin of killing of a hundred of his manes, deifiedsouls of his own ancestors, if he promises to gift one horse but fails to do so, and in promisingto gift one cow but failing in it he gets the sin of killing a thousand manes, and if he promisesto a person to do the needful help and fails in rendering that help, then he gets the sin ofsuicide along with the sin of killing his own kith and kin. [4-34-9]"
4-34-9,"He who gets his means fulfilled earlier through his friends but does not requitethem, oh, king of monkeys, such a treacherous one is eliminable for all beings. [4-34-10]"
4-34-10,"On seeing such perfidious soul, oh, fly-jumper, Brahma irefully declared this versewhich is reverenced by all the worlds, you too may know it. [4-34-11]"
4-34-11," 'The savants have ordained atonement for slayers of cows, for drinkers of liquors,thus for thieves and infringers of solemnity, but no atonement is available to a treacherousperson. [4-34-12]"
4-34-12,"Oh, Vanara, firstly you have got your purpose fulfilled and by that reason you arenot reciprocating help to Rama, thereby you are an uncultured and unfriendly one, and illusive isyour word of honour. [4-34-13]"
4-34-13,"Oh, Vanara, you achieved your means through Rama, and Rama is wishing for hisendeavour through you, and I wonder whether the search for Seetha is not your duty? [4-34-14]"
4-34-14,"An illusive promisor basking in churlish pleasures, such as you are, Rama has notrealised that you are a serpent with the croaking of a frog. [4-34-15]"
4-34-15,"By the highly prudent and compassionate Rama, you the sinner got the kingdom ofmonkeys, and it is a gain of an evil-soul from a noble-soul. [4-34-16]"
4-34-16,"If you do not recognise what the noble-souled Raghava has done to you, you will beinstantly killed with incisive arrows enabling you to see Vali. [4-34-17]"
4-34-17,"Oh, Sugreeva, abide by your commitment. The path by which slain Vali has gone thatpath is not tapered off, as such do not tread Vali's path. [4-34-18]"
4-34-18,"Definitely you are not envisaging the Thunderbolt similar arrows from the bow ofthe best one from Ikshvaku dynasty, Rama, thereby you are enjoying luxuries joyously without givinga thought to Rama's mission even at your heart. [4-34-19]"
4-35-1,"Tara with her visage that shines like the Lord of Stars, namely the Moon, then spoke to the son of queen Sumitra, namely Lakshmana, who while he is speaking is as though blazing with his own resplendence. [4-35-1]"
4-35-2,"Let not this king of monkeys be addressed in this way, oh, Lakshmana, and he is not warranted to listen such tongue-lashing, especially from your tongue. [4-35-2]"
4-35-3,"Sugreeva is not an unthankful one, oh, brave Lakshmana, a treacherous one - no; a flagitious one - no; an utterer of untruth - no; a duplicitous one, no, this king of monkeys is not even that. [4-35-3]"
4-35-4,"Although he is a monkey this Sugreeva has not dismissed from his mind even the favour Rama has done in his respect, oh, valiant Lakshmana, which in combat is impractical for others. [4-35-4]"
4-35-5,"By the beneficence of Rama, oh, the enemy-scorcher Lakshmana, now Sugreeva is privileged with reputation, everlasting kingship of monkeys, more so with Ruma and me as well. [4-35-5]"
4-35-6,"Hitherto he has tolerated high anguish and on the attainment of this high comfort of kingship he has not oriented himself to the time-oriented actions as with saint Vishvamitra. [4-35-6]"
4-35-7,"Oh, Lakshmana, that great-sage Vishvamitra clinging together with Ghritaachi, an angelic apsara, for a period of ten years, forsooth that virtue-souled sage regarded that period as one day. [4-35-7]"
4-35-8,"When he who is a best one among the time-knowers, that great-resplendent Sage Vishvamitra himself is not privy to the occasioned time for a good many years, why talking about a commoner again. [4-35-8]"
4-35-9,"He who is overwrought and now undergoing natural bodily appetites, oh, Lakshmana, and who is overtired as he is absolutely discontent in the concupiscence, such as Sugreeva is, it will be apt of Rama to bear with him for a while. [4-35-9]"
4-35-10,"Without knowing realities, oh, young man Lakshmana, it will be extraneous of you to hastily enter into the control of your rancour like a commoner. [4-35-10]"
4-35-11,"Men of your kind having conscientiousness, oh, best one among men, do not hurriedly rush in and get clutched by their own rancour, unconscionably. [4-35-11]"
4-35-12,"I beg for your grace, oh, virtue-knower, in the interest of Sugreeva with all my equability, and you may dispel this clangour upshot in high dudgeon of yours. [4-35-12]"
4-35-13,"In the honour of Rama, Sugreeva will disown his wife Ruma, even me, even Angada, why us, he will disown whole kingdom with its riches, food grains, livestock and whatnot, as I can infer. [4-35-13]"
4-35-14,"On eliminating that worst demon Ravana, Sugreeva can bring Seetha together with Raghava, as with the coalescing of star Rohini with the Moon. [4-35-14]"
4-35-15,"It is said that the demons in Lanka are a trillion, plus thirty-six thousands of units of military, where one unit consists of a ten-thousand warriors, and hundreds and thousands of other demons are there, thus they say. [4-35-15]"
4-35-16,"Without eliminating those unassailable and guise changing demons, it is impracticable to eliminate him who has abducted Maithili, namely Ravana. [4-35-16]"
4-35-17,"Oh, Lakshmana, it is impossible to kill those demons, or that Ravana, the evil-doer and abductor of Seetha, without any assistance, more so to Sugreeva... [4-35-17]"
4-35-18,"This way Vali was saying and that king of monkeys is well-informed in these aspects, isn&#39;t it! But how Ravana mustered up these many troops is unclear to me, and I am saying what I heard from Vali. [4-35-18]"
4-35-19,"Intending that assistance to you in war, best monkeys are hastened in all directions, to muster up very many best of the best monkeys. [4-35-19]"
4-35-20,"Determined to achieve the objective of Raghava this king of monkeys Sugreeva has not bestirred himself while awaiting the return of those venturesome and very great mighty monkey-warriors who are sent out. [4-35-20]"
4-35-21,"According to the well-organised groundwork earlier made by Sugreeva, oh, Saumitri, all of those great-mighty monkeys have to arrive here today itself. [4-35-21]"
4-35-22,"Only today millions and millions of bears and hundredfold millions of baboons, and innumerable monkeys who by their own flare are like firebrands will arrive in your fore, oh, Lakshmana, thereby, oh, the enemy-repressor, therefore rebut your rage. [4-35-22]"
4-35-23,"On staring at this angry face of yours, and on gazing at the angrily bloodshot eyes of yours, unsecured is the peace to the females of monkeys chief, and with the fear caused at first by Vali&#39;s elimination we are all indeed premonished about such a happening in respect of Sugreeva too. [4-35-23]"
4-36-1,"In that way when Tara has submissively argued with words containing probity,Saumitri gave assent to her perspective as he is soft by his nature. [4-36-1]"
4-36-2,"And when Lakshmana conceded to that argument of Tara, Sugreeva, the king ofmonkey-troops, got rid of his highly intense scare of Lakshmana, like the riddance of a dampenedcloth. [4-36-2]"
4-36-3,"Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, then ripped apart the superb garland which is so farenwreathing his neck, and which has several strands according several gratifications, and he alsobecame sober as though the insobriety is ripped from his mind. [4-36-3]"
4-36-4,"Sugreeva who is the most powerful one among all vanara-s, then placatingly spokethis humble sentence to Lakshmana, whose prowess is most formidable. [4-36-4]"
4-36-5,"My prosperity, prominence and this perpetual kingdom of monkeys are once mislaid,but oh, Soumitri, I regained all this just by the beneficence of Rama. [4-36-5]"
4-36-6,"Who is capable of requiting Rama, oh, prince Lakshmana, even by a fraction of thatkind of inestimable help taken from him, as that lord is renowned by actions particular to himself,like daring and eliminating Vali."
4-36-7,"Who is capable of repudiating such a lordly Rama, even by a fraction of one's ownbravery, unless he is prepared to tread that kind of path on which Vali has gone. [4-36-6]"
4-36-8,"Virtue-souled Raghava reacquires Seetha, and even exterminates Ravana by himselfwith his own resplendence, while I and my assistance remain only in name. [4-36-7]"
4-36-9,"Basically, why some measures of succour need be extended to him who has rippedseven gigantic-trees, a mountain, and even the earth, all just with one arrow! [4-36-8]"
4-36-10,"He who outstretches his bow with a clangour by which the earth with its mountainsquakes, oh, Lakshmana, to him these aides are really of what aid, indeed! [4-36-9]"
4-36-11,"Lakshmana, I just can tread behind that king of people, Rama, on his charging toeliminate enemy Ravana along with all of his vanguards, that's all. [4-36-10]"
4-36-12,"If I have overstepped either in faith or friendliness, in the least, that may bepardoned for I am an attendant of yours. By the way, none is unoffending. [4-36-11]"
4-36-13,"Lakshmana is pleased with that great-souled Sugreeva who is speaking thus, and saidthis he said to him, indeed, in friendliness. [4-36-12]"
4-36-14,"In anyway, my brother indeed has a defender with him, oh, king of vanara-sSugreeva, especially you, who are a defender of your own word and a deferential one towards Rama.[4-36-13]"
4-36-15,"With this kind of preponderance and plainness you possess, Sugreeva, you are theonly merited one to enjoy this unexcelled kingdom of monkeys. [4-36-14]"
4-36-16,"Before long, Sugreeva, dauntless Rama will be eliminating enemies in a war with youas his supporter, there is no doubt about it. [4-36-15]"
4-36-17,"You are the knower of virtuousness and gratefulness and you do not retreat frombattlegrounds, or, on your own word, thus what you have said is conclusive as well as coherent.[4-36-16]"
4-36-18,"Even though one has capability to know his own lapse and speak it up, oh, ablestamong Vanara-s, who is he that behoves outspokenly, excepting my elder brother and you.[4-36-17]"
4-36-19,"You are a coequal to Rama by your valour and vigour and oh, best one among monkeys,gods have given you after a long time. [4-36-18]"
4-36-20,"However, you quickly start from here along with me, oh, brave one, and emboldenyour friend who is anguishing in the despoilment of his wife. [4-36-19]"
4-36-21,"Oh, friend, on hearing that which querulously spoken by Rama, who is downhearted inhis anguish, I too reflexively spoke bitter-words to you, and thus whatever I spoke that may bepardoned. [4-36-20]"
4-37-1,"When the great-souled Lakshmana spoke to Sugreeva in this way, Sugreeva spoke thisword to Hanuma who is available at his side. [4-37-1]"
4-37-2,"Convoke the Vaanara-s available on the summits of these five mountains, namely Mt.Mahendra, Mt. Himalaya, Mt. Vindhya, and Mt. Kailash and those that are on the whitish peak of Mt.Mandara. As well as those that are on the mountains at seashore, <font color=#B3003A"">udayaadri</font>, namely 'sunrise-mountain,' which mountains will always be dazzling with the tinge ofyouthful sun. And them that are on the mountains which shine in the ochry hue of evening clouds,<font color=""#B3003A"">asta adri</font>, namely 'sunset-mountain' and which mountains are situatedat the Palace of Sun. And the catastrophic monkey chiefs that are abiding in the palm groves of Mt.Padma. Also thus, the fly-jumpers who are similar to black-mascara and black-clouds in their shine,and who match elephants in their vigour, and who live on Mt. Anjana, they too are to be convened.Those fly-jumpers whose complexion will be golden and dwell in the caves of Great-Mountain, besidesthose who are on the mountainsides of Mt. Meru, and those biding on the Black-Red mountain, alongwith those topmost speeded fly-jumpers living on Mt. Great-Ochre swilling palm-toddy, these are tobe summoned. Further, the vanara-s who will be in the tinge of rising sun and who dwell in thehighly delightful, richly fragrant and lofty woodlands that are surrounded with the delightfulhermitages of sages are to be summoned. Along with them, the vanara-s who are in the interiors offorests, they are also to be called for. Why citing a few? Those and those monkeys that are on theearth, all of them are to be assembled. Oh, Hanuma, you quickly summon all of the topmost speededvanara-s by employing concessions, conciliations and the like procedures. [4-37-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8, 9]"
4-37-3,"In the first instance highly speedy vanara-s are hastened at my commanded, however,you hasten some more monkey chiefs for the purpose of hastening them. [4-37-10]"
4-37-4,"Those that are entangled with creature comforts, and those that are stringydawdlers, you quickly lead all of those monkey chiefs in here. [4-37-11]"
4-37-5,"And such of those vanara-s that do not arrive within ten days by my command, thosemiscreants are eliminable as the abusers of king's decree. [4-37-12]"
4-37-6,"Let all the lionly monkeys available on earth that abide by my control start comingto this place in hundreds, thousands, even in millions, by my command. [4-37-13]"
4-37-7,"The champions of monkeys with ghastly aspects and similar in shine with themountains and clouds shall start coming here by my command, fly-jumping as though to overcast thesky. [4-37-4]"
4-37-8,"Let those vanara-s who know the routes to the dwelling places of other monkeysexpeditiously proceed on quick-routes, and gather all of the monkeys available on earth at mycommand. Sugreeva ordered Hanuma that way. [4-37-15]"
4-37-9,"On hearing the order of Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, Hanuma, the son of Air-godhas started to dispatch valorous monkeys in all directions. [4-37-16]"
4-37-10,"In a split-second, the vanara-s that are sent by the king of vanara-s haveskyrocketed to the airways of birds and stars on their way, and indeed reached the vault of heaven,which was once trodden by Vishnu. [4-37-17]"
4-37-11,"After skyrocketing those monkeys have reached the monkeys that are living atseashores and islands, in the caves and crags of mountains, and at lakeshores and their surrounds,and motivated all of the monkeys available there towards the cause of Rama. [4-37-18]"
4-37-12,"On hearing that command of the king of kings of Vanara-s, Sugreeva, who is semblablewith the Death-god and Time-god, all of the monkeys have arrived with the terror of Sugreevahaunting them. [4-37-19]"
4-37-13,"Then thirty million fly-jumpers whose swiftness is inconceivable, and whose shine islike that of black-mascara have sallied forth from mountain Anjana to there where Raghava iscamping, i.e., Mt. Prasravana. [4-37-20]"
4-37-14,"Hundred million monkeys who take delight on the best mountain where the sun goesinto dusk, namely the westerly mountains, <font color=""#B3003A"">asta adri</font>, and whose hue issimilar to the refined gold, for dusk has a golden hue, have jumped in. [4-37-21]"
4-37-15,"Vanara-s who are in the hue of lion's mane have turned up in thousand crores, sayhundred billion, from the pinnacles of Mt. Kailash. [4-37-22]"
4-37-16,"Those that are sheltered on Himalayas subsisting on fruits and tubers have arrivedin a thousand of thousand crores, say a trillion. [4-37-23]"
4-37-17,"Millions and millions of Vanara-s whose looks and deeds are gruesome, and who equalthe planet Mars in their crimson-flush, as they dwell on the hotbeds of Mt. Vindhya, have swiftlyalighted from Mt. Vindhya. [4-37-24]"
4-37-18,"The count of those vanara-s who are basically domiciled at the coasts of milkyocean, the residents of Tamala woodlands, and those who feed on coconuts dwelling in coconutgroves, and who have presently come from those places is uncountable. [4-37-25]"
4-37-19,"That highly forceful military force of vanara-s has arrived from forests, cavernsand riversides with their leaping and bounding on the sky blocking up the sun as if they havegulped him down. [4-37-26]"
4-37-20,"The Vanara-s who went from Kishkindha to hasten up all the other monkeys of allquarters, those champions have reached Himalayan Mountains and saw exceptional trees on them.[4-37-27]"
4-37-21,"On that best and auspicious mountain, once a glorious Vedic-ritual intending GodShiva took place, which pleased the hearts of all gods. [4-37-28]"
4-37-22,"There the vanara-s have seen luscious tubers and fruits similar to nectar, whichhave originated from the oblational food material spattered in the Vedic-ritual for Shiva.[4-37-29]"
4-37-23,"If one eats for one time, a little of those divine and heart-pleasing fruits andtubers that have taken their origin from that oblational food material, he remains satiated for amonth. [4-37-30]"
4-37-24,"The best monkeys that are fruit-eaters have collected those divine fruits, tubers,and even the divine medicinal herbs. [4-37-31]"
4-37-25,"On going to the cardinal ground of Vedic-ritual which was performed once, thosevanara-s fetched highly fragrant flowers in order to please Sugreeva. [4-37-32]"
4-37-26,"On motivating all of the monkeys on earth, all those best monkeys who proceeded toforgather other monkeys, quickly returned to Kishkindha ahead of the forgathered troops of monkeys.[4-37-33]"
4-37-27,"Those quick paced monkeys quickly reached Kishkindha just at that moment whenLakshmana is still with Sugreeva, and those monkeys arrived at that place where Sugreeva isavailable along with Lakshmana. [4-37-34]"
4-37-28,"Taking the medicinal herbs, fruits, and tubers along with them, all of thoseVaanaras obliged Sugreeva to accept fruits, tubers and herbs as royal gifts, and they also spokethis word to Sugreeva. [4-37-35]"
4-37-29,"We have rounded up all the mountains, rivers, and forests even, and all of theVanara-s available on earth are fetched to your fore according to your command. Thus the monkeyssaid to Sugreeva. [4-37-36]"
4-37-30,"On listening these words then the king of fly-jumpers Sugreeva is gladdened andaccepted the gifts brought from Himalayas from all of them. [4-37-37]"
4-38-1,"On receiving all those gifts brought in by the Vanara-s from Himalayas, Sugreeva dispersed them all with approbation. [4-38-1]"
4-38-2,"On dispersing thousands of monkeys who have effectuated their errand of summoning all monkeys on the earth, Sugreeva deemed that his own aspirations and as well as those of that great-mighty Rama are achieved. [4-38-2]"
4-38-3,"Gladdening Sugreeva who is indomitably mighty and the indomitable one among all vanara-s, Lakshmana spoke these courteous words to him, oh, gentle one, if it please you, make an exit from Kishkindha. [4-38-3, 4a]"
4-38-4,"On hearing the courteous words of Lakshmana Sugreeva is extremely pleased and he indeed spoke this sentence to him, So be it. Let us go. I remain biddable in your command. [4-38-4b, 5]"
4-38-5,"Sugreeva speaking thus to Lakshmana, whose person itself is auspicious, then bade adieu to Lady Tara and the other female vanara-s. [4-38-6]"
4-38-6,"Sugreeva shouted sharply saying, come here, at the best monkey-adjutants and on hearing his call all of those monkeys that are spared to see the ladies of palace chambers have come there swiftly with their palms adjoined in supplication. [4-38-7]"
4-38-7,"Then the king Sugreeva whose refulgence is kindred to that of sun has said to those vanara-s that have arrived there, oh, vanara-s, immediately position my palanquin before me. [4-38-8b, 9a]"
4-38-8,"On hearing his words those monkeys who are the adept ones in their agility right away brought an exquisite palanquin and readily started to position it at his nearby. [4-38-9b, 10a]"
4-38-9,"And on seeing palanquin positioned at his nearby the king of monkeys Sugreeva said to Saumitri, you mount it, Lakshmana, be quick. [4-38-10b, 11a]"
4-38-10,"Saying so Sugreeva got into that golden carriage which in shine is like the sun and which has many monkey-carriers along with Lakshmana. [4-38-11b, 12a]"
4-38-11,"Sugreeva who achieved the kingdom of unexcelled magnificence has started out that magnificently to the high extolment of panegyrists, while a white royal-parasol spread overhead the palanquin, white fur-fans fanning him from all over, and while conch-shells are blowing loud and drums are drumming high. [4-38-12b, 13, 14a]"
4-38-12,"Sugreeva travelled thus surrounded with many hundreds of vanara-s, who look confrontational and who wielded weapons, to the place where Rama is staying. [4-38-14b, 15a]"
4-38-13,"On reaching the province where Rama is staying in all his adoration to that place, the great-resplendent Sugreeva descended the palanquin along with Lakshmana. [4-38-15b, 16a]"
4-38-14,"When Sugreeva reached Rama he stood still with adjoined-palms, and when he remained still with palm-fold all the other monkeys stood still with palm-fold. [4-38-16b, 17a]"
4-38-15,"Rama became exultant of Sugreeva on seeing the massive army of Vanara-s which is just like a vast lake plethoric with buds of lotuses. [4-38-17b, 18a]"
4-38-16,"Raghava raised and tightly hugged the king of monkeys Sugreeva, who has prostrated himself with his head touching the feet of Rama, with care and credit. [4-38-18b, 19a]"
4-38-17,"After hugging Sugreeva that virtue-souled Rama then said to him, be seated. Then on seeing Sugreeva who took seat on ground Rama spoke to him. [4-38-19b, 20a]"
4-38-18,"He alone is the king, oh, valiant Sugreeva, who always divides time for devoting himself to probity, prosperity and pleasure-seeking. [4-38-20b, 21a]"
4-38-19,"If one devotes himself to pleasure-seeking alone, casting off the probity and like that the prosperity also, he is like the one who slept on a treetop who awakens only after falling down. [4-38-21b, 22a]"
4-38-20,"And the king who is bound up in eliminating unfriendly ones and bound up with forgathering friends, he will be enjoined with righteousness, and he even becomes the real enjoyer of the fruit of threefold virtues, namely<font color=""#B3003A"">dharma, artha, kaama</font> - probity, prosperity and pleasures. [4-38-22b, 23a]"
4-38-21,"Oh, enemy-eliminator, time for endeavour has come, oh, king of monkeys, let this be discussed along with your monkey-ministers. Thus Rama spoke to Sugreeva. [4-38-23b, 24a]"
4-38-22,"When Rama addressed him in this way, Sugreeva said these words to Rama, oh, dextrous Rama, by your beneficence I have repossessed prosperity, popularity and this everlasting kingdom of monkeys which are actually mislaid. [4-38-24b, 25]"
4-38-23,"Oh, god, by your and your brother&#39;s benevolence alone I regained what I lost, oh, victorious one among victors, and he who does not requite the favour that has been done for him will become the vitiator of probity among men. [4-38-26]"
4-38-24,"These are the hundreds of vanara chiefs, oh, enemy-subjugator, who have just returned on forgathering all of the forceful vanara-s on earth. [4-38-27]"
4-38-25,"Oh, Raghava, the legatee of Raghu, those vanara-s with dreadful appearance, and who are the experts in permeating the impenetrable forests, woodlands and impassable mountains are coming. And the bears, monkeys and brave baboons who are the children of gods and gandharva-s, and who change their guise just by their wish are halfway through on their path duly fenced round with one&#39;s own forces. [4-38-28, 29]"
4-38-26,"Oh, king, some of the fly-jumpers that are arriving are with a hundred-legion, some with a hundred-thousand legion, and even some with millions of legions, while the some are on the way with specific legions like aayuta-s, shanku-s. And oh, valiant one Rama, some with legions of arbuda-s, and some with hundreds of arbuda-s, some with madhya-s, and some with antaH-s are coming. Some more are coming with samudra-s and some with paraardha-s legions of monkeys. Oh, enemy-flamer Rama, the legions of monkeys along with their monkey commanders who are viable to Mahendra in valour, and who compare with massive clouds and mountains, and who domiciled on Mt. Meru and Mt. Vindhya will be coming in your service. [4-38-30, 31, 32]"
4-38-27,"Those vanara-s who are combative in wars, and those who can fetch Maithili on eliminating Ravana in war, will be approaching you soon. Thus Sugreeva informed Rama. [4-38-33]"
4-38-28,"Then on seeing the perfect effort made by the prominent one among all monkeys, Sugreeva, who is operating under his control, the eyes of valorous prince Rama are widened in jubilance, like the well-bloomed blue-lotuses. [4-38-34]"
4-39-1,"Rama, the best proponent of probity, happily embraced Sugreeva with both of his arms and replied him who is speaking in this way suppliantly adjoining palms at Rama. [3-39-1]"
4-39-2,"There is no wonder, oh, enemy-flamer, if Indra gives rain, or if that thousand-rayed sun makes the sky undark, or if the moon makes night shiny with his moonshine, so also oh, gentle one, if a true-friend of your kind gladdens his indigent-friend, there is no wonder. [3-39-2, 3]"
4-39-3,"In this way, oh, nice Sugreeva, that helpful nature which is decorously prevailing in you, ushering you for organising the worthwhile, will not be a wonder but natural. I am aware that you have always been the exponent of affability. [3-39-4]"
4-39-4,"With you as the helmsman, oh, friend, I will be triumphing over all the enemies, and you alone are worthy to proffer a helping hand to me as a good-hearted friend of mine. [3-39-5]"
4-39-5,"That knavish demon Ravana deceitfully carried off Vaidehi for his own extinction, as demon Anuhlaada carried off Sachi Devi, the daughter of Puloma. [3-39-6]"
4-39-6,"As soon as possible I wish to eliminate that Ravana with sharp arrows, as has been done by the enemy slyer Indra when he eliminated the insolent father of Sachi Devi, namely Puloma. Thus Rama is about to tell other things to Sugreeva, but... [3-39-7]"
4-39-7,"In the meanwhile dust started to overcast the sky covering the intensely scorching radiation of the sun. [3-39-8]"
4-39-8,"Stained with that darkness the directions are confounded, and the entire earth together with its mountains, woods, and forests has wobbled. [3-39-9]"
4-39-9,"In a split-second the entire ground is then enshrouded with incalculable fly-jumpers whose size is mountainous, fangs excruciating, and might abnormal, and each monkey commander is surrounded with hundreds of millions of legions of monkeys, who by their wish can change of their guise, and these monkeys of amazing strength have come crashing war-whoops as clouds letting out thunders while they are on their way from their habitation like riversides, seashores, mountains, and some other monkeys have come from forests as they are forest dwellers, and in the vast of masses their complexion alone remained as an identity to their habitation, like the stripe of tender-sun of some monkeys is marking them from the place of rising sun, moon-white body colour of some more telling that they are from the place of nightly moon, and the colour of skin looking like lotus-fibrils of many more indicates that they are from fertile watery lands, and the snow-white complexion of yet some more indicates that the dwelling place of those monkeys is Mt. Meru. [3-39-10, 11, 12, 13]"
4-39-10,"In the meantime the arrival of a distinguished and valorous vanara named Shatabali, hemmed in with ten thousand crores of vanara-s, came into the view of Rama and others. [3-39-14]"
4-39-11,"Sushena, the father of Lady Tara, a valorous one with the sheen of golden mountain then appeared with very many thousands of crores of vanara-s. [3-39-15]"
4-39-12,"Like that the most efficient vanara-chief Taara, the father of Ruma and Sugreeva&#39;s father-in-law, turned up with another thousand crores of vanara-s following him. [3-39-16]"
4-39-13,"Honourable Kesari, the father of Hanuma, with his bodily gleam like that of the fibrils of lotuses and visage glittering in the gleam of nascent sun, and who is an intellectual, graceful and prominent vanara among all the vanara-s, then came into view associated with thousands and thousands of armies of vanara-s. [3-39-17]"

4-44-1,"Sugreeva expressly broached the topic of searching Seetha with Hanuma, as Sugreeva is decidedly determined about Hanuma, because that best one among monkeys, namely Hanuma, alone is decidedly the achiever of purpose. [4-44-1]"
4-44-2,"The king of all the residents of forest Sugreeva is well pleased to pick and choose Hanuma for the purpose, and spoke to the venturesome son of Air-god, Hanuma. [4-44-2]"
4-44-3,"Oh, foremost monkey, Hanuma, I do not foresee any impediment in your transit on land where homogenous enemies will usually obstruct one another, or in high skies where there is no foothold, thus only birds and clouds hover there, or in the wild blue yonder where celestial bodies alone gravitate at random, nor in waters where there is no underwater movement for earthly beings, nor in the heaven, the abodes of immortals, where those immortals will not allow mortals like us to meander as we like. [4-44-3]"
4-44-4,"All the worlds that contain demons, gandharva-s, naaga-s, humans, gods, and the oceans and mountains therein are known to you. [4-44-4]"
4-44-5,"With your unusual mobility, unstoppable celerity, unremitting vivacity, and untold ability you are identical to your father Maaruti, the Air-god of marvelling dynamism. [4-44-5]"
4-44-6,"Or even by your radiancy none on earth is coming to mind who can be a coequal of yours, thereby you alone shall think about that process as to how to access Seetha. [4-44-6]"
4-44-7,"Oh, Hanuma, in you alone there are brawniness, astuteness and venturesomeness, and oh, ethicist, you conduct yourself in abidance with time, place and ethicality. Thus Sugreeva said to Hanuma. [4-44-7]"
4-44-8,"Raghava started pondaration when he is cognisant of the entrustment of the task to Hanuma and on cognising Hanuma as an efficient cause. [4-44-8]"
4-44-9,"This king of monkeys, Sugreeva, is anywise definitive in his resolve reposed in Hanuma, and Hanuma is definitely resolute in achieving the task. [4-44-9]"
4-44-10,"By that reason Hanuma must have good track record of the tasks he accomplished earlier, besides, he is specifically chosen by his king. As such, this Hanuma will certainly bring task to fruition."
4-44-11,"This Sugreeva is well-aware of each individual&#39;s accomplishments and hence he specifically chose Hanuma, and Hanuma who is now transiting must be individually well-known for accomplishment of any task assigned to him. Hence the fruition of the task is certain. Thus, Rama pondered. [4-44-10]"
4-44-12,"On perusing Hanuma who is the ablest one in his endeavours, the highly resplendent Rama is immensely delighted, and his heart and senses are elated as if his purpose has been achieved. [4-44-11]"
4-44-13,"Then that enemy-inflamer Rama happily gave his ring that is shining forth with his own name engraved as sign to Hanuma, as a remembrancer for princess Seetha. [4-44-12]"
4-44-14,"By this emblematic ring, oh, best monkey, Janaka&#39;s daughter Seetha identifies you to have reached her from my proximity, without apprehension. [4-44-13]"
4-44-15,"Oh, brave one, your enthusiasm, vital-force combined with your venturesomeness, and also the message of Sugreeva to you, are as if heralding achievement to me. Thus, Rama spoke to Hanuma while giving his ring. [4-44-14]"
4-44-16,"On taking the ring that foremost monkey Hanuma kept it on his own head, and making palm-fold he reverenced the feet of Rama, and then that noteworthy monkey started off. [4-44-15]"
4-44-17,"That brave monkey-son of Air-god leapt to sky along with that massive force of monkeys as if he is hauling them up, and he who is brightened by monkeys around him on the skyscape appeared like the moon in a very clear lunar sphere on a cloudless sky brightened by clusters of stars around. [4-44-16]"
4-44-18,"Oh, highly powerful Hanuma, I rely upon your vivacity, being the best venturesome monkey, oh, son of Air-god, showing your adventures that are not inconsequential you make happen as to how access can be gained to Janaka&#39;s daughter, Seetha. Thus, Rama shouted at Hanuma flying in the sky. [4-44-17]"
4-45-1,"On calling forth all the fly-jumpers for achieving the purpose of Rama's task thebest fly-jumper and the king of monkeys Sugreeva spoke to all of them, ""oh, best vanara-s, youshall search all of this earth as I have detailed."" Sugreeva said so to all monkeys. [4-45-1,2a]"
4-45-2,"Understanding that arduous order of the king of monkeys Sugreeva those best monkeysstarted out covering the earth like grasshoppers. [4-45-2, 3a]"
4-45-3,"Rama remained on that Mt. Prasravana along with Lakshmana looking forward to thatmonth which is marked for locating Seetha. [4-45-3b, 4a]"
4-45-4,"Then the brave monkey Shatabali swiftly started towards the beautiful northernquarter that is encompassed by the king of mountains, namely Himavanta. [4-45-4b, 5a]"
4-45-5,"The monkey-troop commander Vinata journeyed towards the eastern direction, and thefly-jumper, leader of monkeys and Air-god's son Hanuma travelled towards southerly quarter that isonce trodden by Sage Agastya, along with Lt. Tara, Prince-regent Angada, and others. [4-45-5b,6]"
4-45-6,"The commander of fly-jumpers and a tigerly monkey Sushena started out towards thehorrifying western direction that is ruled by Varuna, the Rain-god. [4-45-7]"
4-45-7,"Then on disposing the commanders of monkey army to all directions according to theircapabilities, that valorous king Sugreeva who is contented earlier by way of gaining his kingdomthrough Rama, is now gladdened to his heart's content for sending monkey troops to all directionsas a requital to Rama's help. [4-45-8]"
4-45-8,"In this way when despatched by their king Sugreeva all the vanara lieutenantsexpeditiously started towards one's own direction. [4-45-9]"
4-45-9,"When those great mighty fly-jumpers have started to dash off some are bawling, somehighly blaring, some more thundering, and some more oddly bellowing, while some more are roaringlike lions. [4-45-10]"
4-45-10,"Well-motivated this way by the king Sugreeva those vanara lieutenants put theirfortitude into boastful words and said, ""we lead forth Seetha, we wish to kill Ravana.""[4-45-11]"
4-45-11,"I will kill Ravana single-handedly if he chances on battlefield, and then ondrubbing the other demons I will quickly bring back Janaka's daughter, Seetha. Another monkeysoldier said so. [4-45-12]"
4-45-12,"I alone will bring back Janaki even from netherworlds, who might be shivering owingto enervation, and you my monkey-soldier colleagues, you all may stay behind now. Thus anothermonkey-hero said. [4-45-13]"
4-45-13,"I will completely shatter the trees, shred the mountains, split the earth and stormthe oceans. Thus another monkey gave war cry. [4-45-14]"
4-45-14,"I can fly-jump a hundred yojana-s, undoubtedly, said one monkey while the othersaid, ""I can jump even more than a hundred yojana-s, for sure."" [4-45-15]"
4-45-15,"My transit cannot be thwarted either on the plane of earth, or in the ocean, or onmountains or in forests, or in the netherworld, or in its core. This is the slogan of anothermonkey-warrior. [4-45-16]"
4-45-16,"Thus each individual vanara gave war-whoops with the proper proud of his might inthe audience of monkeys king Sugreeva and departed. [4-45-17]"
4-46-1,"When the chiefs of monkey-troops are on their way Rama spoke to Sugreeva, Indeed, how do you know very-well about the globe of earth in its entirety? [4-46-1]"
4-46-2,"Then Sugreeva bowing down before Rama said, I will narrate all vividly, and let my words be heard. [4-46-2]"
4-46-3,"When Vali repulsed the buffalo-shaped demon Dundubhi towards Malaya mountain, then that buffalo entered the cave of Mt. Malaya, and even Vali entered therein wishing to kill that buffalo. [4-46-3, 4]"
4-46-4,"Vali then kept me at the mouth of the cave as I was an amenable brother, but Vali did not exit from cave even after one full year. [4-46-5]"
4-46-5,"I was dumbfounded to see that cave is then fully filled with blood, and then a venom like anguish called the loss of my brother agonised me. [4-46-6]"
4-46-6,"Then I concluded that &#39;my brother is unmistakably killed,&#39; and then I fixed a mountain similar boulder in the mouth of that cavity with a thinking that it will be impossible for that buffalo to exit and it will get destroyed within that cave itself. [4-46-7, 8a]"
4-46-7,"Unhopeful of Vali&#39;s aliveness then I arrived in Kishkindha, and on getting the very magnificent kingdom of Kishkindha, and also Ruma along with Tara, I was peaceably staying there with friends. [4-46-8, 9]"
4-46-8,"Vali then came back to Kishkindha on killing that great demon, and then I was spellbound in fear of Vali&#39;s killing me, and I gave back the kingdom to Vali owing to my deference to him. [4-46-10]"
4-46-9,"That evil-minded Vali becoming highly perturbed at his senses furiously repulsed me further and further away, even though I was running away from him with my ministers, as he wished to kill me. [4-46-11]"
4-46-10,"Such as I was, who is repulsed by Vali, I was made to run away rapidly, and during that fleeing I went on seeing diverse rivers, forests and cities. [4-46-12]"
4-46-11,"I have then really seen the earth as in the reflection on the surface of a mirror, where the mirror shows all the objects in exactness, and the earth is like the circle of a fireball, where it is encircled with fire-like reddish, brownish, ochreish minerals and ores, and it appeared to me in my high flight like a cow-hoof-print in the mirror, called my perception. [4-46-13]"
4-46-12,"Then on going to eastern direction I saw various trees, enchanting mountains with caves, and also numerous lakes. [4-46-14]"
4-46-13,"There I saw the mountain wreathed in with ores, namely Mt. Udaya, the Sun-Rise, and I have also seen the Milk Water Oceans which is forever an abode for apsara-s. [4-46-15]"
4-46-14,"I fled speedily when Vali repulsed me, but oh, lord Rama, when I returned he again made me to flee forthwith. [4-46-16]"
4-46-15,"Then from that eastern direction I fled to southern direction, which is thick with Vindhya Range mountains and diverse trees, especially with sandalwood trees. [4-46-17]"
4-46-16,"While I was seeing the interiors of forest and mountains again I was made to run by Vali, who was setting upon me from within the interiors of those forests and mountains, and then I reached the western direction. [4-46-18]"
4-46-17,"Such as I was, on seeing diverse cities and the best mountain Astagiri, Mt. Dusk, I reached that excellent Mt. Dusk also, and since Vali is at my heel, I took to my heels, by a long way to north. [4-46-19]"
4-46-18,"Even at Himalayas, Mt. Meru, like that at the Northern Ocean, Vali drove me back, and when the clemency from Vali, or a shelter, or even a foothold on earth was indeterminable, then Hanuma, whose prosperity is his wisdom, said a word to me. [4-46-20, 21a]"
4-46-19," &#39;Oh, king Sugreeva, now I remember how Sage Matanga cursed the king of monkeys Vali at that time. If Vali really enters the fringes of the hermitage of Sage Matanga, Vali&#39;s head gets splintered in hundred ways. Hence dwelling in sage Matanga&#39;s hermitage will be peaceful and imperturbable for us.&#39; Thus Hanuma spoke to me. [4-46-21b, 22, 23a]"
4-46-20,"Oh, prince Rama, then Vali though reached Mt. Rishyamuka, he did not enter into its precincts at that time fearing Sage Matanga and his curse, oh, king Rama, thus this globe of earth is apparently and closely sighted by me in its entirety, and then I came into the cave of Rishyamuka and did not stir out. So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-46-23b, 24]"
4-47-1,"As commanded by the king of monkeys Sugreeva all of the elephantine monkeys essayedeverywhere with post-hast for a glimpse of Vaidehi. [4-47-1]"
4-47-2,"Those monkeys have thoroughly searched at lakes, in the pens of creepers onriverbanks, in vacant lands and in crowded cities and at impassable places with rivers andmountains. [4-47-2]"
4-47-3,"All the monkey commanders explicitly commanded by Sugreeva, very carefully searched all the provinces inclusive of mountains,woodlands, and thick forests of those provinces. [4-47-3]"
4-47-4,"All the Vanara-s firmed up in finding Seetha have searched nooks and corners ofearth by day, and at nighttimes they used to come together onto earth at scheduled places.[4-47-4]"
4-47-5,"In all those days those Vanara-s used to come to trees which have fruits of allseasons, to make those trees as their beds at bedtime. [4-47-5]"
4-47-6,"Counting the day of their starting as day one, those elephantine monkeys returned toMt. Prasavana within one month, hopeless of Seetha, and met Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, who iswith Rama awaiting the return of monkeys. [4-47-6]"
4-47-7,"Cmdr. Vinata, the great-mighty vanara, came back after searching eastern quarter asSugreeva had advised, but without finding Seetha there. [4-47-7]"
4-47-8,"Even the valiant and matchless monkey Shatabali explored whole of the northerndirection along with his army, but he too came back as Seetha is undiscovered there. [4-47-8]"
4-47-9,"Sushena, the father-in-law of Sugreeva, searching whole of western quarter alongwith vanara-s, but not finding Seetha there, he came back when one month is completed, andapproached Sugreeva. [4-47-9]"
4-47-10,"All of the expeditionists have reached and venerated Sugreeva who is sitting alongwith Rama on the peak of Mt. Prasavana and spoke this to him. [4-47-10]"
4-47-11,"All of the mountains, all of the serried forests, all of the riversides up to theedge of oceans, likewise, all of the inhabitations have been searched. [4-47-11]"
4-47-12,"Those caves that were explicitly extolled by you, they are all thoroughly searched,and immense shrubby hutches that are thickly entwined with climber plants have also been rummaged.[4-47-12]"
4-47-13,"Search is conducted in the compacted, lopsided, and impenetrable provinces, andcolossal beings are hunted out and killed presuming that Ravana might have assumed those oddshapes, and the impassable provinces are searched high and low, time and again. [4-47-13]"
4-47-14,"Hanuma is high-born and exceptionally mighty, oh, Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s,he will ascertain about Maithili, because the son of Air-god, Hanuma, resorted to the direction inwhich Seetha is taken away. Thus, monkey chiefs reported to their king Sugreeva. [4-47-14]"
4-48-1,"Hanuma, the monkey, quickly started along with Angada, Lt. Tara, and others to thatprovince which Sugreeva has indicated, namely the south. [4-48-1]"
4-48-2,"Arriving at a remote place with all of those powerful monkeys, then Hanuma searchedthe caves and forests of Vindhya Mountains, and on their mountaintops, at impassable places, atrivers and lakes, and in stands of trees with beamy trees, also on diverse mountains, forests andtrees. [4-48-2, 3]"
4-48-3,"Though all of those brave vanara-s have searched in all directions they have notnoticed the princess of Mithila and the daughter of Janaka, namely Seetha. [4-48-4]"
4-48-4,"Feeding upon unalike fruits and tubers, sojourning here and there, thoseinvulnerable vanara-s conducted their search. [4-48-5]"
4-48-5,"But that province is an inscrutable one, deeply caved, deeply forested, much less ofwater and still less of people, a void and an impenetrable one with a ghastly look. [4-48-6]"
4-48-6,"They are highly tormented when they vainly searched there, and even in anotherprovince that is also of the same kind, waterless and people-less, and an unreachable one,abstrusely caved and forested. [4-48-7]"
4-48-7,"Then all of those monkey commanders gave up that province and entered anotherimpermeable province as they are fearless from any quarter. [4-48-8]"
4-48-8,"Whereat the trees are infertile for fruiting, destitute of leaves and flowers, andwhereat the brooks are deprived of waters, and whereat it is highly impossible to get even tubers,there they entered. [4-48-9]"
4-48-9,"Where there are no buffalos, no elephants, no animals, nor even birds or tigers, orno other forest moving beings are there, for they do not have their feed there, they entered such aprovince. [4-48-10]"
4-48-10,"Where there are no useful trees, nor herbal plants, nor climbing plants on trees,nor creeping plants on earth, and lotus-lakes which will be normally pleasing for sight have nosoft leaves, nor bloomed lotuses on their creepers, and even honeybees are discarding them as theyare not richly fragranced, in such a province those vanara-s have entered. [4-48-11,12a]"
4-48-11,"A highly fortunate, veracious, ascetically wealthy sage known as Kandu is there inthat province, and that great sage is a highly short-tempered, and an impossible one to subjugateby virtue of his own self-discipline. [4-48-12b, 13a]"
4-48-12,"In that forest that sage lost his son, a ten-year-old boy, as that boy's life endedthere by which that great sage is infuriated. [4-48-13b, 14a]"
4-48-13,"Thereby that virtue-souled sage cursed that great forest in it entirety to become anuninhabitable and impermeable forest abandoned by birds and animals. [4-48-14b, 15a]"
4-48-14,"But those monkeys conscientiously searched such a forest up to its fringes,including its mountains, caves, fountains, and rivers. [4-48-15b, 16a]"
4-48-15,"But not finding the daughter of Janaka or even her kidnapper Ravana there, thosemonkeys who are the perfecters of that which is acceptable to Sugreeva, have entered anotherfearsome forest. [4-48-16b, 17a]"
4-48-16,"On entering another fearsome forest which is overly encompassed with climbers andshrubberies they saw a demon of fiendish deeds who is fearless of gods. [4-48-17b, 18a]"
4-48-17,"All of those vanara-s are amazed to see that fiendish demon standing similar to amountainous boulder, and apprehending an imminent danger on observing that mountain similar demon,those vanara-s have tightly girthed their wrestler's girdle-cloth. [4-48-18b, 19a]"
4-48-18,"Even that mighty demon shouting at all vanara-s, 'you are all dead... stay,' rushedtowards them shoving up his clenched fist. [4-48-19b, 20a]"
4-48-19,"Angada, the son of Vali, then presumed him who is onrushing as Ravana and saying,'he is Ravana...' he quickly thwacked that demon indeed with his palm. [4-48-20b, 21a]"
4-48-20,"When Vali's son whacked him that demon spewed forth blood from his throat and fellonto ground alike an inverted mountain. [4-48-21b, 22a]"
4-48-21,"When that demon breathed his last all of those monkeys with triumphal shimmer havewellnigh searched everywhere, and even in that cave of that mountain where that demon appeared,presuming that cave belonged to Ravana. [4-48-22b, 23a]"
4-48-22,"Then all those forest dwelling monkeys searched everywhere else, and like that theyentered another horrible cave which is nearby. [4-48-23b, 24a]"
4-48-23,"On searching that cave they came out saddened as their search is futile, and comingtogether they sat down at the base of a lonely tree downheartedly as their efforts are unsuccessfulin searching Seetha. [4-48-24]"
4-49-1,"Then on comforting all of those vanara-s the highly diligent one but overly tiredAngada slowly spoke this word to them. [4-49-1]"
4-49-2,"We in oneness have searched there and thereabouts in the impassable forests,mountains, and rivers, and unfathomable cavities and in mountain caves up to their end, but we havenot seen Janaki, so also that ill-natured demon, the abductor of Seetha, is not seen. [4-49-2,3]"
4-49-3,"We started a long time back and a great deal of time is lapsed, and Sugreeva is asevere disciplinarian, therefore let the search continued everywhere collectively. [4-49-4]"
4-49-4,"Surrender not to sluggishness, submit not to sorrowfulness, slouch not to sleep, asthese lethargies are presently have come up against you. Let all of you search in such a way howbest we can find the daughter of Janaka, Seetha. [4-49-5]"
4-49-5,"Insistency, ingenuity and indomitability of heart are said to be the causes forachieving results, therefore I am speaking all this. [4-49-6]"
4-49-6,"Even now the forest dwellers can search this impenetrable forest, thus get rid ofyour rue and let all of this forest be searched in its entirety. [4-49-7]"
4-49-7,"Fruit of pursuit will definitely be evident for those who undertake an endeavourearnestly, on the other hand, it will be unforgivable to shut our eyes deriving a high dejection.[4-49-8]"
4-49-8,"King Sugreeva is irascible and he is a ruthful persecutor too, oh, vanara-s, weshall always be frightened of him, and of self-reliant Rama as well. [4-49-9]"
4-49-9,"All this is being said in the interest of your well-being, and if it is obliging toyou it may be done in this way as I have said, if not, any other way out is there which will beconducive for all of us, oh, vanara-s, it may be said. Thus Angada spoke to the troops of monkeys.[4-49-10]"
4-49-10,"On hearing Angada's words, Gandhamaadana who is enervated with thirst and fatiguespoke this sentence with inexplicit words. [4-49-11]"
4-49-11,"What Angada has said that is indeed appropriate, isn't it! It is advantageous andpragmatic also. Let us carry out as said by him. [4-49-12]"
4-49-12,"Again let us search out mountains, caves, crags, also like that the uninhabitedforests and mountain rapids, too. [4-49-13]"
4-49-13,"Let us all collectively search all of the places with forests, mountains and gorgesas indicated by that self-assertive Sugreeva. Thus Gandhamaadana spoke to all monkeys.[4-49-14]"
4-49-14,"Those great-mighty vanara-s again perking themselves up searched the southerncompass that is overspread with Vindhya forests. [4-49-15]"
4-49-15,"Those vanara-s who are the best among monkeys who are desirous of getting a glanceof Seetha have clambered up a magnificent Silver Mountain which in statuesque is like an autumnalsilvery cloud, and which has many zeniths and caverns, and searched there in the delightful woodsof Lodhra trees, and even in the groves of seven-leaved banana plants. [4-49-16, 17]"
4-49-16,"Though they searched everywhere on ascending the mountaintop they have not foundSeetha, the dear queen of Rama, and though they are immensely venturesome they are fatigued.[4-49-18]"
4-49-17,"On searching what all they could see all over on that many caved mountain thosemonkeys descended yet keeping an eye on all over that mountain. [4-49-19]"
4-49-18,"Then on climbing down the mountain they reached ground and became tired and inane,and staying there for moment they took shelter at the base of a tree. [4-49-20]"
4-49-19,"They took respite for a moment and when their laboriousness intermitted a little,again they ventured to search the southern direction in its entirety. [4-49-21]"
4-49-20,"Again making Mt. Vindhya as the starting point of search, those best fly-jumpers,namely Hanuma and the other chieftains of vanara-s, have searched all over the southern directionfor Seetha. [4-49-22]"
4-50-1,"Associated with Angada, Lt. Tara and others, the monkey Hanuma searched the cavesand thick forests of Vindhya Range. [4-50-1]"
4-50-2,"Hanuma has searched in the caves of that kingly Mt. Vindhya, which are jammed inwith lions and tigers, and even at the towering rapids. [4-50-2, 3a]"
4-50-3,"They reached the southwest peak of that mountain during their search and the timeset by Sugreeva swiftly lapsed while they are overstaying thereat that Mt. Vindhya alone."
4-50-4,"Though that extensive province is indeed an unsearchable one with its impenetrablecaves and forests, yet Hanuma, the son of Air-god, searched everywhere on that mountain. [4-50-3b,4]"
4-50-5,"Without pressing one another closely, yet not distancing from one another largely,Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, also thus Mainda, Dvivida, and Hanuma, and evenJaambavanta, crown prince Angada, also the forest-mover Lt. Tara have searched that province insouthern direction that is encompassed with interlocked mountains, and during their search therethey have observed a wide-opened and impassable cavity known as Riksha cavity which is well guardedby a demon called Maya. [4-50-5, 6, 7, 8a]"
4-50-6,"Thirst and hunger invading them they are fatigued and craving for water, and such asthey are they beheld that capacious cavity which is enwrapped in climbers and trees. [4-50-8,9a]"
4-50-7,"There they have seen the swans and the waterfowls like Kraunca, Saarasa, and evenCakravaka waterfowls exiting from the cavity with their bodies drenched in water and reddened withthe dapples of lotuses' pollen. [4-50-9b, 10a]"
4-50-8,"When those best vanara-s have neared that fragrant and impermeable cavity they aredisheartened with amazement. [4-50-10b, 11a]"
4-50-9,"Though a suspicion in general is evoked in them, as they presumed that cavity to beNaraka, The Hell of Yama, or Paataala, the Netherworld of Emperor Bali, those highly resplendentand great mighty fly-jumpers have neared it, rejoicing for the availability of water in there.[4-50-11b, 12a]"
4-50-10,"That hideous cavity is dispersed with diverse beings, similar to the residence ofthe emperor of demons, namely Emperor Bali, in Paataala, the Netherworld, and it is unsightly andimpermeable from anywhere. [4-50-12b, 13a]"
4-50-11,"The son of Air-god Hanuma whose glossiness is like that of a mountaintop and who isa mastermind in scrutinising every inscrutable forest, then spoke to all of the formidableVanara-s. [4-50-13b, 14a]"
4-50-12,"We all have searched the southern quarter including those places that are enmeshedwith meshes of mountains, and we are overly fatigued, but Maithili is unnoticed. [4-50-14b,15a]"
4-50-13,"Swans along with waterfowls like Saarasa, Kruanca, and water drenched Cakravakabirds are coming out of this cavity from all over, and even the trees available at its doorway areverdant. Certainly there must be a wellspring, or otherwise a pond with water. Thus Hanuma spoketo all monkeys. [4-50-15b, 16, 17a]"
4-50-14,"When Hanuma spoke to them thus as a kind of assurance, all those monkeys entered thecavity and found it as a sunless or moonless cavity, enfolded in hair-raising darkness. [4-50-17b,18a]"
4-50-15,"Those tigerly monkeys have also seen lions and various other animals and birdsexiting therefrom, and entered that cavity which is enshrouded in obscurity. [4-50-18b, 19a]"
4-50-16,"Their eyesight, or their vigour, or their valorousness is rendered ineffectual, andtheir permeation is just like the directionless air as their eyesight is thwarted ingloominess."
4-50-17,"Despite of the gloominess of that cavity, unobstructed is their eyesight, or theirvigour or their valorousness, and their permeation is like that of the gust of air as theireyesight is actuated even in darkness. [4-50-19, 20a]"
4-50-18,"But on their going further into that cavity speedily, those elephantine monkeysbeheld a best place that is luminous, as well as lovely. [4-50-20b, 21a]"
4-50-19,"In that awful cave that is compacted with various trees, then they advanced furtheran interstice of yojana distance, hand in hand lest one may miss the other. [4-50-21b, 22a]"
4-50-20,"Though they are craving for water, highly perplexed, and lost track of theirdestination or any waterway, and yet hopeful of their mission they unwearyingly hopped in thatcavity for a good while. [4-50-22b, 23a]"
4-50-21,"Those fly-jumpers are presently enervated and overly tired, and sad faced, and whenthose brave ones are despaired of their life, just then they perceived a luminescence. [4-50-23b,24a]"
4-50-22,"Those amenable monkeys on arriving at that province then beheld a shadowlesswoodland with golden trees which in irradiance is like the irradiated Ritual-fire. They beheldSaala, Taala [Palmyra,] Tamaala trees and some flowered trees like Punnaaga, Vanjula, Dhava,Campaka, Naaga, also Karnikaara trees. The bunches of their flowers are golden and amazing,leaflets are reddish, and like that the climbers enwreathing at their tops are like their toweringdiadems and since those trees have golden fruits, they look as though decorated with goldenjewellery. Those golden-bodied tress are shining forth like tender sun and their pedestals arecompletely studded with lapis gems. The birds encircling those trees are in the hue of lapis lazuligems. The lotus lakes are encompassed with golden lotuses with broad petals, which in shine aresimilar to tender sun. [4-50-24b, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29a]"
4-50-23,"Then they beheld there the lotus-lakes containing serene waters and stocky lotusesand burly fishes that are golden. [4-50-29b, 30a]"
4-50-24,"There the monkeys beheld choicest mansions everywhere made out of gold and silver,some with golden and some with silver domes, while some with golden and some with silvermulti-stories, but all are studded with lapis gems with golden windows covered with laceworks ofpearls. [4-50-30b-32a]"
4-50-25,"They have also seen everywhere flowered and fruited trees that are similar in shineto red corals and rubies, and golden honeybees, as well as honeys. [4-50-32b, 33a]"
4-50-26,"They beheld everywhere diverse and capacious beds and seats that are amazinglycrafted with gemstones and gold, and also stacks of utensils made of gold, silver and bell metal.[4-50-33b, 34]"
4-50-27,"They saw the stockpiles of heavenly aloe vera substances and sandalwood sticks anddepurated eatables, tubers and fruits. [4-50-35]"
4-50-28,"They have also seen top-grade soft drinks, luscious honeys, heaps of finest qualityclothing, exotic blankets and sheaves of deerskins. [4-50-36, 37a]"
4-50-29,"Vanara-s have also observed mounds of undefiled gold stockpiled here and thereglowing with the glow of ritual fire. [4-50-37b, 38a]"
4-50-30,"When searching here and there in that cavity those valiant vanara-s of highresplendence have perceived some lady rather not far from them. [4-50-38b, 39a]"
4-50-31,"They saw a sainted lady there who is attired in jute-cloths and who is on acontrolled diet and who is like a luminiferous entity by her own luminescence of asceticism.[4-50-38b, 39a]"
4-50-32,"In wonderment the monkeys stood still all over, and in the matter of her identityHanuma asked her, ""Who are you? Whose cavity is this, either? [4-50-40b, 40c]"
4-50-33,"Then Hanuma whose shine is similar to that of a mountain making palm-fold andreverencing that aged lady asked, ""Who are you? Whose is this cavity, or the mansion or thesejewels? Please speak."" [4-50-41]"
4-51-1,"Thus, Hanuma on saying therein [that subject,] again spoke to that most reverentialand sainted lady who is dressed in black deerskin and conducting herself in probity. [4-51-1]"
4-51-2,"Overtired with hunger and thirst we are overawed anywise, and we suddenly enteredthis cavity, which is overspread with darkness... [Thus Hanuma is speaking to her.] [4-51-2]"
4-51-3,"We entered this extensive hollow of earth thirstily, but on seeing this kind ofthese diverse and marvellous mansions we are verily amazed [presuming that this is a dominion ofsome demon,] and we are agitated [in not knowing dos and don'ts,] and agonised [at ourincarceration...] whose trees are all these golden ones, splendent like young sun... [4-51-3,4]"
4-51-4,"The edibles, tubers, and fruits are all depurated... golden are the aircrafts...mansions silvern... ventilators golden and encased in jewelly laces... [4-51-5, 6a]"
4-51-5,"Flowered and fruited and also aromatically scented are these auspicious andcompletely golden trees... by whose splendour [they are rendered thus?] [4-51-6b, 7a]"
4-51-6,"Also how the lotuses born in limpid water are golden, and how the fishes along withtortoises are ostensibly golden? [4-51-7b, 8a]"
4-51-7,"Or, is all this owing to the innate prodigy of yours or to whose ascesis' prowessall this is owed... as all of us are oblivious of it, so it will be apt of you to narrate all ofit... [Thus Hanuma requested that sainted lady.] [4-51-8b, 9a]"
4-51-8,"Thus when Hanuma addressed her, that sainted lady, and a blissful one in the wellbeing of all the beings, she replied Hanuma. [4-51-9b, 10a]"
4-51-9,"A marvellous fantasist by name Maya was there, a bullish demon of wizardry and byhim with his phenomenal expertise all this golden woodland is constructed... [Thus, that saintedlady started her narration.] [4-51-10b]"
4-51-10,"Once he was the Universal Craftsman to the lords of demons by whom this divinelygolden and superb mansion was constructed... [4-51-11]"
4-51-11,"But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest,obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, [which entails acquirement of] entire wealth of SageShukra..."
4-51-12,"But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest,obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, [which entails acquirement of] entire wealth of thosepeople, who immoderately and avariciously beseech all the available gods, to accord all wealth tothem only...[4-51-12b, 13a]"
4-51-13,"That dynamic one methodised everything and then resided comfortably in this greatforest for some time, privileged with all his wishes... [4-51-13b, 14a]"
4-51-14,"Indra, the Administrator of Worlds and destroyer of enemy citadels, on taking HisThunderbolt eliminated Maya, when that eminent demon was engaged with an apsara, a paradisiacalnymph, called Hema... [4-51-14b, 15a]"
4-51-15,"This marvellous woodland, these everlasting wish-fulfillers, and this goldenmansion, are beneficed by Brahma for Hema... [4-51-15]"
4-51-16,"I am the daughter of Merusaavarni, oh, best monkey, named Swayamprabha and I amsafeguarding this mansion of her, [that apsara] Hema... [4-51-16b, 17a]"
4-51-17,"Hema is a virtuoso in dance and music and my dearest nymphean-friend, and shebestowed a boon upon me [by which none can dishonour me, and thus] I am safeguarding this superbmansion... [4-51-17b, 18a]"
4-51-18,"What is your effort or for what reason you came to pass this impervious forest, andhow you all have discovered this impassable forest... [4-51-18b, 19a]"
4-51-19,"Dine on these wholesome edibles, fruits and tubers, also on drinking soft drinks,it is apt of you to inform me all about [your mission... Thus Swayamprabha gave hospitality to themonkeys.] [4-51-19b, 19c]"
4-52-1,"When those monkey commanders are relaxed after refreshments, then that sainted lady, who concentrates single-mindedly and who is a pursuer of probity, spoke this word to all of them. [4-52-1]"
4-52-2,"Oh, vanara-s, if your enervation is eased off by devouring fruits, and if I may listen to that episode of yours, I wish to listen to it. Thus Swayamprabha addressed the monkeys. [4-52-2]"
4-52-3,"Hanuma, the son of Air-god, sincerely started to narrate their episode in its pithiness on hearing her words. [4-52-3]"
4-52-4,"The king of all the world and one similar to Mahendra and Rain-god, such an illustrious Rama of Dasharatha entered Dandaka forest with his bother Lakshmana, even along with his wife Vaidehi, but Ravana coercively abducted his wife from Janasthaana. [4-52-4, 5]"
4-52-5,"A valiant one and the king of important vanara-s known as Sugreeva is a vanara and the friend of that kingly Rama, and that vanara king expedited us. [4-52-6]"
4-52-6,"He mobilised us along with these important vanara-s and Angada as helmsman to this southerly prospect, which is the walkabout of Sage Agastya and watched over by Yama, the Death-god, saying, &#39;you all shall collectively search for Seetha of Videha kingdom together with the demon Ravana, a guise-changer by his wish.&#39; [4-52-7, 8]"
4-52-7,"On searching out the southerly direction in its entirety we are all hungered and we all gathered around at a tree-stem. [4-52-9]"
4-52-8,"All of us were whey-faced, all of us were preoccupied with propositions, thus deluged in the depthless deep of our despair we could not overreach the other shore of our oceanic despair. [4-52-10]"
4-52-9,"Then straggling our eyes we perceived this wide cavity wrapped up with vines and woods and enwrapped in darkling. [4-52-11]"
4-52-10,"Swans, water-hawks, saarasa-waterfowls were coming out of this cavity drenched in water and sprinkling drops of water with the flaps of their wings. [4-52-12]"
4-52-11,"I said to all of them, &#39;Good! Let us enter it,&#39; while they too had some inference about the availability of water in here. [4-52-13]"
4-52-12,"As our task was hastening us then we all readied ourselves to fall in the cavity by tightly clasping each other&#39;s hand, and then we fell in this cavity. [4-52-14]"
4-52-13,"Thus we readily entered this Black Cavity, and this much is our activity in here as we all have come here by our escapade for water, and we neared you when we were ravenous and retrogressing. [4-52-15, 16a]"
4-52-14,"And we who are overly harassed by hunger have devoured the fruits and tubers you have offered with the grace of your hospitality. [4-52-16]"
4-52-15,"You have rescued all of us who were on the verge of hunger-deaths, and what is to be done by vanara-s for you in requital that you may please tell. Thus Hanuma spoke to that sainted lady. [4-52-17b, 18a]"
4-52-16,"When she is spoken thus by those vanara-s then that omniscient Swayamprabha replied this to all of the vanara commanders. [4-52-18b, 19a]"
4-52-17,"I am very happy with all of the mighty vanara-s and what I have done to you is a part of my conduct in equity, hence nothing need be done now in my favour, in the least. [4-52-9b, 20a]"
4-52-18,"When Hanuma is said that blessed word by that sainted lady in that way, that which is agreeable to propriety, then Hanuma said this sentence to her who is with an unreprovable discernment. [4-52-20b, 21a]"
4-52-19,"We are now under the auspices of your ladyship comporting yourself in scrupulosity. We lapsed the time stipulated for us by the noble-souled Sugreeva by our roving around in this cavity. [4-52-21b, 22]"
4-52-20,"Such as you are, a righteous lady, it will be apt of you to cross us over this cavity, as we have overextended the timeframe fixed by Sugreeva, whereby our longevity itself is threatened. [4-52-23]"
4-52-21,"Oh, prudent lady, sail all of us through. We are rendered as hesitaters with the fear from Sugreeva. We still have to achieve an admirable achievement and that deed is also left undone as we are held-up in here. Thus Hanuma spoke to her. [4-52-24, 25a]"
4-52-22,"When Hanuma said thus that sainted lady said sentence, I believe outgoing is impracticable for the incomers in aliveness from this cavity. [4-52-25b, 26a]"
4-52-23,"By the sublime efficacy of ascesis acquired through my practices of numerous self-restraints I wish to sail all of the vanara-s through the incarceration, called this cavity. [4-52-26b, 27a]"
4-52-24,"All of you best vanara-s shall close up your eyelids, for it is indeed impossible to attempt an exit with unclose eyes. Thus that sainted lady said to monkeys. [4-52-27b, 28a]"
4-52-25,"Then all of those desirers of departure are gladdened and immediately shut their eyelids, and further they lidded them with their delicately fingered hands. [4-52-28b, 29a]"
4-52-26,"She then sailed those noble souled vanara-s who covered their faces with their hands through that cavity barely within a minute. [4-52-29b. 30a]"
4-52-27,"That virtuous and sainted lady on comforting all of the monkeys, who are taken out of that precarious cavity, spoke this to them at the exterior of cavity. [4-52-30b, 31a]"
4-52-28,"This one which is surrounded by diverse trees and vines is the magnificent Vindhya Mountain, this mountain is Prasravana, and this vast expanse of water is the southerly ocean. Now I wish to return to my mansion... oh, best vanara-s, let safety betide you. saying thus Swayamprabha the Sainted Lady, re-entered the ostentatious cavity, called Riksha Bila. [4-52-31b, 32]"
4-53-1,"Then they saw an inexorable ocean, the realm of Rain-god, tumultuous with out-roaring and implacable waves, and shoreless otherwhere. [4-53-1]"
4-53-2,"Which month is set as timeframe for the monkeys by king Sugreeva that month passed off while the monkeys are searching mountains, impassable areas and within the cavity concocted by the wizardry of demon Maya. [4-53-2]"
4-53-3,"Sitting on a foothill of Mt. Vindhya which is with fully flowered trees those virtue-souled monkeys are then driven in desperation. [4-53-3]"
4-53-4,"Then on seeing the treetops of spring season, weighty with flowers and enshrouded with hundreds of vines, they became incredulous with the fright of failing Sugreeva&#39;s timeframe. [4-53-4]"
4-53-5,"On discussing among themselves they found that spring season has arrived, and they also found the purpose of timely messaging about Seetha to Sugreeva is lost, thus they plumped down onto the surface of earth. [4-53-5]"
4-53-6,"The crown prince and a great foreseer Angada, the monkey, whose nape of neck is leonine and bullish, arms lengthy and sturdy, then as usual paying respects to elderly monkeys greeted all of the forest dwellers and spoke this sentence in a modest voice. [4-53-6, 7]"
4-53-7,"Oh, monkeys, we all have started at the command of the king of monkeys, and the month fixed by him is zeroed out while we were in Black Cavity. Are you aware of it? Thus Angada started to speak his mind. [4-53-8]"
4-53-8,"We were sent out scheduling time calculating from the month of <font color=""#B3003A"">aashviiyuja</font> nearly October. Even that time fixed for us has also lapsed. Thereby, what is to be done next? [4-53-9]"
4-53-9,"You all the pioneers in the pathway of principles, you have notched up the credibility of your king, you are all well-disposed in the well-being of your king, and you are the contrivers of any exploit. [4-53-10]"
4-53-10,"All of you are unparalleled in all tasks, all your asperity is renowned in all directions, and all of you have come impelled by that ochreish eyed Sugreeva keeping me as your helmsman. [4-53-11]"
4-53-11,"As of now our mission is incomplete hence we are scheduled to die, and there is no doubt about it. Who can be complacent by keeping the directive of monkey&#39;s king incomplete? [4-53-12]"
4-53-12,"But in this matter of course, as the time set by Sugreeva is lapsed, it is appropriate for all of us forest dwelling monkeys to voluntarily undertake fasting unto death. [4-53-13]"
4-53-13,"Instinctively Sugreeva is a tormentor and now he is institutionalised in lordship, thus he will not condone any of us as we will be as good as transgressors if we were to return. [4-53-14]"
4-53-14,"Sugreeva commits sin alone in our respect by killing all of us as we failed in the facts about Seetha, therefore it is pertinent to enter upon fasting unto, leaving off our sons, wives, riches and houses and homes, too. [4-53-15, 16a]"
4-53-15,"That king Sugreeva definitely and freakishly tortures all of us on our going back futilely, hence suicide at this place is justifiable for all us. [4-53-16b, c]"
4-53-16,"I am not anointed to crown-princedom by Sugreeva, but I am anointed by the unbigoted Rama, the king of people. [4-53-17b, 18a]"
4-53-17,"That king Sugreeva who is already bound up in animosity with my father, and thus with me too, now on observing me transgressing his directive will decisively wish to liquidate me by a tyrannous victimisation. [4-53-18a, 19a]"
4-53-18,"Of what use is the witnessing of my kith and kin at me when I am tortured in the prime of my life, hence here on this sacred seashore alone I will outwait my death fasting unto it. Thus Angada said to all the monkeys. [4-53-19b, c]"
4-53-19,"On hearing all that uttered by that youngish Angada, the crown prince, all of those prominent Vanara-s sympathetically spoke these words. [4-53-20]"
4-53-20,"Instinctively Sugreeva is a hot-tempered vanara and Raghava is interested in his beloved wife. The timeframe is lapsed and Vaidehi is unspotted. If we go back to Kishkindha now, on seeing us returning without completing our assignment, and with a thinking to satisfy Rama Sugreeva wishes to liquidate us without any doubt. [4-53-21, 22]"
4-53-21,"It will be inexcusable for the culprits to pass at the sideways of lords, then where is the question of their coming into king&#39;s audience, and we should be barefaced to return because we are all the chieftains of Sugreeva who are coordinated and sent here. [4-53-23]"
4-53-22,"If we do not return to that champion Sugreeva on searching somewhere here for Seetha, or on our educing some information about her, we will rather enter the realm of Yama, the Terminator. Thus the other monkeys discussed among themselves. [4-53-24]"
4-53-23,"On hearing the words of fly-jumpers, who are tormented by fear of Sugreeva, Lt. Tara spoke this to them, enough is your desperation, if you all are interested let us enter that cave again where we can live. [4-53-25]"
4-53-24,"That highly impassable cavity is contrived by the demon Maya and it is abundant with trees, water, eatables and potables, and there is no fear even from Indra in that cavity, nor from Raghava, nor from Sugreeva, the king of monkeys. So said Lt. Tara to all. [4-53-26]"
4-53-25,"On hearing Angada&#39;s words, as well as the words of Lt. Tara that are trended to Angada&#39;s words, all the monkeys compliantly spoke with believability, in which way we all will not be killed that way may be waymarked, and promptly make it happen now only. So said all the monkeys to Angada. [4-53-27]"
4-54-1,"When Lt Tara whose resplendence is similar to moonshine has spoken that way, then Hanuma deemed that Angada is laying siege to that kingdom of Vanaras. [4541]"
4-54-2,"Hanuma considered Vali&#39;s son Angada indeed as having eightfold intelligence, fourfold tactics, fourteen traits. [4542]"
4-54-3,"Angada who is steadily brimming over with his spiritedness, mightiness, valorousness, and waxing like the moon starting from day one of White Fortnight of a month, who is comparable to Brihaspati, the Jupiter, in sagacity, who mirrors up his father Vali in intrepidity, but who is now assiduously attentive to the rebellious teachings of Lt. Tara, like Indra who once listened to the unlistenable teachings of demon&#39;s mentor, namely Shukraacaarya, as that Angada is overly enervated to fulfil the concerns of the king Sugreeva. Then Hanuma who is the scholar in all scriptures started to confederate the confidence of Angada with the present regime of Sugreeva. [4543, 4, 5]"
4-54-4,"Hanuma then rhetorically started to the schismatic secession of all those vanaras, who are desirous of avoiding Sugreeva and desiring a hideout, exemplifying the third ideation, namely the partition, among the four political ideations, viz., placation, presentation, partition, persecution. [4546]"
4-54-5,"When Hanuma made all of the vanaras to defect from Angada&#39;s idea of defecting Sugreeva, then Hanuma further overawed Angada with diverse and awesome orations containing the fourth ideation, namely the persecutory measures, employable by Sugreeva on defectors. [4547]"
4-54-6,"As with your father you are undeniably abler in warfare, oh, the son of Lady Tara, and as with your father you are unquestionably capable enough to sustain the monkey kingdom. Thus Hanuma started to address Angada. [4548]"
4-54-7,"Oh, best monkey, Angada, monkeys will be inconsistent at their will, isn&#39;t it! Separated from their sons and wives they cannot tolerate to remain under your control for a long. [4549]"
4-54-8,"I plainly tell you what is obvious. This Jambavanta, these monkeys like Niila, and great monkey Suhotra and others do not definitely tagalong you, isn&#39;t it. Likewise I too do not definitely tagalong you. Such as we are, it will be impossible for you to sidetrack us from Sugreeva using tactics like placation, presentation or even persecution, isn&#39;t so! [45410, 11]"
4-54-9,"Even if a mightless is at odds with the mighty he can linger on, so to speak, therefore guard yourself, for no mediocrity will be at odds... [45412]"
4-54-10,"This matter of going underground into that Black Hole which you suppose as a hideout from Sugreeva, as you heard from Lt. Tara and others, but it is a deed of trifle to Lakshmana&#39;s arrows, not necessarily for Rama&#39;s arrows, in splitting apart whole of that Black Hole in a trice. [45413]"
4-54-11,"Indeed, once Indra thudded his Thunderbolt on this very underground illusory place, but that act was indeed a trivial deed for that Thunderbolt made a single demonsized aperture to eliminate a single demon, Maya, which we now call <font color=""#B3003A"">Riksha bila,</font> Black Hole, nevertheless Lakshmana will splinter whole of this Black Hole with his acute arrows, as if it is leafy bowl. [45414]"
4-54-12,"There are numerous ironarrows with Lakshmana that are kindred to Thunderbolt of Indra, whose punch will be equalling that of Thunderbolt and Lightning Flashes, and which are the splitters of mountains. [45415]"
4-54-13,"As and when you settle down in that underground, more so, an unbefitting place for a crown prince, oh, enemyburner Angada, then and there all the monkeys will desert you resolvedly. [45416]"
4-54-14,"Always sulking and reminiscing on their sons and wives, and hungered for the proximity of their kinfolk and hungered for diverse palatability as any monkey would cherish, even so, lamenting on the beds of lament they push you backwards. [45417]"
4-54-15,"Devoid of goodhearted friends and wellwishing relatives, you will become highly sullen in solitariness. Such as you are you will end up as a highly frightened monkey, even from the shaking of a piece of straw."
4-54-16,"Devoid of goodhearted friends and wellwishing relatives, you will become highly sullen in solitariness. Such as you are you will end up as a highly frightened monkey and you will end up much the same as a seamy shaky piece of straw. [45418]"
4-54-17,"By far, those fiercely frantic arrows of Lakshmana if targeted to kill you, in case you become a sidestepper from loyalties, will be terrifyingly twingeing. Further, those fierily frenetic arrows are irreversible. [45419]"
4-54-18,"But, if you return to Kishkindha along with us, and if you obediently become Sugreeva&#39;s flanker, he establishes you only in kingdom as before. [45420]"
4-54-19,"Your paternaluncle Sugreeva&#39;s gleam is his honesty as he is free of dishonesty, his desire is affection as he is free of aversion, his dedication is staunch as he is free of prevarication, and he himself is exoneration as he is free from exploitation, thus in no way he liquidates you. [45421]"
4-54-20,"He is your mother&#39;s wellwisher, the strife of Sugreeva&#39;s life is for her only, more so, there is no other posterity to him than you. Oh, Angada, therefore go back to Kishkindha, rather than deflecting, deviating and deserting your own kingdom. [45422]"
4-55-1,"On hearing the polite and righteous words of Hanuma, which are just yeomanly towards Hanuma&#39;s lord, namely Sugreeva, Angada said these sentences. [4-55-1]"
4-55-2,"Un-deducible in Sugreeva are his steadiness, or harmlessness, or frankness, also thus salience, or even valiance, further more cleanliness of heart or soul. [4-55-2]"
4-55-3,"Which Sugreeva has arrogated his elder brother&#39;s wife when that elder brother is still alive and well, where she is morally his motherlike, an empress and a lady love of that elder brother, thus he is despicable, and which Sugreeva closed the mouth of the cavity when his brother in all his belief assigned and stationed him alone at the mouth of the cavity to fightback the demon Dundubhi if he tries to escape, all the more when his own brother is still inside the cavity, thus he is nefarious, how then he can be said as one conversant with moral rectitude? [4-55-3, 4]"
4-55-4,"Which Sugreeva has overlooked no less than the great glorious Raghava, whom he truthfully befriended and from whom his own task of arrogating my kingdom by eliminating my father is facilitated, how then can he remember the good services of others like us? [4-55-5]"
4-55-5,"He has ordered and sent us for searching Seetha owing to the fear from Lakshmana, but not as a coward fearing his own unscrupulousness, how then can scrupulosity be manifest in him? [4-55-6]"
4-55-6,"Who is that respectable one who can put belief in Sugreeva, while that Sugreeva is shameful by his shameless act of eliminating my father, and unmindful of tradition in usurping my mother and throne, and unthankful in requiting Rama by himself, instead of using us as pawns, and changeful in ignoring his promise to Rama, but in fearing for Lakshmana? Will it be possible especially for one like me belonging to his family? [4-55-7]"
4-55-7,"Whether a son is honest or dishonest he alone is investable in the kingdom. How then can Sugreeva let me, the one from the family of his enemy, live on? [4-55-8]"
4-55-8,"My slyness in planning to live in Black Hole has backfired, I am now culpable in not finding Seetha being the troop leader, and I am a powerless as you all are Sugreeva&#39;s side, how then can I live on indeed after reaching Kishkindha, like caitiff turned into a wretch. [4-55-9]"
4-55-9,"Indeed he surceases me by some mysterious trammelling punishment, for that Sugreeva becomes disingenuous, ferocious, also barbarous just for the reason of his kingship. [4-55-10]"
4-55-10,"Fast unto death behoves me than trammels and tramples, thus you all be acquiescent to my proposal and you may go back to your dwellings. [4-55-11]"
4-55-11,"I am reiterating to you all that I do not wish to go to the city of Kishkindha, and here only I sit fasting unto death, as death alone is expedient to me. [4-55-12]"
4-55-12,"On my behalf Raghava-s wellbeing may be enquired firstly paying deference to them, so also the wellbeing of my paternal uncle and king may be enquired, only after paying deference to that lord of vanara-s. [4-55-13, 14a]"
4-55-13,"My step-mother Ruma may be asked after regarding her healthiness. And it will be apt of you to solace my mother Lady Tara, who by her nature is a warm-hearted and austerely lady who cherishes her son more, and such as she is she will obviously leave off her life on hearing that I breathed my last. So said Angada to all monkeys. [4-55-14b, 16a]"
4-55-14,"On speaking to that point and after paying deference to older vanara-s available there, Angada puling glum facedly reclined on the sacred grass spread on ground. [4-55-16b, 17a]"
4-55-15,"Apropos to Angada&#39;s recumbency on ground, the other outstanding Vanara-s snivellingly sluiced down seethingly effusive teardrops emotionally. [4-55-17b, 18a]"
4-55-16,"While disesteeming Sugreeva but esteeming Vali, all of the vanara-s have gathered around Angada deciding to sit down for fasting unto death in step with Angada. [4-55-18b, 19a]"
4-55-17,"Those best ones among fly-jumpers on discerning the words of Angada, the son of Vali, and agreeing to what all said by Angada as appropriate, they positioned themselves on the sacred grass after touching waters sacramentally. The sacred-grass is spread as sacred beds to cast off their lives. The edges of grass blades are positioned southward. As they are on that northern shore of southern ocean, all those best monkeys who are bent on to self-immolation, they became recumbent facing eastward. [4-55-19b, 21a]"
4-55-18,"An unknown apprehensive dread came upon those monkeys when they discussed Rama&#39;s living in forests, Dasharatha&#39;s demise, calamity caused to Janasthaana, casualty to Jataayu, like that the stealing of Vaidehi and slaying of Vali. [4-55-21, 22]"
4-55-19,"While those many fly-jumpers who mirror up great mountaintops by their physique are recumbent discussing stridently, the entrails of caves of mountain are rendered strident, and that mountain itself appeared like skyscape filled with strident clouds about to burst a good fortune. [4-55-23]"
4-56-1,"At which mountain's tableland those monkeys sat down for self-immolation, to thatarea the elder brother of Jataayu, a kingly eagle known as Sampaati by name, one renowned one forhis forcefulness and aggressiveness, and a celebrated and sempiternal sky-flying eagle has arrived.[4-56-1, 2]"
4-56-2,"On coming out of the cave of the great-mountain Vindhya, Sampaati is gladden atheart to see the monkeys sitting down there, and he spoke these words. [4-56-3]"
4-56-3,"Whether it is good or bad, fate indeed follows humans in this world procedurally,why because, this fated and long-waited food has now come nigh of me... [4-56-4]"
4-56-4,"I wish to eat them frugally, killing one by one and eating one by one, preying onone on one day, and then preying upon the other on the other day... thus that bird spoke thosewords on seeing the massy fly-jumpers. [4-56-5]"
4-56-5,"On hearing the words of that gormandising bird, Angada became highly breathless andthen spoke to Hanuma. [4-56-6]"
4-56-6,"Look! In the name of an eagle, the son of the Sun, Yama, the Terminator, hasmanifestly arrived at this area for the fatality of monkeys... thus ill luck is still hauntingus... [4-56-7]"
4-56-7,"We fulfilled neither Rama's task, nor the decree of our king, but this unknowncatastrophe has abruptly bechanced for the monkeys... [4-56-8]"
4-56-8,"You all have heard in its entirety what deed the kingly Jataayu has done wishing todo good to Vaidehi... [4-56-9]"
4-56-9,"Like that all beings, even those birthed in animality, are doing what that isagreeable to Rama even on forgoing their own lives, as with us... [4-56-10]"
4-56-10,"Even animals will be mutually succouring by their instinct of concern andcamaraderie, therefore, let each of us leave off our souls, soulfully... [4-56-11]"
4-56-11,"Conscientious Jataayu has done a deed much liked by Rama, and we too have beentrekking the forests without caring even for our lives in the cause of Rama, but we have not seenMaithili... [4-56-12, 13a]"
4-56-12,"He that kingly eagle Jataayu who is killed by Ravana is a happy soul, and he iseven relieved from the fear of Sugreeva as he departed on the Avenue of Sublimity... [4-56-13b,c]"
4-56-13,"By the ending of Jataayu and by the end of Dasharatha, also by the purloin ofVaidehi, all of the monkeys are piled into a predicament... [4-56-14]"
4-56-14,"Just by giving boons to Kaikeyi, the quandaries like Rama's dwelling in forestsalong with Seetha and Lakshmana, as a result Rama's fury eliminating complete demons ofJanasthaana, and as a result Raghava's arrow exterminating Val, have come to pass. Thus Angada islamenting. [4-56-15,16]"
4-56-15,"On observing the monkeys who lay recumbent on ground and on hearing them eulogisingthe death of Jataayu he that king of eagles Sampaati is highly perturbed at that uncomfortableinformation about Jatayu, and that high minded Sampaati sorrowfully spelled out this word.[4-56-17]"
4-56-16,"That shredder-billed eagle Sampaati said this sentence voicing thunderously onhearing words voiced by Angada. [4-56-18]"
4-56-17,"Who speaks to announce as though to quake my heart that Jatayu, the more preciousbrother of mine than my own lives, is slain? [4-56-19]"
4-56-18,"How a combat occasioned between that eagle and a demon in Janasthaana, and how am Ihearing this name of my brother after a long time... [4-56-20]"
4-56-19,"I wish you to get me down from these mountain soars. After a long time I have heardabout my younger brother who is straightforward, praiseworthy for his valour, and I am glad thattoo spoke of him praisefully... [4-56-21, 22a]"
4-56-20,"Thereby, oh, best vanara-s, I wish to listen about the death of my brother Jataayuwhen he was in Janasthaana... [4-56-22b, 23a]"
4-56-21,"Whose eldest and dear son is Rama, the creditable one for doyens, that Dasharathais the friend of my brother Jatayu/ But how did Dasharatha pass away? [4-56-23b, 24a]"
4-56-22,"I am incapable to spread my wings widely as they are burnt by Sun's rays, hence oh,enemy-chasteners, I wish you to lower me down from this mountain... Thus Sampaati sought for thehelp of monkeys. [4-56-24b, c]"
4-57-1,"Though Sampaati's voice is turned husky by his sadness for the demise of his brotherJataayu, the monkey commanders doubtingly disbelieved neither him nor even his words by the fact ofhis being an eagle intending to kill and eat up all the monkeys. [4-57-1]"
4-57-2,"On seeing the eagle those fly-jumpers who sat for fast-unto-death have becomefurious at the eagle thinking that, ""that eagle wishes to eat up all of us..."" Thus, the monkeysdeliberated the eagle's words. [4-57-2]"
4-57-3,"We are sitting for fast-unto-death and if that eagle wishes eat us let it be so...then our deliverance will be achieved in anyway and we will go to heaven from here... Thus, someother monkeys gave thought to lower that eagle down. [4-57-3]"
4-57-4,"When all of the monkey chiefs made up their mind in this way, then some of them ongoing to the mountaintop brought that eagle down, and then Angada spoke to the eagle. [4-57-4]"
4-57-5,"Oh, bird, my noble grandfather is known as Rikshaja who was a valorous and anoutstanding monkey among all monkeys, was the king of monkeys. He has two generous and great mightysons namely Vali and Sugreeva. My father Vali was highly renowned in the world for his bold acts,and he became the king later to my grandfather... [4-57-5, 6]"
4-57-6,"Among Ikshvaku-s there is a great-charioteer, a king for the entire world, apeerless person, and he is the son of Dasharatha, namely Rama, and abiding by his father'sdirectives and opting for righteous course of conduct, he moved into Dandaka forests along with hisbrother Lakshmana and even with his wife Vaidehi... [4-57-7, 8]"
4-57-7,"Ravana forcibly abducted his wife from Janasthaana, namely Seetha, the princessfrom Videha kingdom, and a kingly eagle named Jataayu, who is a friend of Rama's father Dasharatha,has seen her while she was being abducted by skyway. [4-57-9, 10a]"
4-57-8,"Jatayu is overly tired when he made Ravana's chariot defective and withheldMaithili from abduction as he is senescent, then Ravana killed him in that conflict... [4-57-10b,c]"
4-57-9,"Thus that eagle was killed by that mighty Ravana, but solemnised by the obsequiesperformed by Rama, he departed on a sublime avenue to heavens... [4-57-11]"
4-57-10,"Then Raghava made friendship with my paternal uncle Sugreeva, an intellectualautocrat, and Sugreeva got my father killed. Since Sugreeva antagonised my father, my fatherinterdicted him along with his ministers, and Rama killed my father Vali and anointed Sugreeva...[4-57-12, 13]"
4-57-11,"Rama enthroned Sugreeva as the ruler of all vanara-s and that king of all vanarachiefs expedited all of us... [4-57-14]"
4-57-12,"Though we are spearheaded by Rama and though we searched thereabouts for Vaidehi atthe behest of Sugreeva, as with a nightly sunshine Vaidehi is unattainable for us... [4-57-15]"
4-57-13,"Such as we were we searched Dandaka forest very meticulously, but we unwittinglyentered into a wide-opened Black Hole of the earth... [4-57-16]"
4-57-14,"During our search in that Black Hole, which was crafted by the wizardry of demonMaya, the month fixed by our king for our return has been elapsed... [4-57-17]"
4-57-15,"We who are all supposed to execute the order of our king, we have exceeded theestablished norm of timeframe, and for fear of fury from our king Sugreeva we sat down forfast-unto-death... [4-57-18]"
4-57-16,"When Rama along with Lakshmana, and even Sugreeva will be infuriated by ourinfringement of time, and even on our going to Kishkindha, as infringers there will be no survivalfor all of us... Thus Angada narrated their plight to Sampaati. [4-57-19]"
4-58-1,"When those monkeys whose lives are almost purged spoke to Sampaati with such drearywords, that thunder-voiced eagle tearfully spoke to those vanara-s. [4-58-1]"
4-58-2,"Oh, vanara-s, of whom it is enounced that mighty Ravana felled him in a combat,that one is my younger brother named Jatayu... [4-58-2]"
4-58-3,"Even though I hear that my brother is slain I have to resign myself from anyactivity owing to my oldness and my winglessness, and presently I am indeed incapacitated toretaliate my brother's enemy... [4-58-3]"
4-58-4,"Once, when the elimination of demon Vritta was taking place at the hand of Indra,we two eagle-brothers sportively desiring to surpass each other flew sunward, and we have gone verynear to the scorch-rayed sun... [4-58-4]"
4-58-5,"Covering the skyway we have gone to firmament much speedily, then bechanced isnoontide and thus bechanced is the scorching of the noontime sun, and then Jataayu started tofounder... [4-58-5]"
4-58-6,"On seeing him who is being thwarted by scorching sunrays, then I started to covermy highly fretful brother with both of my wings in all my brotherliness... [4-58-6]"
4-58-7,"And oh, vanara-chiefs, when sunrays have utterly burned my wings I fell down onthis Mt. Vindhya, and while living hereabouts constrainedly, I could pay no attention to mybrother's experiences or, at least his existence, or otherwise... So lamented old Sampaati.[4-58-7]"
4-58-8,"When Sampaati the brother of Jataayu spoke in that way, then the highly discerningcrown prince Angada replied him. [4-58-8]"
4-58-9,"If you are the brother of Jataayu, if you have heard whatever I have said in praiseof Jataayu, and if you are aware of the whereabouts of Ravana... please tell it... [4-58-9]"
4-58-10,"If you are aware of the location of that bigoted and knavish demon Ravana, pleaseinform us. Doesn't matter whether that location is nearby or far off as we can search far andwide... Thus Angada asked Sampaati. [4-58-10]"
4-58-11,"Then Sampaati, the high-spirited elder brother of Jataayu, spoke these words thatare self-befitting and that would highly gladden the monkeys. [4-58-11]"
4-58-12,"I am an eagle with utterly burnt wings and vanished valiance, even then, I wish torender a best service in the task of Rama, at least verbally... [4-58-12]"
4-58-13,"I have seen the netherworlds of Rain-god viz., earth and its substrata like<font color=#B3003A"">atala. vitala, sutala, paataala</font> terrains... and I have even seen thoseempyrean worlds that were triply trodden by Vishnu, and the intermediary regions of upper and lowerworlds where gods and demons combated ghastlily, and because I am that aged I have also seen theunseeable Milky Ocean when it was churned for ambrosia... [4-58-13]"
4-58-14,"It is I who am to render service in this task of Rama firstly, than you vanara-s,as the common enemy of Rama and Jataayu is my first enemy, but I am decrepit as oldness has marredmy vigour and vitality... [4-58-14]"
4-58-15,"I have seen a youngish lady while she is being stolen away by the black-hearteddemon Ravana. She richly in her mien, embellished with every befitting jewellery for a princess,and that lady in fury was bewailing calling, 'Rama... Rama...' even calling 'Lakshmana...' and shewas throwing her ornaments down and her limbs were highly wriggly to set herself free from thatdemon... [4-58-15, 16]"
4-58-16,"In the flank of that blackish demon her best ochry silk-sari was dazzling likesunshine atop a blackish mountain, or like lighting athwart a blackish ocean... [4-58-17]"
4-58-17,"Thus, I deem her to be Seetha by her excessive laudation of Rama, and let thelocation of that demon be heard from me while I say about it... [4-58-18]"
4-58-18,"Literally, he is the son of Vishravasa and brother of Kubera, and he presides overthe city named Lanka and he is known as Ravana... [4-58-19]"
4-58-19,"There is a lavish city in the oceanic island afar a hundred yojana-s all in allfrom here, which Vishvakarma, the Divine-Architect, has built, and it is called Lanka.[4-58-20]"
4-58-20,"Its multi-storied buildings are built very symmetrically and they will be in goldentinge with completely golden doors. The golden podia of verandas are amazing. That city is securelyenclosed in a gigantic rampart that will be dazzling in the colour of sun... [4-58-21, 22a]"
4-58-21,"Therein that Lanka pitiable Vaidehi wearing ochry silk sari is lodged in thepalace-chambers of Ravana, highly sentineled and baulked by demonesses, and you can find kingJanaka's daughter Maithili in there... [4-58-22b, 23]"
4-58-22,"Now, oh, fly-jumpers, first get to the other shore of the island in southern ocean,which ocean spans in an overalled width of hundred yojana-s from this side of seashore, thenlanding on the other seashore you can see Lanka secluded all around by ocean, and in such awater-walled Lanka you can see Ravana... hence, hurry up, and promptly triumph over Lanka...[4-58-24, 25]"
4-58-23,"I foresee by my prognosis that your sighting Seetha is definite at that place, anddefinite is your return from there. The first flight level of birds is that of the small Kulingabirds, house sparrows, songbirds and the like subsisting on food-grains. The second flight level isthat of the birds that are the eaters of leftovers like crows and doves, or the eaters oftree-fruits like parrots. The third flight level is that of the wading birds like Bhaasa, Kraunca,Kurara birds and cranes, herons and the like. The fourth flight level is that of hawks and thefifth is that of the vultures. [4-58-26, 27, 28a]"
4-58-24,"And the sixth flight level is that of the swans which derive their valour, vigour,handsomeness and youthfulness by their majestic birth. But the uppermost path is that of the sonsof Lady Vinata, namely the Divine Eagle Garuda, and Anuuru, the non-stopping charioteer of Sun.Because we eagles have our lineal descent from the Divine Eagle, we can soar to the uppermostflyable path and see keenly... [4-58-28b, 29]"
4-58-25,"By which raw-flesh-eating demon this deplorable deed of abducting Seetha is done,if that demon is retaliated by Rama and you all, my vendetta towards the very same demon, caused byhis animosity towards my brother Jataayu will also be fulfilled... [4-58-30]"
4-58-26,"Staying here I am clearly seeing Ravana and like that Janaki... even for us eagles,our sight and power will be excellent like that of Garuda, the Divine Eagle... [4-58-31]"
4-58-27,"Thereby, oh, vanara-s, dietetically and congenitally we eagles can always see tillthe end of hundred yojana-s, comprehensively... [4-58-32]"
4-58-28,"The leg-fighters, namely cocks, are destined to have their livelihood just at thebase of their feet, but our livelihood is to be obtained from the farthest... alas... [4-58-33]"
4-58-29,"Let some idea be searched to leap the salty ocean. For sure, you will return toKishkindha on your finding Vaidehi, and on your becoming productive of you objective...[4-58-34]"
4-58-30,"I wish you would shift me to the residence of Rain-god, namely the ocean, foroblating water in respect of my great-souled brother Jataayu who departed to heaven... ThusSampaati spoke to the monkeys. [4-58-35]"
4-58-31,"Then those vanara-s of utmost dynamism on taking wing-burnt-bird Sampaati to thehusband rivulets and rivers, namely the ocean, placed him on the shoreline. Again, the vanara-ssincerely brought back that king of birds, Sampaati, after his offering oblations to Jataayu, andlodged him as a returnee at his own place. On deriving indication form Sampaati regarding Seetha,Ravana and Lanka, those returnless vanara-s returned to their search while their gladness returningto them. [4-58-36, 37]"
4-59-1,"A word about this and next four chapters. These chapters from 59 to 63 do not findplace in various other mms, besides having some contradictory statements in their verses. Hence,these are said to be interpolated chapters. However, if it is questioned as to why they are stillbeing incorporated in translations, in spite of the irregularities noticed, for this the reply is'because most ancient commentators have given elaborate commentaries on them they are stetted...'and thus these chapters are held valid."
4-59-2,"On hearing the words of that kingly eagle Sampaati that are relishable likeambrosia, then those best fly-jumpers are gladdened and rejoiced. [4-59-1]"
4-59-3,"Then the best fly-jumper Jambavanta got up along with all of the fly-jumpers fromthe surface of earth on which they sat for self-immolation, and spoke to kingly eagle Sampaati.[4-59-2]"
4-59-4,"You please tell vividly as to where is Seetha, who has actually seen her, who hasabducted Maithili, and thus you help all these forest-dwellers. [4-59-3]"
4-59-5,"Who is inadvertent of the onslaught of Rama's arrows, or of those that arepersonally bolted by Lakshmana, which arrows will be falling with the speed of thunderbolts? Thus,Jambavanta and others asked Sampaati. [4-59-4]"
4-59-6,"Sampaati is gladdened at the monkeys who refrained from self-immolation, and hegladly said this sentence to them so as to cheer them up who are now contemplating to listen aboutSeetha. [4-59-5]"
4-59-7,"I will now narrate as to how I have listened about the abduction of Vaidehi, bywhom it is said to me, and where that wide-eyed Seetha is... [4-59-6]"
4-59-8,"At one time I fell down on this impassable mountain which is breadth-wise in manyyojana-s, whereupon my age has advanced and my liveliness and forcefulness have slackened...[4-59-7]"
4-59-9,"My son who is the best one among all birds, and who is named as Supaarshva by hisname is sustaining me who am deteriorated to dire straits, with timely sustenance... [4-59-8]"
4-59-10,"Passion is exigent to the celestial-artists gandharva-s, aggression is exigent tosnakes, fear is exigent to deer, like that hunger is exigent to us, the eagles... [4-59-9]"
4-59-11,"On some day when hunger was aching me and I was aching for food, my son Supaarshvaturned up without flesh when the sun of the day went down... [4-59-10]"
4-59-12,"I reproved him as I was deprived of food, and my son who is an enhancer of mygladness pacified me and said this sentence about what has actually happened ... [4-59-11]"
4-59-13," 'Oh, father, I as a desirer of flesh flew up to skies in time and overspreadingthe Mt. Mahendra, I very well hovered on it... [4-59-12]"
4-59-14," 'I have been hovering there looking downward to completely impede the pathway ofthousands of underwater beings of the ocean on my own... [4-59-13]"
4-59-15," 'There I have seen someone who in simile is like a shoved heap of mascara and heis going away captivating a lady who equals the aurora in her shine. [4-59-14]"
4-59-16," 'On seeing two of them I resolved to use them up for the purpose of food, but hebenignly, basely and beggarly besought way-leave for their traversal... [4-59-15]"
4-59-17," 'There will be none assaulting those that entreat in a beggarly manner, evensomeone among basely people, isn't it! Then what else is to be said of my kind, aha! [4-59-16]"
4-59-18," 'He hastily went away as though enshrouding the skies with his vigour, and thenthe beings that move in the firmament have approached and applauded me... [4-59-17]"
4-59-19," 'The great-sages who approached me in firmament have said to me, 'fortunatelySeetha is alive, somehow he that Ravana has gone away with Seetha who in fact is to be protected byone and all like you, anyhow your are blest without a doubt... [4-59-18]"
4-59-20," 'Then those siddha-s, the celestial sages, have informed me on showing her whoseornaments and ochry-silk-sari are disorderly, and who is vanquished by the speediness of heranguish, and who is yelling both the names of Rama and Lakshmana, as the wife of Dasharatha's Rama,the daughter of Janaka. They have also informed on showing him who is abducting her as Ravana, theking of demons. [4-59-19, 20, 21a]"
4-59-21," 'And hence, oh, father, the lapse of time in my returning home...' thus that bestsentence maker Supaarshva informed me all the drift in its entirety... Thus Sampaati is continuinghis narration to monkeys. [4-59- 21b, 22a]"
4-59-22,"Even on listening that it has not come to my mind to dare Ravana. How a winglessbird can initiate any action, indeed! [4-59-22b, 23a]"
4-59-23,"But that which is possible for me to do is advising as a votary with the qualitiesof thinking and advising. Let it be heard as I narrate and in that matter of translating myinformation into action it certainly depends on your bravery. [4-59-23b, 24a]"
4-59-24,"Indeed with my analysis and information to you I wish to make all of you exuberantas I deem that I have done my bit, because whatever task of Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is therethat task is mine too. There is no doubt bout it. [4-59-24b, 25a]"
4-59-25,"Thereby, I reckon you as the best ones by your aptitude, fortitude and attitude,and as invincible ones even for gods, hence Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, shepherded you...[4-59-25, 26a]"
4-59-26,"What is more, the excruciating eagle-feathered arrows of Rama and Lakshmana areenough to give defence or offence to all the three worlds. [4-59-26b, 27a]"
4-59-27,"Perchance that Decahedral demon is definitely a powerful and prideful demon. But,as capable vanara-s there is nothing impossible to you, even in the least. [4-59-27]"
4-59-28,"Thereby, enough is the time-lapse and make a mental determination. Adventurers andprudent souls of your kind with not backslide in tasks, isn't it! [4-59-28]"
4-60-1,"Then the monkey commanders sat on that beautiful mountain surrounding the eagle fromall over, after that eagle has offered water-oblations for his deceased Jataayu and bathed forpurification. [4-60-1]"
4-60-2,"Sampaati who earned trustworthiness of monkeys, and who is sitting surrounded by allmonkeys, again gladly spoke to Angada who sat at his close by. [4-60-2]"
4-60-3,"Oh, monkeys, you all be quiet and listen to my words alertly as I wish to recountthe actuality as to how I came to know about Maithili... [4-60-3]"
4-60-4,"Oh, impeccable Angada, once I have fallen on the peak of this Mt. Vindhya whensunrays completely burned my wings and limbs scorching in sun's heat... [4-60-4]"
4-60-5,"On getting sensitivity after six days, and on looking in all directions I could notrecognise anything in the least, as I was helpless and frantic... [4-60-5]"
4-60-6,"But then on observing all the oceans, mountains, rivers, lakes, provinces andforests, I could regain senses... [4-60-6]"
4-60-7,"Since this mountain is teeming with teams of birds, caves in its midriffs, and itis with peaks of its own kind, thus I resolved this to be Mt. Vindhya at the coast of southernocean... [4-60-7]"
4-60-8,"There was a sacred hermitage belonging to a sage of intense ascesis known as SageNishaakara which was reverenced even by gods. [4-60-8]"
4-60-9,"Eight thousand years have lapsed while I was living here on this mountain after thedeparture of that probity knowing sage Nishakara to heaven. [4-60-9]"
4-60-10,"'I again reached the earth descending from the lopsided peak of Mt. Vindhya,onerously and slowly, whereat the sacred-grass-blades are thorny... [4-60-10]"
4-60-11,"As I was desiring to see that sage I neared that place with much anguish, because Iand Jataayu approached that sage for many a time in earlier times... [4-60-11]"
4-60-12,"Near about his hermitage wind wiffles with a sweet-smell, and no tree is flowerlessand no tree is fruitless, whatsoever it is... [4-60-12]"
4-60-13,"On nearing that sacred hermitage and sheltering myself at the base of a tree, Iwaited there desirous to see that godly Nishaakara... [4-60-13]"
4-60-14,"Then I saw the sage available distantly, returning facing north after performinghis holy bath, an unassailable sage irradiating the ambience with his radiance... [4-60-14]"
4-60-15,"Bears, antelopes, tigers, lions, and diverse reptiles and snakes are following himat his heel, as with living beings following a donor, or all-donating Brahma... [4-60-15]"
4-60-16,"As to how the ministerial and military staff retrace steps when a king enters hisplace-chambers, so also the animals and other beings on knowing the sage's entry into hishermitage, retraced their steps and went away... [4-60-16]"
4-60-17,"But the sage is gladdened on seeing me and though he has entered into his hermitagehe again came out in a moment and asked about the objective of my visit... [4-60-17]"
4-60-18," 'On seeing the deformity of your feathers, oh, gentle Sampaati, youunidentifiable. These two wings of yours are fire burnt, but lives are let out in your body...'Thus, the sage started to talk to me... [4-60-18]"
4-60-19," 'I have earlier seen you two eagle brothers, kingly eagles among eagles, similarin your speed to Wind-god and form-changers by your wish... [4-60-19]"
4-60-20," 'You are the elder, isn't it! And Jataayu is your younger brother. You used totouch my feet taking up human forms... [4-60-20]"
4-60-21,"Is this falling of wings a result of any illness, if so what is it... or is thisany scourge imposed on you, if so, who is he... tell me all who am inquiring into those details...[4-60-21]"
4-61-1,"Then I have informed the Sage Nishaakara all about that impossible andimpracticable deed done indiscreetly by me and Jataayu and our following the Sun in red heat, aswell... Thus Sampaati continued his legend. [4-61-1]"
4-61-2,"Oh, godly sage, scorching sun has ulcerated me, shame perturbed my senses for notprotecting Jatayu, further I am haggard to descend this mountain to come to you, such I am I amincapable to speak on, elaborately... [4-61-2]"
4-61-3,"Fascinated by our arrogance and inquisitive of our relative triumphs, myself andJataayu competitively flew up far-away on the sky... [4-61-3]"
4-61-4,"Before the sages on the peak of Mt. Kailash we have staked a stake that we twoshall follow the Sun till he reaches the great westerly mountain, namely Mt. Dusk... [4-61-4]"
4-61-5,"We reached the sky in a trice to a height wherefrom we could see each of thetownships on the surface of earth, separately and singly, in the size of a chariot's wheel...[4-61-5]"
4-61-6,"We have seen and heard instrumental music somewhere, and somewhere else tinkling ofjewellery, and elsewhere singing of many ladies dressed in red... [4-61-6]"
4-61-7,"On our quick rising to the sky and abiding in solar path we have observed that aforest is positioned just as a patch of pasture on earth... [4-61-7]"
4-61-8,"From there the earth covered with pebble like mountain heights appeared shingly,and interwoven with yarn like rivers the surface of the earth is thready... [4-61-8]"
4-61-9,"Himalayas, even Mt. Vindhya, and even the very high mountain Mt. Meru, shone forthlike elephants in lakes... [4-61-9]"
4-61-10,"Then there bechanced an abnormal sweating, tiredness and fear, and then stuporinvading both of us, we two underwent a severe vertigo... [4-61-10]"
4-61-11,"We are not in the know of southern direction which belongs to Yama, the Terminator,nor of south-east which belongs to Fire-god, also not of west which belongs to Rain-god... and theworld appeared as though burnt down by the fire at the end of era and destructed of its routine...[4-61-11]"
4-61-12,"Though my brainpower is deranged I again tried laboriously just depending on mysight. I again tried strenuously concentrating my brainpower and sight on Sun and I have directlyseen the Sun. Then the Sun appeared in a size equal to the earth. [4-61-12, 13]"
4-61-13,"Without informing me Jataayu started to trip over the earth, and then on seeing himI too let myself loose from the sky... [4-61-14]"
4-61-14,"I have hidden Jataayu in sky with both my wings from the scorching Sun... hence, heis not burn that much... but I am completely burnt when falling from the sky... [4-61-15]"
4-61-15,"I supposed that Jataayu as has fallen in Janasthaana, but I have fallen on Mt.Vindhya, as a wing-burnt and insensate eagle... [4-61-16]"
4-61-16,"As one who is divested of his kingdom, his brother, both of his wings, and his ownvalance too, such as I was I wished to fall from the mountaintop to die, in any way...[4-61-17]"
4-62-1,"On informing the sage in this way I wept as I was highly despaired. Then onmeditating for a while that sage said this... Thus Sampaati continued his narration, and now hereports to Angada and others what that is said by Sage Nishaakara to him. [4-62-1]"
4-62-2," 'Again both of your wings will emerge as small wings anew, also thus your valour,power, and life-force will comeback...' Thus Sage Nishaakara started to console Sampaati.[4-62-2]"
4-62-3," 'In olden days I have heard that a very great happening is going to happen indeed,and it is known to me as I perceived it ascetically... [4-62-3]"
4-62-4,"There is some king known as Dasharatha, an enhancer of Ikshvaku dynasty, and to himthere will be a great-resplendent a son who will be known as Rama... [4-62-4]"
4-62-5," 'When his father assigns him for that objective of his going to forests, thattruth-valiant Rama goes to forests along with his brother Lakshmana... [4-62-5]"
4-62-6," 'A demon named Ravana, the chief of demons, and an unkillable one even for gods ordemons abducts Rama's wife from Janasthaana... [4-62-6]"
4-62-7," 'She that Maithili, a highly privileged and prestigious lady does not touch anyfood, though she is highly lured by banquets and feasts by that Ravana, for she will be sunken insorrow... [4-62-7]"
4-62-8," 'On knowing Seetha's plight Indra gives a nectarean food for Vaidehi, which foodis renowned to be Nectarous and unattainable even by gods... [4-62-8]"
4-62-9," 'But on getting that food, and on knowing that it is from Indra, Maithili takes upthe first morsel and dispenses it on the surface of earth for Rama, saying... [4-62-9]"
4-62-10," 'If my husband is living, or even my younger brother-in-law Lakshmana is living,or even if they have attained godhood, this food belongs to both of them...' Saying so Seethaoffers oblation to them... [4-62-10"
4-62-11," 'Ushered by Rama, oh, sky-flyer Sampaati, fly-jumpers will be going over to theplace where Seetha is captivated as harbingers of Rama, and you ought to tell those monkeys aboutthe queen of Rama... [4-62-11]"
4-62-12," 'In any case you ought not to go-as-you-please... a wingless eagle of your kindwhere you wish to go... await the times and scenes, you will regain both of your wings...[4-62-12]"
4-62-13," 'I am capable of making you a winged eagle now itself, but how can you stay hereand do an agreeable deed to the worlds! So you have to wait. [4-62-13]"
4-62-14," 'That deed aimed at the wellbeing of both those princes, Rama and Lakshmana, andof Brahmans, teaches, sages and also of Indra is to be done by you alone, isn't it! [4-62-14]"
4-62-15," 'Even I wish to see those brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, but I do not wish to bearlives prolongedly, hence I castaway my mortal body...' and thus that is what the great sageNishakara said to me. Saying so that sage, who is a discerner who discerned the sum and substanceof Supreme Person castaway his mortal body in his ascent to heaven. Sampaati continued hisnarration in this way. [4-62-15]"
4-63-1,"That expert in sentences, namely sage Nishaakara, entered his own dwelling onsaying these and many other words of encouragement and after permitting me to take leave.[4-63-1]"
4-63-2,"But on creeping slowly and slowly from the cave of that mountain I clambered up theMt. Vindhya and I am looking forward for your arrival... [4-63-2]"
4-63-3,"As of now, a little more than a hundred years have slipped by, and I am awaitingevents and times minding sage's words in my heart... [4-63-3]"
4-63-4,"But many illogical thoughts crowded round me when Sage Nishaakara has gone on greatvoyage to heaven, thus my anguish burned me down... [4-63-4]"
4-63-5,"I have been reversing the thought cropped up for my suicide by virtue of theafflatus endowed to me by that sage, and I have been safeguarding my lives as that afflatus istaking away my anguish, as a tongue of flaring fire takes away darkness... [4-63-5, 6a]"
4-63-6,"Though I am aware of the valour of that dirty-minded Ravana, I was rebuking my sonsaying, 'how you have not saved Maithili?' [4-63-6b, 7a]"
4-63-7,"My son has not effectuated my cherish even on hearing the bewail of Seetha, or atleast on hearing that Rama and Lakshmana are separated from Seetha, or at least on knowing myfriendship with Dasharatha... Thus Sampaati spoke to monkeys. [4-63-7b, 8a]"
4-63-8,"Both the wings of Sampaati have then cropped up just before the eyes of thosemonkeys who are clustering around him, while Sampaati is speaking in this way to those monkeys...[4-63-8b, 9a]"
4-63-9,"On looking at his own body which is now covered with newborn reddish-feathered wingsSampaati obtained an incomparable rejoice, and he also said this to vanara-s. [4-63-9b, 10a]"
4-63-10,"By the efficacy of that kingly sage of illimitable magnificence both the wings ofSampaati that were burnt down by sunrays have resurfaced again. [4-63-10b, 11a]"
4-63-11,"Which valour, vigour, and valiance were prevailing in my youth, now I amexperiencing them alone... [4-63-11b, 12a]"
4-63-12,"Let an endeavour be made by all of you. For sure, you will come by Seetha. Thisevent of my regaining wings shall be the causer of credibility in you all... [4-63-12b, 13a]"
4-63-13,"On saying thus to all of those monkeys that best bird Sampaati took wing from thatmountaintop to ascertain the plight of a sky-going bird when anew on the wing. [4-63-13b, 14a]"
4-63-14,"On hearing that word of Sampaati those tigerly monkeys are heartily gladdened andwhile their valour inspiriting them they have became proactive towards their task. [4-63-14]"
4-63-15,"Those best fly-jumpers having redeemed their certitude, then with a gustily gustowaited for an opportune time called <font color=""#B3003A"">abhijit lagna</font> and then journeyedon to the southern direction, as they are the pioneers in searching Seetha, the daughter of Janaka.[4-63-15]"
4-64-1,"Those lion-hearted fly-jumpers who are informed thus by the kingly eagle Sampaati have gladly jumped and loped and screamed in league [4-64-1]"
4-64-2,"On hearing the words of Sampaati, the monkeys have delightedly come to the ocean to go to the residence of Ravana, longing for a glimpse of Seetha. [4-64-2]"
4-64-3,"Passing across that province those superbly venturesome monkeys have seen the ocean available there, appearing like a great mirror image of the world in it entirety. [4-64-3]"
4-64-4,"On reaching the northern side of southern ocean those best monkeys have collectively made a camp there. [4-64-4]"
4-64-5,"That ocean is uproarious with its tides, and with its gigantic and misshapen beings that are sporting in water with their wide-opened mouths."
4-64-6,"Somewhere that ocean is as though sleeping well, and somewhere else it is as though sporting, elsewhere it is overspread with tidewaters as high as mountains, somewhere else it is tumultuous with the best demonic beings who are the residents on the plane of netherworld, and the elephantine monkeys despaired on seeing such a hair-raising ocean.. [4-64-5, 6]"
4-64-7,"On seeing the shoreless ocean that is like an endless sky, hence unnavigable, the vanara-s are despaired and said each to each, how to vault this ocean? [4-64-7]"
4-64-8,"Then the best one among monkeys, Angada, started to inspirit the army of monkeys who are anguished by fear on their gazing at the ocean. [4-64-8]"
4-64-9,"Loosing heart to dismay is an unworkability, because dismaying itself is detrimental, and dismay alone ruins a person, as a vicious viper unworkably ruins an innocent child... [4-64-9]"
4-64-10,"Individual achievement will be unachievable to him who readily braces himself with despair when the time for venturesomeness verges on, because of the lacking of his own vitality... So said Angada and then the nightfall has occurred. [4-64-10]"
4-64-11,"While that night is elapsing into the wee hours of next day, Angada met all the golden-ager monkeys, and again deliberated with them. [4-64-11]"
4-64-12,"When those troops of monkey army stood encircling Angada, it beamed forth like the army of gods encircling Indra. [4-64-12]"
4-64-13,"Who can capably consolidate that army of monkeys, other than Vali&#39;s son Angada, or, other than Hanuma? None. Because that army itself is an army of fickly, tickly monkeys. [4-64-13]"
4-64-14,"Then that enemy-subjugator and illustrious Angada, on revering the old-ager monkeys and paying due respects to the army of monkeys, spoke this meaningful sentence. [4-64-14]"
4-64-15,"Now, who is that great-resplendent one who can vault over the ocean and who is he who can facilitate the enemy-repressor Sugreeva to become truthful to his word... [4-64-15]"
4-64-16,"Who is that brave hurdler who can hurdle over a hundred yojana distance, oh, fly-jumpers, who is he who can even emancipate all these monkey commanders from the great fear of Sugreeva... [4-64-16]"
4-64-17,"By whose benignancy we can rejoicingly see our wives, sons, houses and homes on going back from here after achieving the purpose of our task... [4-64-17]"
4-64-18,"By whose benevolence we can unworriedly approach Rama, or even that irascible Lakshmana, or ruthless Sugreeva, as well... [4-64-18]"
4-64-19,"If someone among you is competent enough to jump over the ocean, that monkey may now quickly give us all, a munificence, called a solemn impunity from Sugreeva... Angada addressed monkeys in this way. [4-64-19]"
4-64-20,"On hearing Angada&#39;s words there is none someone to say something in that matter, as the entire monkey troop is as though dumbfounded. [4-64-20]"
4-64-21,"Again that best one among monkeys Angada clearly said to those monkeys thus, all of you are the best ones among powerful monkeys, you all are determinedly venturesome, born in flawless families and even adored again and again for your adventures... [4-64-21]"
4-64-22,"There will be no barrier to whomsoever, whensoever he wanted essay wheresoever, isn&#39;t it! Hence, oh, best fly-jumpers, each one you may give an account as to which one has got which capability in jump-leaping the ocean. [4-64-22]"
4-65-1,"Then on hearing the words of Angada those best vanara-s, anamely Gaja, Gavaaksha,Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, Mainda and Dvivida, and Susheshana, and like that Jambavanta haveindividually said about their abilities in the matter of leaping the ocean according to their turn.[4-65-1]"
4-65-2,"In that matter Gaja said, ""I can fly ten yojana-s..."" and Gavaaksha said, ""I can goover twenty yojana-s..."" [4-65-3]"
4-65-3,"In that matter the vanara Sharabha said to the monkeys, ""oh, fly-jumpers, I canindeed go up to thirty yojana-s..."" The vanara Sharabha said, ""I can go up to forty yojana-s,undoubtedly..."" The great-resplendent Gandhamaadana said, ""I can go up to fifty yojana-s, nodoubt..."" The vanara Mainda said the monkeys in that matter, ""I venture to jump just sixtyyojana-s..."" Then the great-resplendent Dvivida informed, ""I can go up to seventy yojana-s, nodoubt..."" But mighty Shushena, the best and the great resplendent monkey said, ""I promise to jumpeighty yojana-s..."" [4-65-4]"
4-65-4,"Jambavanta, the oldest one among all of them, appreciating them who are tellingabout their jumping capacities, has informed them in this way. [4-65-10]"
4-65-5,"Previously there was some traversal daredevilry even for us, such as we were, weare presently on the other shore of our age... [4-65-11]"
4-65-6,"That being so, for which purpose the king of monkeys Sugreeva and even Rama aredecisively decided on this task, it is impossible for us to marginalize this task... [4-65-12]"
4-65-7,"While we say you may hear what cruise we have at this age... we can go up to ninetyyojana-s, undoubtedly... [4-65-13]"
4-65-8,"Jambavanta further said this to all of those best monkeys, ""my capability in thestint of going was not definitely limited only thereunto... [4-65-14]"
4-65-9,"Once I have performed circumambulation around the Omnipresent and Eternal Vishnu inHis incarnation as Trivikrama, when He grandiosely increased His physique from that of aDivine-Dwarfish Brahman boy to that of an Omnidirectional Being, thus filling whole of the Universeto tread all the three worlds, during the time of Vedic-ritual of Emperor Bali, the legatee ofVairocana... [4-65-15]"
4-65-10,"Such as I was, I am presently old and decrepit and I have become slow jumpingsoldier of misfortune, though my energy in youth was unmatchable and unsurpassable. [4-65-16]"
4-65-11,"Now, at this age it is possible for me to go on my own only thereunto... and bythat much endeavour that task will be unaccomplished... So said Jambavanta to monkeys.[4-65-17]"
4-65-12,"Then on reverencing the great monkey Jambavanta, the highly intelligent Angadathereafter said these salutary words. [4-65-18]"
4-65-13,"I can vault over this ocean which is broadwise in a hundred yojana-breadth, butwhether I am capable of coming back or not, it is indefinite... [4-65-19]"
4-65-14,"That expert in sentence making, Jambavanta said to the best one among monkeys namelyAngada, ""oh, Angada, the best one among monkeys and bears, I know about your capability intraversal... [4-65-20]"
4-65-15,"Why a hundred, if need be you are capable to go up to a hundred thousand yojana-sand come back... but this method of our sending you is uncanonical... [4-65-21]"
4-65-16,"Oh, dear Angada, in anyway lord assigner cannot be an assignee, hence oh, bestfly-jumper, all of these people are assignable by you... [4-65-22]"
4-65-17,"You are notionally established as our lord and we have to become yourprotectionists and, oh, enemy-inflamer Angada, lord becomes the protectionist of army... this aloneis the method... [4-65-23]"
4-65-18,"Oh, enemy-subjugator, really you are the linchpin to this mission, thereby oh, dearAngada, you are always to be protected like anything that needs safeguarding... [4-65-24]"
4-65-19," 'The prime mover of a task is to be safeguarded...' is the byword of thetaskmasters, and indeed if only the prime mover is there, all the endowments are achievable thatyield fruits... [4-65-25]"
4-65-20,"Thereby, oh, truth-valiant Angada, you are instrumental to this task and as you areprivileged with sagacity and audacity, oh, enemy-inflamer, you are the keystone for this task ofsearching Seetha... [4-65-26]"
4-65-21,"For us you are indeed a respectable one by yourself, and as the son of respectedVali too, and oh, best monkey, sheltered by you we are indeed capable of achieving the objective ofour task... So said Jambavanta to Angada. [4-65-27]"
4-65-22,"When that highly scholarly Jambavanta has said thus, the great monkey and the son ofVali Angada said this sentence in reply as an answer. [4-65-28]"
4-65-23,"If I am not proceeding to Lanka, nor any other monkey is proceeding, then we haveto undertake self-immolation once again, isn't it! [4-65-29]"
4-65-24,"I do not perceive any secure protection for our lives on our going to Kishkindhawithout fulfilling the bidding of that resolute king of monkeys Sugreeva... [4-65-30]"
4-65-25,"Sugreeva is a lord who shows either forgiveness or furiousness immoderately... andour going to Kishkindha trespassing his bidding is as good as our entering into our own doom...[4-65-31]"
4-65-26,"It will happen in that way only as our going back to Kishkindha results in no otherway, thereby it will be apt of you to think deeply, as you can envision the implications... ThusAngada said to Jambavanta. [4-65-32]"
4-65-27,"When that best and valiant fly-jumper Jambavanta is said that way by Angada, thenJambavanta advised him in this best sentence to Angada. [4-65-33]"
4-65-28,"Oh, brave Angada, this mission of yours will not be thwarted in the least. I willmotivate him who achieves success of this mission of searching Seetha... [4-65-34]"
4-65-29,"Then Jambavanta, the outstanding one among monkeys started to motivate theexceptional fly-jumper, and a marvellous one among all the monkeys, and who by now is comfortablysitting abiding a lonely place, namely Hanuma. [4-65-35]"
4-66-1,"On overseeing the crestfallen monkey-soldiery, which is with many hundreds andthousands of soldiers, then Jambavanta sad this way to Hanuma. [4-66-1]"
4-66-2,"Oh, valiant one in the world of vanara-s, being an erudite scholar among all thescriptural scholars, Hanuma, why do not you mumble something, why do you resort to a calmlyloneliness... [4-66-2]"
4-66-3,"By your brilliance and brawn, oh, Hanuma, you match up to king of monkeys Sugreeva,or even to Rama and Lakshmana, as well... [4-66-3]"
4-66-4,"The son of Kashyapa Prajapati and Lady Vinata is the best bird among all the birdswho is superbly mighty and who is universally renowned as Garuda... [4-66-4]"
4-66-5,"Iindeed, I have oftentimes seen that highly glorious, rapidly speedy, great mightybird Garuda, pecking up reptiles from ocean... [4-66-5]"
4-66-6,"Whatever is the strength of his wings, that much is the strength of you arms, andeven by the yardsticks of his dash and dare, yours too, are unreprovable... [4-66-6]"
4-66-7,"Oh, forthright monkey, you are the finest among all beings by the dint of yourforce, faculty, flair, and fortitude... why then is your unreadiness in this task of leapingocean... [4-66-7]"
4-66-8,"Punjikasthala yclept Anjana is the nicest apsara among all apsara-s and she is thewife of Kesari, the monkey... [4-66-8]"
4-66-9,"She who is distinguished for her unparalleled mien in the three worlds, oh, dearboy Hanuma, had to take a rebirth on earth as a monkey who can change her form by her wish, owingto a curse... [4-66-9]"
4-66-10,"She who took birth as the daughter of great souled monkey chief Kunjara, onassuming a human physique, putting on caparisons of amazing garlands, dressed in silken clothing,and shining forth with rarity of her beauty and nubility, at one time ambled on the top of amountain like a streak of lightning athwart a black-cloud of rainy season. [4-66-10, 11]"
4-66-11,"When she is strolling on the mountaintop Air-god has slowly lifted up thatbroad-eyed lady's auspicious and ochry silk apparel with red rouches... [4-66-12]"
4-66-12,"Then the Air-god beheld her well-twinned, thickset, roundish thighs, and even thepaired off plumpish breasts, and her beautiful face which is well proportioned in its build...[4-66-13]"
4-66-13,"Just on catching the sight of that gorgeous one, whose pelvic-girdle is fat andample and who is slender-waisted, and who by all her limbs is pristine, the Air-god is enamoured...[4-66-14]"
4-66-14,"He that Air-god who is ensorcelled by Love-god in all of his limbs, though he islimbless and existing in thin air, embraced that immaculate lady with both of his far-flung arms,as he lost his heart for her... [4-66-15]"
4-66-15,"But she that conscientious lady perplexedly said this sentence in that matter ofinvisible hugging, 'who wishes to despoil my vow of one-man-one-wife...' [4-66-16]"
4-66-16,"On listening the words of Anjana the Air-god spoke this in reply, 'oh, high-hippedone, I don't dishonour you, hence let there be no fear in your heart, for I am the all-permeatingAir-god... [4-66-17]"
4-66-17," 'By which reason I embraced you and impregnate myself within you, by that reasonyou are impregnated in a supersensory manner, thereby you will beget a valiant son endowed withintellect... [4-66-18]"
4-66-18," 'An admirably brave, and a bravely dazzling, and a dazzlingly forceful, and aforcefully overpowering son will be there, also thus, he will be a coequal of mine in flying offand jumping up...' Thus, the Air-god said to Anjana. [4-66-19]"
4-66-19,"Oh, arcane monkey Hanuma, when Air-god said so to her, oh, ambidextrous one, yourmother is gratified, and then, oh, bullish fly-jumpers, your mother very well divined you in acave... [4-66-20]"
4-66-20,"Thereafter, when you were a boy you have see the just risen sun in the vast offorest, and deeming it to be a just ripen reddish fruit, and thinking it to be a best catch, youhopped up and flew towards sun on the sky... [4-66-21]"
4-66-21,"Even on your flying up three hundred yojana-s, oh, brave monkey, and even whensun's radiation puffed and blown you down, you did not get into any anguish as wereindefatigable... [4-66-22]"
4-66-22,"Oh, mighty monkey, even on seeing you who are coming near the vault of heaven,Indra is captivated by anger and by his effulgence he catapulted his Thunderbolt at you...[4-66-23]"
4-66-23,"Then, your left cheekbone, zygomatic arch, is broken when you fell down on ahighest mountaintop, from thereupon your name-phrase is indeed averred as <font color=#B3003A"">Hanumaan</font>... [4-66-24]"
4-66-24,"Then on observing that you are mutilated, highly infuriated is that scent-wafterAir-god and that tempestuous Air-god has not physically circulated throughout the triad ofworlds... [4-66-25]"
4-66-25,"When the triad of worlds is being roiled with breathlessness, all theadministrative gods of universe are bewildered, and they started to supplicate the Air-god for hisgrace... [4-66-26]"
4-66-26,"Oh, chivalric warrior at war, while the Air-god is being supplicated, oh, dear boy,Brahma gave you a boon decreeing your 'indestructibility by any missile...' [4-66-27]"
4-66-27,"On scrutinising that you are unhurt even after hit by Thunderbolt, oh, ablestHanuma, the Thousand-eyed Indra kind-heartedly gave you a choicest boon saying that your deathoccurs only by your own volition... [4-66-28, 29a]"
4-66-28,"Such as you are, you are Kesari's son through his wife, oh, frightful pugilist, andyou are the lineal son of Air-god, and even by your gusting you are selfsame to Air-god, and evenby your flying also you are his selfsame to Air-god, in all respects... [4-66-29b, 30]"
4-66-29,"Presently we are as good as dead, and among us presently you are the only one rifewith competence and valiance, you are the other Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, to us...[4-66-31]"
4-66-30,"During the period of Trivikrama incarnation I have circumambulated the earthinclusive of its mountains, forests and thickets for twenty-one times, moving rightward aroundit... [4-66-32]"
4-66-31,"Like that, by the order of gods we ourselves have collected those herbal plantswith which ambrosia had to be churned from Milky Ocean, and in that way, then there used to be agreat energy for us... [4-66-33]"
4-66-32,"Such as I am, I am now aged and my valiance is completely lessened... but at thepresent time, you alone are endowed with all endowments among us... [4-66-34]"
4-66-33,"Thereby oh, vanquisher Hanuma, you give a jump-start to leap the ocean. Indeed, youalone are the best one among all fly-jumpers, and this entire vanara army is anxious to witnessyour prowess... [4-66-35]"
4-66-34,"Arise, oh, lion-like monkey, leap over this vast ocean, oh, Hanuma, your escapevelocity is indeed unalike that of all the other beings... [4-66-36]"
4-66-35,"Oh, Hanuma, all these monkeys are dispirited. Why this indolence of yours? Youboldly triumph over the ocean as your speed is highest, supersonic, super-photic, super-cerebric isyour celerity. As with Vishnu who trod the triad of worlds in a trice, you too triumph over...Thus Jambavanta persuaded Hanuma to get ready for action. [4-66-37]"
4-66-36,"Thereafter, when the best monkey among monkeys, namely Jambavanta, the king of bearshas motivated, then that son of Air-god, Hanuma, whose speed is familiar coupled with hisirresistible enterprise, enormously increased his physique as though to gladded the army ofmonkeys. [4-66-38]"
4-67-1,"On seeing that best monkey Hanuma, who is burgeoning to cross over the hundredyojana-ocean and who is also quickly, progressively, and stupendously maximising his body, theother monkeys instantly shunning off their sadness, raved and rhapsodized over that staggeringlymighty monkey, Hanuma. [4-67-1, 2]"
4-67-2,"Those monkeys available all over there are altogether buoyed up and utterlyastounded, and as with the people who have enthusiastically seen Narayana when He maximised Hisphysique to tread the triad of worlds in His Trivikrama incarnation, these monkeys too are lookingat Hanuma who is now maximising his body. [4-67-3]"
4-67-3,"Hanuma who is already an outmatching monkey by way of his energy, has now accruedadded energy obtained through the gladness derived by the way of extolment from other monkeys, andthen he impetuously lashed his tail and oversized himself. [4-67-4]"
4-67-4,"His physique which is being reinforced with resplendence while all the monkey chiefsare eulogising him has become unsurpassed in its form. [4-67-5]"
4-67-5,"Hanuma, the lineal son of Air-god, is now prancing about as with a lion prancingaround a wide-open den of a mountain. [4-67-6]"
4-67-6,"While he is inflating the face of that clever Hanuma shone forth like a red-hotfrying pan and like the fumeless white-hot Ritual-fire. [4-67-7]"
4-67-7,"On bestirring himself from among the monkeys, and on reverencing the elderlymonkeys, Hanuma said this, with a spine-tingling sensation in his body. [4-67-8]"
4-67-8,"He who is an inestimable one in his formidableness, and an expeditious one in hismeandering in the skies, that Air-god who is the friend of Fire-god will be topplingmountaintops...... [4-67-9]"
4-67-9,"I am the lineal son of that high-speeded, brisk paced, life-sustaining Air-god,hence I am a coequal to him in flights... [4-67-10]"
4-67-10,"Indeed shall I venture to go round the Mt. Meru, which is standing like a broad andlofty scribe-pawl scribing on the sky, for thousands of times, that too, unremittingly...[4-67-11]"
4-67-11," Or, shall I venture to skew down the ocean with the speed of my undulating arms tospiral up its waters, in order to completely inundate the world together with its mountains, riversand lakes... [4-67-12]"
4-67-12,"Shall I shove up the ocean, the abode of Rain-god, with the speed of my thighs andcalves in order that its underwater beings like sharks, alligators and crocodiles will be shoved upand spilled all over... [4-67-13]"
4-67-13,"Shall I make circumambulations for thousands of times around the Lord of Birds andthe viper-diner, Garuda, while he is on the wing in the sky... [4-67-14]"
4-67-14,"Oh, best fly-jumpers, just by my astounding and astonishing impetuosity shall Iventure to start with the Sun who starts his journey of the day from Mt. Sunrise, and shall I go toMt. Dusk before Sun, and again shall I venture to comeback even before the sundown towards the sameday's flaming Sun when he is garlanded with flaming sunrays around him in midday, that too withoutmy touching the land... [4-67-15, 16]"
4-67-15,"Shall I overtake all the wayfarers in skyway, or shall I parch down the ocean, orpare off the earth... [4-67-17]"
4-67-16,"Or, shall I pulverise the mountains while fly-jumping on them, or oh, fly-jumpers,shall I splash out the waters great ocean just by the speed of my thighs while I fly over it, bywhich all of its water will trail after my tail... [4-67-18]"
4-67-17,"Or, shall I now let divers flowers of every climbing plant and tree straggle afterme when I fly by the sky... then my flight path will become like that of Star Swati and itsconstellate stars twinkling in the sky... [4-67-19]"
4-67-18,"Oh, vanara-s, shall I make all beings see my northerly ascent to the sky, mymovement across the vast of sky, and my southerly descent from the sky... [4-67-20b, 21a]"
4-67-19,"Oh, fly-jumpers, shall I show you a prodigious me spanning the sky like massive Mt.Meru and flying with a propulsive force as though to swallow the sky... [4-67-21b, 22a]"
4-67-20,"While flying self-assuredly shall I swipe at the cloudscape helter-skelter, orshall I swirl the mountains topsy-turvy, or shall I sere the ocean pell-mell... [4-67-22b, 22c]"
4-67-21,"Which forcefulness either the Divine Eagle, Garuda, or Air-god has, mine vies withthat... and no being is tangible who can follow up on me to overtake while I am on the wing,excepting for the king of eagles, Garuda and the almighty Air-god... [4-67-23]"
4-67-22,"Shall I penetrate the supportless sky in a split-second, like an electric-flashrocketing from a black-cloud in a trice? [4-67-24]"
4-67-23,"When I am jumping over the ocean, now my aspect will indeed become like that ofVishnu who in those days easily paced the triad of worlds just in three paces... [4-67-25]"
4-67-24,"Oh, fly-jumpers, I am clearly perceiving by my percipience and the differentstrokes of my perspicacity are similarly prognostic... and I avouch that I will descry Vaidehi...hence, rejoice yourselves... [4-67-26]"
4-67-25,"I who am a coequal of Air-god in speediness, and of Garuda in fleetness, cantraverse ten-thousand yojana-s at a stretch... that is my certitude... [4-67-27]"
4-67-26,"I will fetch that Elixir from the hands of Self-created Brahma, or from hands ofIndra even if he is wielding his Thunderbolt just on fleetly triumphing over him... or, I can evenbring isle of Lanka itself extracting it from the ocean... thus is my confidence... So said Hanumato other monkeys. [4-67-28]"
4-67-27,"While that choicest vanara with illimitable resplendence, namely Hanuma, is roaringout his capabilities in the matter of leaping ocean on enormously increasing his physique, all theother monkeys are stunned to stare overhead at his aggrandized form and thus they are extremelygladdened.. [4-67-29b]"
4-67-28,"On hearing the avouchment of Hanuma, which itself is an annihilator of the anguishof his kinsmen, then the king of fly-jumpers Jambavanta is very much gladdened and said. [4-67-29b,30a]"
4-67-29,"Oh, brave one, oh, son of Kesari, oh, son of Air-god, oh, dear boy, you have wipedout the boundless bother of your kinsmen in its entirety... [4-67-30b, 31a]"
4-67-30,"The monkey leaders forgathered here are enamoured of your blessedness, and for thepurpose of your attainment of the object, they all obsecrate orisons, devoutly... [4-67-31b,32a]"
4-67-31,"You will leap over the extensive ocean with the compassion of sages, choice ofelderly monkeys, and with the consideration of our oracular teachers... [4-67-32b, 33a]"
4-67-32,"Each of us will stay here on one's own single-foot till you arrive, as the lives ofall the forest dwelling monkeys are following you... Thus Jambavanta blessed Hanuma to initiateaction. [4-67-33b, 34a]"
4-67-33,"Then that tigerly monkey Hanuma said to the forest dwelling monkeys, ""Even so, inthis world whosoever he might be, either animate or inanimate being, he cannot possibly bear thebrunt of my bouncing... [4-67-34b, 35a]"
4-67-34,"This Mt. Mahendra is beaming forth with boulders and altitudinal cliffs, and thecrests of this mountain are indeed tough, and even towering... [4-67-35b, 36a]"
4-67-35,"Diversely outspreaded are its trees, and divers are its transuding ores, thus thismountain is shining forth... hence, from the peaks of this Mt. Mahendra I will gain speed for mykick-start... [4-67-36b, 37a]"
4-67-36,"On the verge of my upstart from here for a hundred yojana-s, these sturdy crags aresure to withstand the impetus of that kick-start... [4-67-37b, 38a]"
4-67-37,"Then that monkey who is the son of Air-god and a selfsame of Air-god shinned up thattowering mountain Mahendra, as he is an enemy-subjugator about to subjugate the arch rival Ravana,where that mountain is hedged in with diverse flowers, its pastures are the sweethearts of deer, itis constrictive with diverse flowers of ever flowering, ever fruiting trees and with the flowers ofclimbers as well, and where lions and tigers are freely moving and ruttish elephants love it, andwhere the flights of birds are uproarious, and pent-up rapids are clangourous. [4-67-39, 40,41]"
4-67-38,"He who is equal in valour to the Paradisiacal Mahendra, that highly energetic andgrand monkey Hanuma ambled on loftiest and towery crags of such a mountain. [4-67-42]"
4-67-39,"When squeezed by both the arms and hands of that high souled Hanuma, that loftymountain trumpeted, as if it is a lion-paw-hit brutish-elephantine-elephant. [4-67-43]"
4-67-40,"Virtually and widely bestrewn are the heaps of boulders, essentially scared are allthe animals and elephants, and actually rocked are the gigantic trees, and its rapids andwaterfalls have spouted out of that mountain by the impact of foot-stepping of Hanuma.[4-67-44]"
4-67-41,"Then, the numerous gandharva couples and the hoards of vidhyaadhara-s even, that areindulged in drinking and inebriated on that mountain are forsaking those lofty cliffs of thatmountain, and even the birds are put to flight, spanking snakes are completely slouching, andrising up and falling down are the stones of that mountaintops to each step of Hanuma, and thusthat colossal mountain is desolated. [4-67-45, 46]"
4-67-42,"With snakes popping up halfway through their snake-pits with their hoods swaying andtongues hissing that earth-borne mountain Mahendra appeared to be a gleaming mountain with flyingflags. [4-67-47]"
4-67-43,"While the sages are forsaking that towering mountain as their own scare bewilderingthem, that mountain appeared to be one who is desolated by his associates in the vast of a thick offorest, as a wilting wayfarer. [4-67-48]"
4-67-44,"And he who is an importantly brave monkey among all the monkeys, an eliminator ofenemy stalwarts, that highly proficient, expeditious, and conscientious Hanuma, on stabilising hisimpulses and making soul is quite staid in speediness, he made head away to Lanka, instinctually.[4-67-49]"
4-67-45,"Thus, this is the 66th, and conclusive chapterof Kishkindha Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India."
5-1-1,"After that, Hanuma, the destroyer of foes, desired to travel in the sky where celestials like chaaranas tread, to search for Seetha, who was taken away by Ravana."
5-1-2,"Hanuma who desired to perform a deed done by no one else, shone like a bull without any obstacles, with his stretched neck and raised head."
5-1-3,"After that, the mighty and courageous Hanuma roamed at ease on the lawns with the hue of an emerald, which looked like still water from a distance."
5-1-4,"The thoughtful Hanuma tread like a rampant lion, making birds fear, uprooting trees by his breast and also killing many animals."
5-1-5,"That great monkey Hanuma shone like an elephant in a lake, standing on the foot of that great mountain by the name of Mahendra, where many elephants of good breed resided, which was beautifully decorated with many naturally formed mineral rocks of varied hue like black, white, red, blue, yellow and green and which was surrounded by godly serpents and Yakshas, Kinnaras, Gandharvas who were capable of assuming desired form, together with their families."
5-1-6,"He saluted with joined palms to the Sun-God, Lord Indra, God of Wind, Lord Brahma and Bhutas and decided to leave."
5-1-7,"Hanuma turned towards east, saluted his father, the Lord of Wind and increased his body to go towards southern direction."
5-1-8,"With all the Vaanaras seeing, Hanuma decided to fly and like an ocean swelling on full moon days, grew for Rama's success."
5-1-9,"With a desire to cross the ocean, Hanuma grew his body immeasurably and pressed the mountain with his feet and hands."
5-1-10,"Thus tormented by Hanuma, that mountain shook for an instant and showered all flowers of trees on it."
5-1-11,"Covered all through by those fragrant flowers which fell down from the trees, that mountain shone like a mountain made of flowers."
5-1-12,"That mountain shed water like an elephant in rut emitting rut juice, after being pressed by the mighty Hanuma."
5-1-13,"Pressed by that mighty Hanuma, streaks of gold silver and antimony color appeared on the Mahendra mountain."
5-1-14,"Huge Rocks of Sulfur were also shot forth from that mountain, just as a fire burning with a medium flame would emit columns of smoke."
5-1-15,"Being pressed on all sides by the mountain which itself was being pressed by Hanuma, creatures living in the caves of that mountain shrieked in horrifying tones."
5-1-16,"That loud noise from creatures which emanated because of stress caused to the mountain, filled the earth and all four directions and forests near that mountain."
5-1-17,"Great snakes with clear swastika signs on their hoods, spewed out frightening flames with their great heads and bit the rocks with their teeth."
5-1-18,"Then those great rocks bit by those snakes with anger and venom, burned due to the flame and split into thousand pieces."
5-1-19,"Medicinal herbs from that mountain, although capable of destroying ordinary poisons, could not neutralize the poison from those snakes."
5-1-20,"Ascetics residing on that mountain flew away from there thinking that some demons were destroying it. Vidhyadharas who lived there, became afraid and flew away with their women folk, leaving behind them golden jugs of wine in the liquor house, gold vases, a varieties of sauces that can be licked, eatables, various meats, skins of oxen and swords with golden hilts."
5-1-21,"The intoxicated Vidyadharas with garlands around their neck decked with red flower garlands and smeared with sandal paste, with reddened eyes, and with lotus shaped eyes, obtained the sky."
5-1-22,"Vidyadhara women wearing necklaces, anklets, armlets and bangles stood in the sky with surprise and with smiles along with their loved ones."
5-1-23,"Vidyadharas and great sages stood in the sky in a group, showing their great prowess and viewed the mountain."
5-1-24,"Then they heard words of Charanas, Siddhas and pure hearted Rishis who were located in that clear sky."
5-1-25,"This Hanuma, who is equal to a mountain, who is the son of Vayu, and who has great speed, wants to cross the ocean which is abode to crocodiles."
5-1-26,"Hanuma has decided to perform an impossible task for the sake of Rama and Vanaras and wants to obtain the other side of ocean which is hard to obtain."
5-1-27,"Vidyadharas thus listened to the words of those great people and looked at the incomparable Hanuma, best among Vanaras, standing on the mountain."
5-1-28,"He, who is equal to a mountain, shook his hair, quivered his body and let out a great roar like from a vast cloud."
5-1-29,"About to fly, Hanuma jolted his tail, which was rolled into a circle from top to bottom, and which was covered with hair, just as Garuda, the king of birds would jolt a snake."
5-1-30,"Receiving his vigor, the tail curled at his back was seen like a great serpent being stolen by Garuda."
5-1-31,"Hanuma firmly supported his arms (on the mountain surface) which resembled huge iron clubs, crouched the waist and contracted his feet."
5-1-32,"Bending shoulders and neck, that mighty and glorious Hanuma, increased his energy, strength and courage."
5-1-33,"With his eyes raised up, seeing the way from a distance, viewing the sky, he held his breath in his heart."
5-1-34,"That mighty Hanuma, equal to an elephant among monkeys and the best among Vaanaraas, stood firmly with his legs, bent his ears and before flying spoke these words to the Vaanaraas."
5-1-35,"""I will go to the city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana just like an arrow released by Rama will go, with wind-like speed. If I do not see the daughter of Janaka there, I will go with the same speed to the abode of gods. If I do not see Seetha there in heaven, I will get Ravana the king of raakshasaas tied up in chains without any effort. I will, in all events, return successfully along with Seetha or I will get Lanka along with Ravana after uprooting it."""
5-1-36,"The best among Vaanaraas, Hanuma, spoke in this way to Vaanaraas and then without thinking about anything else, flew up with lot of vigor. That great monkey also thought himself equal to Garuda, the king of birds."
5-1-37,"While he was flying up, due to that force, all trees on that mountain flew away in all directions, drawing together all their branches."
5-1-38,"While flying in the sky, he took along with him, because of the force of his thighs, trees shining with flowers and with fattened lapwing birds."
5-1-39,"The trees thus being held aloft by the speed of Hanuma's thighs, followed him for a while just as relatives would follow their loved ones embarking on a long journey."
5-1-40,"Uprooted by the force of Hanuma's thighs, Sal and other excellent trees followed Hanuma like soldiers following their king."
5-1-41,"Hanuma the great monkey presented a wonderful sight, with his mountain-like appearance together with the well flowered trees."
5-1-42,"After that, powerful trees sank into the salt ocean like mountains sinking into ocean due to fear of Mahendra."
5-1-43,"That Hanuma who was equal to a cloud, covered with flowers of various kinds, shoots and buds, shone like a mountain with fireflies."
5-1-44,"Those trees which were released by Hanuma's speed, dropped flowers and fell down in the water like friends going back after bidding farewell to their dear one."
5-1-45,"Set in motion by the wind from the movement of Hanuma, that variety of blossom, with various hues, from the trees fell down into the sea. That great ocean shone like the sky filled with stars."
5-1-46,"Hanuma shone like a cloud in the sky decorated by lightening, with flowers of various hues sticking to his body."
5-1-47,"That sea water looked like the sky with delightful stars rising up, with flowers flown up by Hanuma's speed."
5-1-48,"That sky-borne Hanuma's arms which were spread out, were seen like five-headed serpents coming out of a mountain's peak."
5-1-49,"That great monkey shone like one who is drinking the great sea together with its waves. He also seemed like one who desires to drink the whole of sky."
5-1-50,"The eyes of that Hanuma, who was following the path of sky, which had a brilliance equal to that of lightening, were shining like two fires on a mountain."
5-1-51,"The round, wide, reddish brown eyes of Hanuma, the best among the monkeys shone like fully risen sun and moon."
5-1-52,"The ruddy face of Hanuma, with His reddish face shone like the Sun touched by twilight."
5-1-53,"The tail of Hanuma, the son of Vayu floating in the sky, being risen up looked like the pillar erected in honour of Indra."
5-1-54,"The great intellectual Hanuma, with his great body, and with white teeth, shone like the Sun, being surrounded by his circular tail."
5-1-55,"That great monkey Hanuma, with his red colored buttocks, shone like a mountain with a large deposit of red Gairika herb broken into pieces."
5-1-56,"Air passing through the lion among monkeys Hanuma's arm pits sounded like a thundering cloud."
5-1-57,"The best among monkeys Hanuma flying thus in the sky, looked like a meteor darting away with great speed in the sky from northern direction."
5-1-58,"With a fast pace equaling that of Sun god, the tall Hanuma shone like an elephant which increases its size when being festered by a rope."
5-1-59,"Then Hanuma who was flying above the ocean with his body above the ocean and his shadow being immersed in the sea below, looked like a boat being driven by wind."
5-1-60,"Whatever place Hanuma went towards on the ocean, that place became agitated due to the force of thighs."
5-1-61,"That great monkey with great speed flew in the sky striking with his chest series of waves which had a great body like that of mountains."
5-1-62,"Wind from the mighty Hanuma and the wind released from the clouds caused the ocean with a fearful sound to shake a lot."
5-1-63,"Hanuma flew in the sky dragging along with him big waves from the ocean as though he were sprinkling them in the sky."
5-1-64,"Hanuma with great speed crossed waves which were equal to Mount Meru and Mount Mandara, that had risen up in the sea, as if counting them."
5-1-65,"Then the water together with clouds which was driven up by the force of Hanuma, shone like a stretched autumnal cloud in the sky."
5-1-66,"Then various whales, fishes, turtles and crocodiles were being seen clearly in the sea just as bodies of humans would be seen when clothes are removed."
5-1-67,"Serpents living in the sea saw Hanuma flying in the sky and thought that it was Garuda, the king of birds."
5-1-68,"Hanuma's shadow which was ten yojanas wide and thirty yojanas long appeared very beautiful on water."
5-1-69,"That shadow which was following Hanuma and spread on the ocean, shone like a series of dense white clouds."
5-1-70,"That great monkey Hanuma, the great resplendent one with a huge body, shone like a mountain with wings flying in the sky without any support underneath."
5-1-71,"In whatever path Hanuma the mighty one went, in that path, there immediately appeared a trough in the ocean below."
5-1-72,"Hanuma while coursing through the path of birds like the king of birds Garuda, dragged with him series of clouds like the god of wind."
5-1-73,"Great clouds with white, red, blue and madder colors shone on being dragged by Hanuma."
5-1-74,"Hanuma who is repeatedly entering and leaving series of clouds as He flies in the sky, is being seen like the moon who shines and is hidden alternately."
5-1-75,"Then, on seeing Hanuma flying quickly in the sky, Devas, Gandharvas and Danavas showered flowers on him."
5-1-76,"Then, the Sun did not scorch Hanuma, the best among Vanaras, who was flying for Rama's welfare. The wind god Vayu also served him with a delightful breeze."
5-1-77,"Sages praised the great resplendent Hanuma flying in the sky. Devas and Gandharvas also sang in His praise."
5-1-78,"Immediately on seeing the best among monkeys, Hanuma, flying without any effort, Nagas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Devas and birds all praised Him."
5-1-79,"While that best among vanaras, Hanuma, was flying, the god of ocean thought thus for the respect of Ikshvaaku dynasty:"
5-1-80,"""If I do not help this best among vanaras Hanuma, I shall become prone to all kinds of ill-talk by those who want to speak against me."""

5-1-82,"""I have to behave in such a way that Hanuma would take rest. After resting in me for a while, He can cross the remaining distance with comfort."""

5-1-84,"""O best among mountains Mainaka! You have been positioned here by Devendra as an obstacle to the groups of asuras living in paataala."""

5-1-93,"The mountain with gold in the middle, Mainaka, listening to the words of the salty ocean, got up quickly from the water, together with great trees and creepers."
5-1-94,"Then that Mainaka became in the risen state, passing through the ocean water, just like the Sun piercing through a cloud with His shining rays"
5-1-95,"That great Mainaka who was covered by water in all directions, who had peaks with Kinnaras and great serpents, which were equal to a sun rise, which were touching the sky, and which had a golden hue, being ordered by the ocean, showed his peaks in an instant."
5-1-96,"The sky which had a bluish tinge like that of a sword, shone with a golden hue because of the peaks of the mountain which rose up and which was like molten gold."
5-1-97,"That best among mountains became equal to a hundred suns with its peaks which had a golden hue and which were shining with a self generated shine."
5-1-98,"Hanuma on seeing the mountain which stood before Him, rising up from the middle of the salty ocean suddenly, decided that it as an obstacle."
5-1-99,"That great monkey Hanuma with a great speed, brought that great tall mountain with His chest just as the God of wind would a cloud."

5-9-69,"Thus, this is the 9th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epicpoem of India."
5-10-1,"In that house, while observing, Hanuma saw a portion of house with beds and couches, consisting of best couches equaling those in heaven, made of crystal decorated with diamonds, with wonderful parts made of ivory and gold, covered with best beds made of cat&#39;s eye gems of great value."
5-10-2,"Hanuma saw in a part of that room, an umbrella white in colour decorated with best flower garlands and resembling moon - the lord of stars."
5-10-3,"Hanuma saw an excellent couch made of gold with radiance equaling that of fire, spread by garlands of Ashoka flowers."
5-10-4,"Fanned by women with fans in their hands in all the four directions and obtained by various fragrances fumigated by the best incense."
5-10-5,"Covered by an excellent bed, spread by sheep skin everywhere and shone by rows of excellent garlands."
5-10-6,"Hanuma saw Ravana in that house, equaling a cloud, wearing earrings with a brilliant shine with red eyes and with long arms wearing gold clothes."
5-10-7,"With his body smeared with red sandal-wood with good fragrance like a cloud in the red sky at sunset, together with groups of lightening."
5-10-8,"Ravana was filled with excellent jewellery, with a good appearance, with an ability to assume desired form, resembling mount Mandara in sleep, together with groups of trees and bushes."
5-10-9,"Resting after having pleasure at night, bedecked with the best ornaments, he was a lover to the rakshasa girls and causing comfort to rakshasas."
5-10-10,"That great Hanuma saw the gallant king of rakshasas in sleep on a shining couch resting after drinking."
5-10-11,"That Hanuma, best among Vanaras neared Ravana, became very gloomy and moved away with great dread, as though from a hissing serpent."
5-10-12,"Thereafter the great Hanuma neared staircase, sought another dais and observed closely Ravana."
5-10-13,"The excellent couch of the sleeping Ravana shone like a great lake when a scented elephant resides in it."
5-10-14,"That Hanuma also saw the wealthy Ravana&#39;s arms tied with golden armlets thrown apart, resembling flag staffs raised in honor of Indra."
5-10-15,"Those arms had wounds made by stabbing from the pointed edges of tusks of Iraavata and fleshy shoulders smeared with diamond and hit by Vishnu chakra."
5-10-16,"These arms of Ravana were corpulent with well grown and equal strong shoulders proportionate to body, with knees and thumbs of good characteristics, with good fingers and palms."
5-10-17,"With strong joints in the shape of club, round in shape resembling the trunks of an elephant, like five headed snakes thrown on clean couch."

5-10-19,"That Hanuma saw there arms on the couch like great serpents in anger sleeping in the middle of mount Mandara."
5-10-20,"That king of Rakshasas equaling a mountain with those shoulders, which were well built and shone like Mount Mandara with twin peaks."
5-10-21,"From the great face of that king of Rakshasas who was sleeping, came out breath with fragrance like that of flowers of chuuta and punnaaga, consisting of the best fragrance of Vakula flowers, together with the flavor of best cooked rice, with the smell of liquor as though filling that house."
5-10-22,"That Hanuma saw in the house of that king of Rakshasa&#39;s, wives at the feet, Ravana being a gigantic one with loving wives, shone with crown tilted to the side, having strange hue with pearls and diamonds and of golden colour, with a face made brilliant by earrings, shone with the chest region smeared with red sandal, shining with a necklace wide, high and corpulent with a silk cloth of white colour falling on him, with eyes reddish like blood, well tied by a best cloth of yellow colour and of very best quality, resembling a heap of black beans, snoring like a hiss of a snake, like an elephant sleeping in the middle of water belonging to the great river Ganga with all the four directions shone by the four lamps of golden colour, resembling a cloud with all the parts being shone by groups of lighting."
5-10-23,"The leader of Vanaras saw those wives of Ravana with faces with radiance of moon, adorned with beautiful earrings, wearing jewellery and flower garlands which were not worn out."
5-10-24,"Hanuma saw wives of Ravana with skill in dance and musical instruments, who obtained the shoulders of Ravana wearing the best jewellery and being in sleep."
5-10-25,"He saw earrings of those women at the end of ears with embedded diamonds and cats eye gems and having golden colour."
5-10-26,"With the faces of those women with delicate earrings which were equal to moon and auspicious that house shone like the sky with clusters of stars."
5-10-27,"Women of that Ravana being tired from lustful passion and exertion and having lean waists slept at first opportunity."
5-10-28,"Another woman with skill in dancing consisting of delicate body postures slept in the same way with all her body parts making the same dance postures."

5-10-43,"Hanuma saw Mandodari with a beautiful form together with diamonds and pearls, well decorated by jewellery and with her self radiance as though decorating that great building with a fair complexion and with a radiance like golden colour, who was dear to her husband the lady of women in that gynaeceum sleeping there."
5-10-44,"That Hanuma with great arms seeing the woman well decorated, out of logic thought thus: This is Seetha by the wealth of her appearance and her youth. That warrior of Vanaras was delighted together with great pleasure."
5-10-45,"He clasped his arms, kissed his tail he was delighted, he was playful, sang, paced showing his simian nature, climbed pillars and fell down on land."
5-11-1,"The great Hanuma then removing that thought became with the right mind and had another thought about Seetha."
5-11-2,"That Seetha is not suitable to sleep separated from Rama, will not eat, will not decorate also, not suited to drink a beverage, to reach another man even though if he were Indra because there is indeed no one equaling Rama even among gods. This is another woman - thus deciding that Hanuma paced in that banqueting hall."
5-11-3,"Some women were tired from erotic dalliance and then some other women were tired from singing; some others were weary from dance and were unconscious from consumption of liquor."
5-11-4,"Some women were stationed on tabors, on Mrudangas, on seats, some other women rested on chief carpets."
5-11-5,"The warrior among Vanaras saw a thousand of women decorated by jewellery with a nature of talking about beauty, conversing about the correct meaning of songs being sung, behaving according to time and place, wont to speak appropriate words, indulged in sleep after sexual dalliance."
5-11-6,"In the middle of that group of women, Ravana with great arms shone like a bull in the middle of cows in a big cow-pen."

5-11-8,"The best among Vanaras saw in that wealthy Ravana&#39;s house a bar also, consisting of all desirables."
5-11-9,"Hanuma saw there in that bar, meat of dear and of buffalo, of wild boar kept separately."
5-11-10,"The best among Vanaras saw half eaten peacocks and chicken in wide vessels of golden colour."
5-11-11,"Hanuma observed meat of pigs and goats, porcupines, deer and peacocks preserved in curds and sochal salt."
5-11-12,"Hanuma saw birds called Krakara cooked ready to be eaten in variety of ways, birds called Chakoras half eaten, wild buffalos, fishes called ekashleya, goats, food to be licked of various kinds, beverages and various foods."
5-11-13,"In the same way that floor was obtaining glory greatly with Ragas and Shadabas seasoned with sour and salty sauces, with necklaces, anklets and armlets of great value thrown around, with various fruits left in drinking vessels, with flowers sprinkled."
5-11-14,"That bar was seen as though radiant without fire, with couches and chairs well arranged and placed there and there."
5-11-15,"Many meats of different kinds cultured with various best seasonings, well arranged separately obtained that bar."
5-11-16,"Excellent and clear various liquors, a liquor called Sura, liquor made of sugar, liquor made of honey, liquor made of flowers and liquors made of fruits also, artificially made liquors - those and those were cultured separately with various fragrant powders."
5-11-17,"The floor shone filled by flower garlands in a variety of forms, with various vessels of golden hue and also made of crystal, filled with other small vessels of golden colour."
5-11-18,"Hanuma saw indeed then lot of best quality liquor in pots of silver and of golden colour."
5-11-19,"That great Hanuma saw vessels full of liquor of golden colour, embedded with gem stones and also of silver hue."
5-11-20,"That Hanuma saw indeed at some places drinks half filled and at some places completely drunk and some places not at all drunk."
5-11-21,"Hanuma paced about seeing at some places various eatables and at some places drinks separately, and at some places remnants of cooked rice."
5-11-22,"Hanuma saw some places with vessels broken, some places with pots in shambles, some places with water together with flower garlands and fruits."
5-11-23,"Here couches again of women were varied and clean, some best women slept there hugging one another."
5-11-24,"Some women conquered by the power of sleep pulled other sleeping women&#39;s clothing and slept covering themselves."
5-11-25,"Clothing and garland on the throats of those women was moving slightly and wonderfully as though obtaining air from the air of breath."
5-11-26,"There wind blew carrying in a lot of directions, a variety of fragrances of cool sandal-paste and of sweet liquor, of various flower garlands and of various kinds of agallocum fumes."
5-11-27,"Then the blossoming fragrance from the baths and sandal paste and from agallocum fumes blew spreading all around in that Pushpaka plane."
5-11-28,"There in that Ravana&#39;s house, some women had fair and white complexion some best women were black, some women had a body of golden complexion."
5-11-29,"Appearance of those sleeping women, tired from being possessed by sleep and from lust, was like lotuses sleeping."
5-11-30,"Hanuma with great radiance thus saw entire Ravana&#39;s house completely but did not see Seetha."
5-11-31,"Then that Hanuma seeing those women obtained great anguish being in doubt because of fear in the matter of dharma."
5-11-32,"My seeing sleeping house of other people&#39;s wives will do a great deficit to dharma."
5-11-33,"My sight is indeed not in the matter of other wives here. These other&#39;s wives have been seen by me."
5-11-34,"To that Hanuma with an excellent mind, with a fixed and concentrated mind, was born another thought again, showing a fixed resolve in the task at hand."
5-11-35,"All Ravana&#39;s women who were in faith could have been seen by me; to my mind there indeed was not even a little disturbance."
5-11-36,"Among auspicious or inauspicious states in the behavior of all senses mind is the reason. My that mind is very steady."
5-11-37,"By me it is not possible to search Seetha at another place. Always during search women will be seen among other women."
5-11-38,"To an animal of whatever race that animal is searched in that race; a woman missing is not possible to be searched among female deer."
5-11-39,"For that reason all this Ravana&#39;s house has been search by me with a pure mind Seetha alone cannot be seen."
5-11-40,"The strong Hanuma observing girls from devas, gandharvas and girls from nagas did not see Janaki."
5-11-41,"The powerful Hanuma not seeing Her there and seeing other best women then started to think deeply going far from there."
5-11-42,"That Hanuma the glorious one adopting a great task again left that bar and began to search that house."
5-12-1,"That Hanuma interested in sight of Seetha, in the middle of that building, went towards houses made of plant creepers, art houses, and nocturnal houses but did not see Her with a beautiful appearance."
5-12-2,"That great Hanuma then later not seeing that Seetha dear to Rama thought thus: to me searching Seetha in whatever way appearance not being obtained, from that Seetha definitely has died."
5-12-3,"That Seetha standing in the best traditional path being chaste interested, in preserving her character must have been killed by the king of these Rakshasas who performed evil deeds - this is certain."
5-12-4,"That daughter of King Janaka died of fear seeing the wives of Ravana with crooked appearances - horrible ones without radiance with great faces with long and crooked eyes."
5-12-5,"Without seeing Seetha, not obtaining destiny and wandering for a long time together with Vanaras, to me there is not a path to go near Sugreeva. Sugreeva has a sharp punishment and also is strong."
5-12-6,"All inner city has been seen. Women of Ravana have been seen. The chaste Seetha has not been seen. My effort became wastefull."
5-12-7,"To me who has gone back all Vanaras after meeting what they would say? O strong one! Going there, what has been done by you? Tell that to us."
5-12-8,"Without seeing that Seetha what can I say? Due to passing of time, definitely they will obtain fire."
5-12-9,"To me who had gone for the other shore of the ocean what will the old Jambavan say? What would that Angada and vanaras who meet say?"
5-12-10,"Non-depression is root of development. Absence of despondency is the greatest comfort. Self reliance always is indeed the promoter in all matters."
5-12-11,"Whatever action a human does that action of man is made to be successful by non-depression. For that reason I will perform a best effort together with non-depression. I will search all those regions ruled by Ravana not yet seen."
5-12-12,"Bars have been searched; in the same way flower houses, art houses have been searched; again pleasure houses, pathways in the middle of gardens, buildings in all directions have been searched."
5-12-13,"Thus thinking Hanuma began to search again undergrounds, houses at the beginning of street intersections and also small houses faraway from the main houses."
5-12-14,"The great Hanuma flying again and again and jumping down, standing up, walking, opening doors, pushing doors and entering inside, coming out, climbing down, climbing up wandered all opportunity."
5-12-15,"That Hanuma in that city of Ravana - whatever region he did not go that region was not there even for four angulas."
5-12-16,"Streets between fort walls, platforms together with the intersection of four streets, wells, lakes all these had been seen by him."
5-12-17,"Rakshasa women of various forms, with crooked forms and horrific forms had been seen there by Hanuma but not that Seetha."
5-12-18,"The best Vidhyadhara women incomparable by beauty in the world had been seen there by Hanuma, but not Seetha."
5-12-19,"Naaga women with beautiful buttocks, with faces equaling full moon had been seen by Hanuma there, but not Seetha with a beautiful waist."
5-12-20,"Naaga women who had been stolen forcefully, being defeated by Ravana had been seen there by Hanuma, not that Seetha"
5-12-21,"That Hanuma with great arms, the wise one, the son of Vayu not seeing that Seetha and seeing other women became depressed again and again."
5-12-22,"Seeing the effort of the best Vanaras and the crossing of ocean as being wasted, Hanuma got depression again."
5-12-23,"Thereafter the son of Vayu Hanuma got down from Pushpaka, obtained thought with a mind overcome with grief."
5-13-1,"Hanuma the leader of Vanaras crossed from pushpaka toward the fort wall and became with speed like lighting in the middle of a cloud."
5-13-2,"The simian Hanuma went far from the house of Ravana and not seeing Seetha, the daughter of King Janaka, said these words:"
5-13-3,"The city of Lanka has been mostly explored by me attempting for the pleasure of Rama. But I am unable to see Seetha, beautiful in all limbs, and the daughter of Videha."
5-13-4,"All earth consisting of pools, ponds, lakes and streams, rivers and forest areas filled with water, mountains difficult of access have been explored but I did not see Seetha."
5-13-5,"It has been said by the eagle King Sampati that Seetha is here in the house of Ravana. I am unable to see her."
5-13-6,"Otherwise Seetha belonging to Videha born in Mithila and daughter of king Janaka - Can she be helplessly together with the evil minded Ravana."
5-13-7,"I think while Ravana fearing Rama&#39;s arrows flew quickly carrying Seetha, she might have fallen down in the middle of the journey."
5-13-8,"Or I think the heart of the noble Seetha being stolen in the path served by Siddhas must have sunk at the site of the ocean."
5-13-9,"I think due to great speed of Ravana and due to the torture of Ravana&#39;s shoulders the life has been given up by that noble one with wide eyes."
5-13-10,"Then while being flown upon the surface of the ocean, Seetha definitely fell down in the ocean while wriggling."
5-13-11,"Or has the austere Seetha been eaten by this Ravana, the evil minded one while she was protecting her chastity without any relatives near her."
5-13-12,"Otherwise not being evil with black eyes, She may have been eaten by the wives of Ravana with evil thoughts."
5-13-13,"The pitiable Seetha equaling full moon, with eyes equaling lotus petals must have obtained death while meditating upon Rama&#39;s face."
5-13-14,"The daughter of Videha, Seetha. �O Rama!&#39; �O Lakshmana!&#39; �O Ayodhya!&#39;, thus weeping greatly may have given up her body."
5-13-15,"I think otherwise being put in the house of Ravana Seetha is definitely crying like a caged myna."
5-13-16,"How can the daughter of King Janaka, Rama&#39;s wife Seetha with a beautiful waist, with eyes like black lotus petals obtain Ravana&#39;s capture."
5-13-17,"It is not fair to let know Rama who has a dear wife if Seetha is lost or is not to be seen or has died."
5-13-18,"To be let known becomes an error; not to let know becomes an error how to perform the duty? To me this seems dire situation."
5-13-19,"This task while it goes this way the time is approaching. What becomes appropriate thus Hanuma thought again this view point."
5-13-20,"If I go towards Sugreeva&#39;s city from here without seeing Seetha from that to what avail will this effort be?"
5-13-21,"My crossing of the ocean entering the city of Lanka the site of rakshasas - all this will become waste."
5-13-22,"To me reaching Kishkindha what would Sugreeva say or Vanaras there or those sons of Dasharatha what would they say?"
5-13-23,"Going there by me for Rama, �Seetha has not been seen&#39; - thus if I say a very unpleasant word thereafter Rama will give up life."
5-13-24,"Hearing bad word belonging to Seetha that is harsh, horrible, cruel, sharp, sense agonizing, He will not exist."
5-13-25,"Seeing that Rama being with troubles, being with a heart towards death, Lakshmana, one with great love and an intellectual will not exist."
5-13-26,"Hearing brothers to be dead, Bharata also will die. Seeing the dead Bharata, Shatrughana also will not exist."
5-13-27,"Thereafter seeing sons to be dead the mothers Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi will not exist - there is no doubt."
5-13-28,"Grateful, true to pledge Sugreeva, the leader of Vanaras, seeing Rama the leader of Vanaras seeing Rama die in that way will give up life thereafter."
5-13-29,"Being tortured by the sorrow of husband, made sad by a gloomy heart, disconsolate without happiness, to be pitied, Ruma will give up life."
5-13-30,"Being distressed from the sorrow of Vali, being emaciated from grief, Tara also will not exist while the king Sugreeva is obtaining death."
5-13-31,"The young Angada also from the death of mother and father, from the grief of Sugreeva - why will he retain life?"
5-13-32,"Vanaras being rejected by the sorrow due to their lord will strike their heads with palms and fists."
5-13-33,"Vanaras loved by the famous king Sugreeva through good words, through small gifts, through respect will give up lives."
5-13-34,"Best among Vanaras will not enjoy together sport in forest, not on mountains, not again in covered places."
5-13-35,"Together with wife and children and together with ministers being tortured by grief of their lord, they will fall down from top of mountains on to flat lands and on to rugged lands."
5-13-36,"Vanaras will perform death by taking poison or getting hanged or entering fire or fasting or a weapon."
5-13-37,"While I am going I think about the destruction of Ikshvaaku dynasty and destruction of Vanaras and there will be a terrible wail."
5-13-38,"I will not go from here to the Kishkindha city. I am not capable to see Sugreeva without Seetha."
5-13-39,"I while not going, being here those virtuous ones, those great warriors those two Rama and Lakshmana will live by hope. Vanaras also who are agile will live."
5-13-40,"Without seeing Seetha subsisting on whatever falls on hand, whatever comes to mouth, being self restrained I will become a hermit living on trees and herbs at a region near ocean which has many roots, fruits and much water."
5-13-41,"Or I will enter fire which is glowing after making a funeral pile or while sitting performing fasting onto death my body will be eaten by crows and by beasts of prey."
5-13-42,"This way to giving up body has been seen by sages. This is my opinion if I do not see Seetha, I will enter lot of water."
5-13-43,"Not seeing Seetha, my garland of glory of long time with a strong foundation, beautiful one together with fame has been destroyed."
5-13-44,"I will become a hermit who is self restrained resorting to trees and herbs, I will not go from here not seeing Seetha with black eyes."
5-13-45,"If I go back from here without knowing that Seetha, there will not be Angada together with all those Vanaras."
5-13-46,"There are lots of blemishes in dying; one who is alive sees auspicious things. For that reason I will keep my life. It is definite for the meeting of people who are alive."
5-13-47,"Hanuma carrying in mind sorrow of various kinds again and again did not get then the crossing of sorrow."
5-13-48,"Otherwise I will kill Ravana with ten heads, with great prowess. Whatever happened to the stolen Seetha, this will be revenge to that."
5-13-49,"Otherwise carrying this Ravana over the surface of ocean I will take him to Rama like an animal to the lord of animals."
5-13-50,"Hanuma not seeing that Seetha thus begetting sorrow, thought with a mind cluttered with thoughts and sorrow."
5-13-51,"To wherever I see Seetha, the wife of Sri Rama and one with fame, till there I will search the city of Lanka again and again."
5-13-52,"Based on words of Sampati if I bring Sri Rama then Sri Rama not seeing wife will burn all Vanaras."
5-13-53,"With limited food and with restrained senses, I live here itself. By my deed those men and vanaras - let they not be destroyed."
5-13-54,"Whatever this Ashoka garden with great trees is being seen this I will obtain. This has not been searched by me."
5-13-55,"Saluting the eight Vasus, Rudras and Adityas, the two Aswinis, seven Maruts, I will go to increase the grief of Rakshasas."
5-13-56,"Defeating all rakshasas, I will give Seetha, who gives happiness to Ikshvaaku dynasty to Sri Rama as the fruit of austerity to an ascetic."
5-13-57,"The gloried son of Vayu that Hanuma got up with his senses tied by grief."
5-13-58,"Let there be salutations to Sri Rama together with Lakshmana, also to that, who is divine let there be salutations. To Rudra, Indra, Yama and Vaayu let there be salutations."
5-13-59,"That Hanuma saluting to all those and also to Sugreeva, observing all directions went towards Ashoka garden."
5-13-60,"The son of Vayu, that Vanara went by mind before itself toward that Ashoka garden. The auspicious one pondered the task to be done later."
5-13-61,"The Ashoka garden definitely will be with many rakshasas, filled with trees, adorned with various cultures and sacred."
5-13-62,"There definitely guards will be protecting assigned, trees, omnipresent Lord Vayu also will be blowing by without force, and by me this body has been made small for the sake of Sri Rama and to avoid Ravana."
5-13-63,"Devas together with ascetics will make success to me here, self born Brahma the divine one and devas and Agni and Vaayu, Devendra wearing the weapon of Vajra and Varuna with Pasha in hand and also the Sun and the moon and the aswinis. The great ones Maruts and Eshwara may give my success. Whoever is the lord of all living creatures among all living beings others who being unseen exist in the path may give success to me."
5-13-64,"When will I see that noble face with a high nose, with white teeth without any injuries with a bright smile, with eyes resembling lotus petals with sight equaling the splendor of clear full moon?"
5-13-65,"How that powerless Seetha, a helpless one, forcefully taken away by the mean vile Ravana with a cruel action, with a horribly decorated form will fall in the range of my sight today."
5-14-1,"That Hanuma with great resplendence thought for a moment, obtained that Ashoka garden by mind and jumped from the compound wall of that house."
5-14-2,"That great Hanuma with joyful limbs, being on enclosure wall saw various trees such as Sal, beautiful Ashoka, Champaka full of flowers, Uddalaka, Naga, mango trees with their fruit in the colour of the snout of a monkey, in full blossom at the start of the spring."
5-14-3,"Thereafter Hanuma flew like a Naracha arrow released from bow string, toward the garden covered by mango trees and surrounded by hundreds of creepers."
5-14-4,"That Hanuma the simian, saw on entering that garden filled with happy humans, animals and birds with varied hues during spring, resounded by birds, with trees made of silver, made of gold, surrounded everywhere by birds and groups of animals; wonderful with wonderful trees equaling the Sun at sunrise together with trees of various kinds which obtained flowers and fruits, served daily by Cuckoos and by dragon flies, resounded by peacocks in heat and with groups of birds of various kinds."
5-14-5,"Hanuma searching the royal daughter Seetha with excellent limbs and without blame, woke up birds in comfortable sleep."
5-14-6,"Trees hit by wings of groups of birds in flight shed showers of flowers of various colours and of various kinds."
5-14-7,"The son of Lord Vayu, Hanuma sprinkled with flowers shone like a mountain of flowers in the middle of Ashoka garden."
5-14-8,"Seeing Hanuma running in all directions and being in the middle of trees, all living creatures thought Him to be Vasanta, the lord of spring."
5-14-9,"There the Earth sprinkled by flowers of various kinds which fell down from trees shone like a well decorated woman."
5-14-10,"Then those trees, shaken by the might of Hanuma the mighty one, showered wonderful flowers."
5-14-11,"The trees with their branches, removed leaves with fallen down fruits and flowers were like defeated gamblers with their clothes and jewellery kept down."
5-14-12,"The excellent trees shining with best flowers fell down instantly flowers, leaves and fruits."
5-14-13,"All those trees losing groups of birds became being a resort to branches only like trees shook by wind."

5-15-33,"This is She for whose sake Rama tormented in four ways from compassion from pity from grief from love; (thinking that) a woman has disappeared from compassion, depending on him from pity, wife has been lost from grief, a dear one from love."
5-15-34,"In whatever way is this lady&#39;s appearance, elegance of major and minor limbs, in the same way is Rama&#39;s. In whatever way His appearance, in the same way is this black-eyed one&#39;s appearance."

5-26-6,"Or my this heart truly is made of iron. It is undecaying and without death. By what reason is it not destroying with sorrow?"
5-26-7,"Whoever I with a sinful life made to be without Rama, protecting life even for a moment, to such me who am ignoble, who am bad wife, shame on me."
5-26-8,"Without husband Rama who is the lord of the earth with ocean at the end, a pleasant talker, what is the interest to me in life or in comfort."

5-26-12,"Even if cut or if divided into parts in blazing fire, I will not reach Ravana. What is the use with your prattling for a long time?"
5-26-13,"Rama is famous, is a wise man, is compassionate with a good conduct. Due to the deterioration of my fortune, I doubt He became hard hearted."
5-26-14,"By whom alone fourteen thousand of ogres have been destroyed, why is that Rama not saving me."
5-26-15,"I am withheld by the ogre Ravana with little strength. My husband is indeed capable of killing Ravana in a war."
5-26-16,"By which Rama Viradha, best among ogres, has been killed in Dandaka forest in a war, why is that He not saving me?"
5-26-17,"This city of Lanka being in the middle of ocean is difficult to be attacked. But there will not be an obstacle to flying of Rama&#39;s arrows."
5-26-18,"What now is that reason by which Rama with a firm courage is not protecting His dear wife stolen by an ogre."
5-26-19,"I doubt that Rama elder to Laksmana does not know me to be here. After knowing will that glorious Rama tolerate this outrage?"
5-26-20,"Whoever Jatayu nearing Rama will have let known to Rama that Seetha was stolen, that king of vultures has been killed by Ravana in war."
5-26-21,"A great deed has been done by that Jatayu, thus protecting me, although of old age, standing in a dual combat with Ravana."
5-26-22,"If that Rama knows me to be living here, with anger He will make the world to be without ogres with His arrows now."
5-26-23,"Rama will blow away the city of Lanka, will dry up the great ocean, will destroy the name and fame of Ravana."
5-26-24,"Thereafter how I am crying in this way, in the same way, in very house, ogresses with killed husbands will cry again and again. There is no doubt in this."
5-26-25,"Rama together will Lakshmana will search the city of Lanka belonging to ogres. An enemy seen by those two will indeed not live even for a moment."
5-26-26,"This Lanka shortly will become like a graveyard, with paths agitated with smoke of funeral pyres, crowded with a group of vultures."
5-26-27,"In a short time only I will attain my desire. This evil course is telling of destruction of you all."
5-26-28,"Here in Lanka whatever inauspicious things are being seen, from those, in a short while Lanka will become deprived of glory."
5-26-29,"While the sinful, vile ogre Ravana is being killed, Lanka which is unconquerable till now, definitely will get drying up like a woman who lost husband."
5-26-30,"Now abounding in pious festivities, the city of Lanka with lost lord together with ogresses will become like a woman with lost husband."
5-26-31,"In a short while here in every house I can definitely hear the sound of ogresses crying being tormented by grief."
5-26-32,"The city of Lanka will become burnt by Rama&#39;s arrows together with darkness, with destroyed luster with killed best ogres."
5-26-33,"Will that Rama who is a strong man with red eye corners know me to be in the house of Ravana."
5-26-34,"Whatever time has been ordered by this cruel and vilest of men Ravana, this time has come to me. That death decreed to me does not hold good to this evil one (Ravana)."
5-26-35,"Whoever sinful ogres who do not know what should not be done, due to their unrighteousness now there will be a great calamity. These meat eating ogres do not know virtue."
5-26-36,"An ogre will definitely eat me for breakfast. What should such I do without Rama with pleasing appearance? I am grieving a lot not seeing Rama with red eye corners."
5-26-37,"Now if there exists any one who is a giver of poison here, I without husband quickly will see the god Yama."
5-26-38,"That Rama elder to Lakshmana may not know me to be alive. If those two know me to be alive, then it cannot be said that they will not do my search on earth."
5-26-39,"That valiant Rama who is the elder brother of Lakshmana due to grief of me, leaving the body on earth has gone to celestial world. This is certain."
5-26-40,"Whoever is seeing my husband Rama with eyes resembling a lotus flower such Devas, Siddhas together with Gandharvas and great sages are fortunate."
5-26-41,"Or to that Rama with a desire in virtuousness, who is intelligent, a sage-king, the supreme spirit, there is no use with me, his wife."
5-26-42,"Friendly disposition will occur in what is being seen. There is no friendship to one who does not see. Ungrateful ones destroy frindship. But Rama will not destroy friendship."
5-26-43,"I who is a woman who is perishing without the chief Rama to such me are there no good qualities or has my fortune diminished."
5-26-44,"To me who is deprived of Rama with untroubled reputation, a warrior, annihilator of enemies, a great soul, more than living, death is good."
5-26-45,"Or those two brothers who are best among men giving up weapons in the forest may have become dwellers of forest eating roots and fruits."
5-26-46,"Or Rama and Lakshmana the warrior brothers may have been killed by the evil soul king of ogres Ravana by deceit."
5-26-47,"Under such circumstances and time, such I in all ways am desiring to die. Even in this grief, death is not bestowed on me."
5-26-48,"Great souled ones with abandoned sins, with a conquered mind, those with great fortune, sages are indeed fortunate to whom there is no pleasure and displeasure."
5-26-49,"From pleasure sorrow and from displeasure great fear do not occur to great souls. Whoever are separated from pleasure and displeasure, my obeisance to such great souls."
5-26-50,"Left by dear Rama with a well known mind coming under the control of sinful Ravana, such I will leave breath of life."
5-27-1,"Thus spoken to by Seetha, ogresses swooned with anger terribly. Some went to tell that to Ravana the evil minded one."
5-27-2,"Therafter ogresses with a terrible appearance neared Seetha and ten agin spoke words of evil purpose, with a single meaning and which were harsh."
5-27-3,"O ignoble one! O one with a sinful resolve! O Seetha! Today at this moment ogreeses will eat this your flesh according to comfort."
5-27-4,"Then, seeing Seetha frightened by those evil ones, an ogress named Trijata, sleeping till then, spoke these words."
5-27-5,"O evil ones! Eat your selves. You will not eat Seetha who is the dear daughter of king Janaka and daughter-in-law of king Dasaratha."
5-27-6,"Now a dream which is terrible, causing the hairs to stand erect for the destruction of ogres and for the welfare of Her husband, has been seen by me."
5-27-7,"Thus spoken to by Trijata all ogresses were frightened and spoke to that Trijata these words."
5-27-8,"Of what kind is this dream seen by you. Tell us. Listening to this utterance that came forth from the mouths of those ogresses, Trijata spoke at that time this word relating to the dream."
5-27-9,"Rama wearing white garlands and clothes passing through the sky, Himself ascending a palanquin made of ivory tied with a thousand swans, arrived along with Lakshmana."
5-27-10,"Now it has been seen by me in the dream that Seetha also wearing white clothes was sitting on a white mountain surrounded by the ocean."
5-27-11,"Seetha came together with Rama like the light with the Sun. Rama also was seen by me to be mounted on a great elephant with four tusks and equalling a mountain and Rama wandered together with Lakshmana."
5-27-12,"Thereafter shining with their own radiance, wearing white garlands and clothes, those two best among men Rama and Laksmana neared Seetha."
5-27-13,"Thereafter Seetha rested on the upper part of back of elephant in the sky; taken by Her husband Rama to the front of that mountain."
5-27-14,"Thereafter it has been seen by me that Seetha with eyes like lotuses has risen up from the lap of Her husband and gently touched the Moon and the Sun with Her hand."
5-27-15,"Thereafter that best elephant ascended by those princes Rama and Lakshmana and by Seetha with wide eyes stood on the top of Lanka."
5-27-16,"Rama together with wife Seetha, Himself came here in a chariot tied with eight white bulls."
5-27-17,"The valorous best among men Rama together with brother Lakshmana and with Seetha ascended wonderful Pushpaka aeroplane equalling the Sun, went in the northern direction."
5-27-18,"Rama with strength equalling that of Lord Vishnu, born in Raghu&#39;s dynasty together with brother Lakshmana and with Seetha has been seen by me thus in the dream."
5-27-19,"Rama with great glory is not possible to be defeated by Suras or by ogres or by others like heaven not being conquerable by sinners."
5-27-20,"Ravana also was seen by me on earth sprinkled with oil, with red clothes, with garlands tied with Oleander flowers, drinking oil and intoxicated."
5-27-21,"Now Ravana fallen down on to earth from Pushpaka aeroplane having the head shaved, wearing black clothes again was seen to be pulled by a woman."
5-27-22,"Wearing red garlands and unguents, drinking oil, laughing, dancing, with a confused mind, with agitated senses, Ravana went by a chariot tied by donkeys."
5-27-23,"Undertaking southern direction, Ravana went quickly by a donkey.Again it was seen by me that the king of ogres Ravana stupefied with fear, fell down from the donkey with head down."
5-27-24,"That Ravana rising up quickly, together with perplexity, distressed with fear, excited by passion, being naked, like a mad man, prattling many bad words, entering dirt with a bad smell, which was intolerable, horrible, dark, like the hell and quickly sank in that."
5-27-25,"A woman with red clothes, who was black, with body smeared with dirt, tying Ravana by the throat, was pulling hiim in southern direction."
5-27-26,"In that dream the ogre Kumbhakarna has been seen thus by me. All Ravana&#39;s sons have been seen to be sprinkled with oil."
5-27-27,"Ravana by a pig, Indrajit by a porpoise, Kumbhakarna by a camel set out in southern direction."
5-27-28,"Among those Vibhishana is the only one who has been seen by me to be having a white umbrella, wearing white garlands and clothes and anointing body with white unguents."
5-27-29,"Vibhishana is there adorned with the sound of conch shells and kettledrums, with dances and songs, ascended a best elephant equalling a mountain with the sound of a thundering cloud, with four tusks. He approached the sky together with four ministers"
5-27-30,"An assembly also of ogres drinking oil and wearing red garlands, with red clothes, with the sound of songs and musical instruments has been seen by me."
5-27-31,"This beautiful city of Lanka has also been seen together with horses and elephants with broken gates and arches fallen down in the ocean."
5-27-32,"Lanka protected by Ravana has been seen by me in the dream to be burnt by a quick Vanara who is a messenger of Rama."
5-27-33,"In Lanka horrible with ash, all ogresses were drinking oil, laughing heartily with a great noise and also dancing a lot."
5-27-34,"All these best among ogres such as Kumbhakarna and others taking a red cloth entered a hole filled with cow dung."
5-27-35,"Go away! Be destroyed! Rama will get Seetha. With a great anger He will get you killed together with other ogres."
5-27-36,"Rama will not approve frightening ot threatening His dear wife who is highly valued by Him, who followed Him to live in the forest."
5-27-37,"For that reason, enough of cruel words. Gentle words indeed be said. Let us request Seetha. This is agreeable to me."
5-27-38,"Which woman while being sorrowful, such type of dream has been seen, that woman being released from various sorrows, will get unsurpassed pleasure."
5-27-39,"O ogresses! Entreat Seetha who has been frightened. What is the use with a desire to speak. From Rama a horrible fear has come to ogres."
5-27-40,"O ogresses! This Seetha daughter of Janaka, pleased with prostration is competent to protect us from great danger. And also I do not see in Her who is wide eyed, in Her limbs even a minute misshapen characteristic, even insignificant one."
5-27-41,"I see an imperfection in complexion alone. I doubt that this princess who came near an aeroplane in my dream, who is not suited to sorrows received sorrow."
5-27-42,"I am seeing Seetha coming near accomplishment of motive. I also see the destruction of Ravana also and victory of Rama coming near."
5-27-43,"Being a cause to listen to a great pleasure of Her, this throbbing eye long like a lotus petal is being seen my me."
5-27-44,"One left arm of this strightforward Seetha suddenly has become erect and is slightly trembling."
5-27-45,"Seetha&#39;s best left thigh equal to an elephant&#39;s trunk is trembling indicating Rama&#39;s standing in front of Her."
5-27-46,"A bird also entering its dwelling place on a branch again and again speaking best consolating words, is telling heartily welcoming words being delighted again and again, as though impelling Seetha."
5-28-1,"That Seetha, hearing those unpleasant words of Ravana, tormented by grief, was frightened like a tiny female-elephant overpowered by a lion in the middle of a forest."
5-28-2,"That fearful Seetha, who was situated in the middle of female-demons and also threatened by Ravana with his words galore, lamented (as follows) like a young virgin who was left lonely in the midst of a forest."
5-28-3,"Truly the saints affirm that untimely death does not come in the world, as I being impure am surviving even for an instant, though being threatened in this way."
5-28-4,"Though devoid of happiness and frequently full of sorrow, my heart must be hard indeed, in that it does not break into a thousand pieces today like a mountain-top struck by lightning."
5-28-5,"There is no fault of mine in this matter. I have become killable at the hands of this demon of disagreeable perception. I am not able to give him my affection any more than a member of the twice-born classes would offer a mystical verse to one not belonging to the twice-born classes."
5-28-6,"If Rama the Ruler of the world does not come here, the evil Ravana, the king of Demons will cut off my limbs with his sharpened weapons, even as a surgeon would cut the limbs of a lifeless feotus."
5-28-7,"To me lamenting, two months will go up to a long time, as at the end of a night a thief imprisoned and to be capitally punished under the detention orders of a king. Alas! This is painful."
5-28-8,"O Rama, O Lakshmana, O Sumitra, O Kausalya! O mother! I, of a scanty fortune, am going to be destroyed, like a ship driven out of its course by a strong wind in a mighty ocean."
5-28-9,"In the disguise of a deer, those two energetic sons of Dasaratha were surely killed for my sake, as two excellent lions killed by a flashing thunderbolt."
5-28-10,"Certainly that Time-spirit, assuming the guise of a deer, allured me, a woman of poor fortune at that time and to whom I, a stupid woman, sent forth (far away) Lakshmana and the noble prince Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana."
5-28-11,"O Rama, the strictly truthful man and the long-armed, O the man whose face resembles the full-moon! You, who are well-disposed of the world of living beings, do not indeed know me to have been sentenced to death by the demons."
5-28-12,"My not having a deity (other than my husband), this patience, my reposing on the floor, my restriction in righteousness, my devotion to the husband - all this has become a waste, like a good act done by men to ungrateful men becoming waste."
5-28-13,"For me who is not seeing you, who is bereft of you, who is not hopeful of coming into contact with you, who is emaciated and pale in complexion this righteous act performed by me has indeed become a waste. Likewise, this state of my being only one wife to you has become useless.."
5-28-14,"Having fulfilled your father&#39;s command as per the order of his words and observed your vow, you return from the forest fearlessly and having accomplished your purpose, I think you will enjoy carnally with large-eyed women."
5-28-15,"O Rama! Having performed austerity and vow in vain, I for myself who has fallen in love with you and in whose was confined an affection for you for a long time, for my own destruction, I can lose my life. Woe to me of my little fortune!"
5-28-16,"I as such will abandon quickly my life by poison or by a sharp weapon. To me, none is there, who is a giver either of a poison or of a sharp weapon in the house of Ravana."
5-28-17,"Thus lamenting in several ways, Seetha was recollecting Rama in all spirits and trembling with and emaciated face, approached that excellent tree in bloom."
5-28-18,"Seetha, who was tormented with grief, thus thinking in various ways and thereafter holding her braid of hair looking like a hanging rope (now thought within herself) I shall go to the presence of Yama the God of Death by tying my neck quickly with my braid of hair looking like a hanging rope"
5-28-19,"Thereafter Seetha with all her soft limbs stood seizing a branch of that tree. To her having handsome limbs, who was thinking of Rama, Lakshmana and her own race, then appeared many omens, which were not having adequate occasion for grief, which procured courage in the world, which were excellent and which were seen earlier also as thoroughly efficacious."
5-29-1,"To her who was in such circumstances, who was in distress, who was irraproachable, devoid of joy and dejected but virtuous, was bestowed with auspicious omens, as a prosperous man is bestowed with dependent servants."
5-29-2,"The beautifully haired Seetha&#39;s left eye, which was auspicious, whose surrounding row of eye-lashes were curved, which was black, wide and bright-looking; was predominantly quivering, like a red lotus quivered by the blow of a fish."
5-29-3,"Her left shoulder, which was pretty, distinguished beefy and round, which deserved to be applied with excellent black aloe and sandalwood paste, which had been used"
5-29-4,"Of her two thighs kept together, the left tigh which was beefy and well born, which resembled the trunk of a princely elephant was predominantly quivering, spoke indistinctly of existenc of Rama in front."
5-29-5,"Again, the clothing of Seetha standing there, of spotless eyes and charming limbs, having teeth resembling the buds of jasmine, which was of golden shade and was slightly soiled as it were with dust, glited down, which appeared auspicious (for her)."
5-29-6,"Bolstered by these and some other omens which straight explained that they were fruitful on the earlier occasion also, Seetha of beautiful eyebrows disclosed a great joy, even as a seed vanished and withered by the wind and the sun, got sprouted by rain."
5-29-7,"Moreover, having the lips resembling Bimba fruit, having beautiful eyes and eyebrows, whose eye lids are curved, having charming white teeth, her face shone like the moon liberated from the mouth of the demon Rahu."
5-29-8,"Free from sorrow, her weariness removed, her mental affliction alleviated and her consciousness awakened with exaltation, that esteemed lady (Seetha) looked handsome with her countenance, as a night with the moon appears during the bright fortnight."
5-30-1,"The valiant Hanuma also heard truly all those words of Seetha, Trijata and the threatening words of the female demons."
5-30-2,"Thereafter, seeing that Seetha as a divine lady in the garden of Nandana, Hanuma echoed his thought in various ways."
5-30-3,"Which Seetha is being searched in all directions by many thousands and myriads of monkeys, the same Seetha has been found by me."
5-30-4,"By me, employed thoughtfully (by my Master) as a secret agent and gone about secretly with a view to ascertain the enemy&#39;s strength, this has been perceived."
5-30-5,"The characteristics of demons, this town and the power of the king of demons, Ravana, have been perceived by me."
5-30-6,"It is proper for me to console the wife of Rama, desirous of seeing her husband who is compassionate towards all beings and who is of immeasurable might."
5-30-7,"I shall console this woman, whose face resembles a full moon, who is having an unforeseen affliction, who is tormented by grief and who is not attaining the end to her affliction."
5-30-8,"If I return without consoling this Seetha, the wife of Rama, even though her mind is tormented by grief, my departure becomes blemished."
5-30-9,"Not finding a rescue when I return to Kishkindha, the illustrious princess Seetha may give up her life."
5-30-10,"That long-armed Rama having the countenance of a full moon, eagerly longing to see Seetha, is fit to be consoled by me."
5-30-11,"It is not proper to speak with her within the sight of these female-demons. How indeed is this to be done? I am indeed perplexed."
5-30-12,"If she is not consoled by me during the rest of this night, she will forsake her life by all means. There is no doubt about it."
5-30-13,"If Rama enquires of me as to what words did Seetha speak about him, what can I say to Rama without speaking now to this Seetha, the slender-waisted lady?"
5-30-14,"To me returning in haste from here without carrying Seetha&#39;s message Rama may get irritated and burn me up with his pungent eyes."
5-30-15,"Even if I instigate my master Sugreeva to do his best in the cause of Rama, his arrival here with an army will be futile."
5-30-16,"Staying here itself and getting hold of an opportunity even in the midst of the female-demons (when they are in attentive), I shall slowly console Seetha who is very much in distress."
5-30-17,"However, I am very small in stature, particularly as a monkey and can speak now Sanskrit, the human language too."
5-30-18,"If I use Sanskrit language like a brahmin, Seetha will get frightened, thinking me as Ravana. Especially, how can a monkey speak it?"
5-30-19,"Certainly, meaningful words of a human being are to be spoken by me. Otherwise, the virtuous Seetha cannot be consoled."
5-30-20,"Looking at my figure and the language, Seetha who was already frightened previously by the demons, will get frightened again."
5-30-21,"Thereafter, this large-eyed Seetha who is full of mind, thinking me as Ravana who can assume any form at will, may shout loudly, engendered by fear."
5-30-22,"As soon as Seetha shouts loudly, a troop of female-demons, wielding various kinds of weapons and appearing dreadful as Yama the Lord of Death, may assemble here."
5-30-23,"Then those ugly faced female-demons may encircle me from all sides and try to catch and kill me with all their might."
5-30-24,"Then, seeing me running hither and thither, seizing big branches, twigs and trunks of excellent trees, they may get alarmed with fear."
5-30-25,"The ugly faced female-demons will be frightened with fear, after seeing my huge figure wandering in the grove."
5-30-26,"Then those female-demons may call the other demons too retained by Ravana in his house."
5-30-27,"Those female-demons with an element of turbulence and rapidity may rush into a battle with various kinds of weapons like spears lances and swords."
5-30-28,"Surrounded on all sides by them, I may not be able to reach the other shore of the great ocean, while destroying the army of demons."
5-30-29,"Or having jumped up (over me) many demons operating speedily may capture me. Then, Seetha may not be able to know the occurrence of my arrival. Even I may get captured too."
5-30-30,"Or the violent minded demons may kill this Seetha. Consequently this work of Rama and Sugreeva will be ruined."
5-30-31,"Seetha is residing in this secret place, with a concealed access, surrounded by demons and encircled by an ocean."
5-30-32,"If I am killed in the battle or got captured by the demons, I do not see any other companion for Rama who can fulfill this work (of searching for Seetha)."
5-30-33,"Even after due reflection, I do not see any monkey who can transgress the ocean with a breadth of one hundred Yojanas, in case I am killed."
5-30-34,"I am competent to kill even thousands of demons. I am quite sure. But, after doing such a large battle, I may not be capable of reaching the other shore of the ocean."
5-30-35,"&#39;Conflicts are unreal too and to me, there is no desire for uncertainty. which intellectual will do an assured act with an apprehension?"
5-30-36,"If I do not talk, there will be Seetha&#39;s death. If I talk to Seetha, this great lapse will occur."
5-30-37,"Actions which are going to be accomplished shortly, get spoiled at the hands of a accomplished shortly, get spoiled at the hands of a confused messenger, when the actions are set in opposition to time and space, even as darkness disappears at sun rise."
5-30-38,"Even if a decision is taken, regarding what is worthy and what is worthless, it does not yield good results. Messengers boasting themselves to be learned, thus indeed ruin those actions."
5-30-39,"How does not my work get spoiled? How should I avoid my feebleness? Also how does not my leaping across the sea become vain?"
5-30-40,"How can Seetha hear my words without fear? Thinking in this way, the wise Hanuma made up his mind (as follows):"
5-30-41,"If I eulogize Rama, who is unwearied in action and a good relation, I shall not frighten her, whose mind is directed towards that relation."
5-30-42,"Offering auspicious and righteous words about Rama the most excellent prince Ikshvaku dynasty who possesses a learned soul and myself speaking in a sweet voice, I shall make everything intelligible so that Seetha rightly believes everything."
5-30-43,"The noble-minded Hanuman, abiding in the midst of the twigs of the trees and seeing Seetha, spoke the following words of many kinds which were not futile."
5-31-1,"Thus reflecting on many kinds of thought, Hanuma spoke the following sweet words within the hearing range of Seetha."
5-31-2,"There was a king named Dasaratha who was very glorious among the kings of Ikshvaku dynasty and had a virtuous disposition. He owned chariots, elephants and horses, becoming very famous."
5-31-3,"He was excellent in virtues among royal sages. He was equal to the seven sages in austerity. He was born in the lineage of emperors and was equivalent to Indra in prowess."
5-31-4,"He was keen on harmlessness. He was not vulgar. He was compassionate. He was truly mighty. He was an eminent king in Ikshvaku race. He was endowed with prosperity and was causing to increase prosperity."
5-31-5,"The king Dasaratha was endowed with royal characteristics, highly prosperous, excellent among kings and highly prosperous, excellent among kings and famous on earth with its four borders. He was happy man and gave happiness to others."
5-31-6,"There was an eldest son named Rama to that Dasaratha. Rama was beloved having a moon-like face. He, knows the distinctions among humans and others. He was excellent among all the wielders of the bow."
5-31-7,"That Rama who annihilates enemies, is a protector of his own mode of life, a protector of his own people, a protector of every living being and a protector of righteousness."
5-31-8,"By the command of that Dasaratha, his old father and true-speaking man, that Rama a brave man went on exile to a forest along with his wife and brother."
5-31-9,"While hunting in that forest, that Rama killed many demons who were valiant and who could assume any form at will."
5-31-10,"Thereafter, hearing about the killing of demons in Janasthana, a part of Dandaka forest, in addition to killing of Khara and Dushana the demons, the enraged Ravana took away, Seetha, by deceiving Rama in creating an illusive image of deer in the forest."
5-31-11,"Searching for Seetha the irreproachable lady, that Rama met a monkey called Sugreeva as his friend in the forest."
5-31-12,"Thereafter, Rama the conqueror of enemy&#39;s cities and very strong man, killed Vali and gave away that kingdom of monkeys to Sugreeva."
5-31-13,"As commanded and sent by Sugreeva, thousands of monkeys capable of assuming form at their will, are searching for that lady Seetha in all quarters of the earth."
5-31-14,"By the words of Sampati, I a swift monkey crossed the ocean having a length of one hundred yojanas for the sake of this broad eyed Seetha."
5-31-15,"This Seetha has been found by me according to the same comeliness, complexion and the bodily marks as I had heard from Rama."
5-31-16,"Having spoken these words, Hanuma kept quiet. Hearing those words, Seetha too got a great surprise."
5-31-17,"Thereafter, that Seetha whose consciousness was enshrouded by affliction, whose hair-ends were curved and who was of a fearful nature, lifted her face and looked towards Shimshupa tree."
5-31-18,"Hearing Hanuma&#39;s words and looking at all quarters and sub-quarters, Seetha was recollecting Rama in all ways and obtained a great joy."
5-31-19,"Looking at sides, up and down, that Seetha saw that Hanuman, the sun of wind-god, having an unimaginable intelligence, the minister of Sugreeva and looking like the sun behind an eastern mountain."
5-32-1,"Then, seeing Hanuma, who was tawny coloured like a series of flashing thunderbolts wrapped up in a white cloth and hiding behind the branches of a tree, Seetha had her mind shaken."
5-32-2,"Seetha beheld there a monkey, beaming like a cluster of Ashoka flowers wide opened, with his eyes resembling regined gold, humble and speaking agreeable words."
5-32-3,"Seetha got a great surprise and thought (as follows): Alas! This monkey is hard to be approached, fearful and difficult to be looked at. Thus thinking, she was bewildered again."
5-32-4,"The splendid woman Seetha, bewildered by fear and afflicted with grief, lamented most piteously saying O, Rama! O, Rama! and O Lakshmana!. Seetha wept faintly in a low voice in many ways."
5-32-5,"Seeing that excellent monkey appraching humbly, that splendid woman Seetha thought it as a dream."
5-32-6,"Seetha, looking hither and thither, saw Hanuman, who was having a wide and curved mouth, doing acts as told by sugreeva the king of monkeys, the foremost of monkeys, greatly adored and the best among the inelligent."
5-32-7,"As soon as seeing Hanuma Seetha lost her consciousness very much and became seemingly lifeless. Regaining her consciousness after a long time the wide eyed Seetha moreover thought (as follows)"
5-32-8,"Today, I saw an ugly monkey in my dream, which is forbidden according to a body of scriptures. May it be well with Rama together with Lakshmana and with my father, King Janaka."
5-32-9,"This is not a dream. To me, tormented by sorrow and grief, there is indeed no sleep. To me, separated from Rama whose countenance resembles a full moon, there is no happiness indeed!"
5-32-10,"Since I am pondering with my mind about that Rama only, and always saying &#39;Rama! Rama!&#39; thus, confomably I am seeing and hearing a story thus corresponding to he same thought."
5-32-11,"Tormented as I am today by manmatha god of love longing for Rama, my whole feelings directed towards him and constantly thinking of him alone, in the like manner I am seeing him and in the like manner i am hearing of him alone."
5-32-12,"I am imagining that my wish will be fulfilled. Likewise, I am reasoning my wish by my intellect also. There is no concrete form indeed for my wish. He, with a well manifested form is speaking to me. for what reason?"
5-32-13,"My salutation to Brihaspati the Lord of eloquence, together with Indra the wielder of a thunderbolt, to Brahma the self-existent Lord and to the Lord of Fire eating the oblations! Let whatever words spoken by this monkey be true! Let them not be untrue!"
5-33-1,"That Hanuma, with coral-coloured face, very bright, the son of wind-god, wearing a humble and feeble look, approached Seetha by stepping down from the tree and offered her his salutation by keeping his joined palms on his head and spoke the following sweet words:"
5-33-2,"O Lady with your eyes resembling lotus leaves, wearing a worn out silken cloth! O, the irreproachable one! You have stood, holding by the hand a branch of the tree who are you?"
5-33-3,"Tears of sorrow are gushing down from your eyes, as water is scattered down from two lotus-petals. Why?"
5-33-4,"O auspicious lady! In whom are you born-whether in celestials or in ogres or in serpent-demons or in celestial musicians or in demons or in semi-divine beings or in mythical beings?"
5-33-5,"O lovely-faced woman! Who are you among eleven Rudras who bestow strength, or among Maruts the storm-gods or among eight Vasus the beneficent gods? O Handsome lady with fine hips! You appear to me as a deity."
5-33-6,"Are you Rohini, endowed with all the best qualities, fallen from heaven, left behind by moon and excellent among stars."
5-33-7,"O dark-eyed lady! Are you not the auspicious Arundhati, who irritated her husband, Vasishta the sage either by anger or by error?"
5-33-8,"O the slender waisted lady! You seem to be lamenting over someone who died is he your son, or father or brother or husband."
5-33-9,"You are lamenting. You are sighing a lot. You are touching the earth. You have royal insignia in you. According to these things, I do not consider you as a divine woman."
5-33-10,"Based on the marks on your person and your bodily characteristics, I believe you to be a queen of an emperor and the daughter of a king."
5-33-11,"If you are Seetha stolen per force by Ravana from Janasthana, tell it to me who is asking if you please!"
5-33-12,"According to your miserable state, the super-human beautiful figure and your costume endowed with austerity, surely you are Rama&#39;s wife."
5-33-13,"Hearing his words, Seetha was delighted of Rama&#39;s mention and spoke the following words to Hanuma, who was dwelling on a tree."
5-33-14,"I am the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha, eminent among the excellent kings on earth, who understands the nature of the spirit and who torments the army of the adversary."
5-33-15,"I am the daughter of the noble-natured Janaka, the king of Videha kingdom. I am know."
5-33-16,"I stayed in Rama&#39;s house there for twelve years, enjoying the worldly pleasures belonging to human kind and fulfilling all my desires."
5-33-17,"Thereafter, in the thirteenth year, King Dasaratha along with his preceptors started to perform anointment of the kingdom to Rama, a celebrity of Ikshvaku dynasty."
5-33-18,"While that anointment of Rama was being arranged, a queen called Kaikeyi spoke the following words to Dasaratha, her husband."
5-33-19,"If Rama gets anointed for the kingdom, from now onwards, I shall neither drink water nor take my food daily. This is the end to my life."
5-33-20,"O the excellent king! If that word of pledge was uttered affectionately by you and if it is not going to be a waste, let Rama go to the forest."
5-33-21,"Hearing the cruel and the disagreeable words of Kaikeyi and recollecting the boon given to the queen, King Dasaratha who was true to his word, fell unconscious."
5-33-22,"Then, the aged king, who was firmly established in truth and righteousness, regretfully asked his illustrious eldest son to give back the kingdom, which he bestowed him earlier."
5-33-23,"That glorious Rama first admitted his father&#39;s words in mind, considering them more dearer than his anointment to the kingdom and accepted them with his word."
5-33-24,"The truly courageous Rama always gives anything to others and does not take anything from others. He does not speak just a little of a disagreeable word even for the cause of his life."
5-33-25,"Leaving behind his greatly valuable outer garments and wearing garments made of bark, that highly illustrious Rama gave up his kingdom willingly and assigned me to his mother."
5-33-26,"To me bereft of him, residing even in heaven does not indeed give pleasure. I, as such, decided to proceed to the forest and soon was ready to start even ahead of Rama."
5-33-27,"Adorned with clothes of bark, the illustrious Lakshmana, the rejoice of his friends, got ready to follow his elder brother even before (me)."
5-33-28,"Obeying respectfully the command of Lord Dasaratha, we as such with a firm resolution, entered the forest, which we have never seen before and which was deep and profound in appearance."
5-33-29,"While Rama of great vigour was dwelling in the forest of Dandaka, the evil-minded demon, Ravana took me, Rama&#39;s wife, away."
5-33-30,"A period of two months of survival-benefit has been given to me by him. For that reason, after the said two months, I shall give up my life."
5-34-1,"Hearing those words of Seetha who was overthrown from one grief to another, Hanuma the best of monkeys gave the following reply in a kindly and affectionate manner."
5-34-2,"O Seetha the daughter of the king of Videha Kingdom! I have come here as your messenger on Rama&#39;s directions. The virtuous Rama enquired about your welfare too."
5-34-3,"O Divine Lady! Rama the son of Dasaratha, who is excellent among the knowers of Veda and who knows Brahma&#39;s missile (a mythical weapon which deals infallible destruction) and Vedas the sacred knowledge, enquired about your welfare."
5-34-4,"Also the greatly splendourous Lakshmana, the favourite brother and the follower of your husband, himself tormented with grief, performed salutation to you by bowing his head."
5-34-5,"Hearing that news of welfare of Rama and Lakshmana the excellent of men, the divine lady, with all her limbs thrilled with joy, spoke to Hanuma (as follows):"
5-34-6," &#39;Joy rushes to surviving man even though (it be) as the end of a hundred years&#39; - this popular adage appears true and and auspicious for me."
5-34-7,"Seetha showed wonderful friendly disposition towards Hanuma who approached her. Both of them also conversed with each other in full confidence."
5-34-8,"Hearing that reply of Seetha who was afflicted with grief, Hanuma the army-chief of monkeys endeavoured to draw nearer to her."
5-34-9,"In as much as that Hanuma drew nearer to her, in the same way, that Seetha suspected him as Ravana."
5-34-10,"O shame! It was my guilt to tell him all this to him. He is indeed that Ravana, who obtained another guise."
5-34-11,"That Seetha, having faultless limbs, leaving that branch of Ashoka tree and as emaciated with grief, sat down on that ground itself."
5-34-12,"Seeing Seetha afflicted with grief and deluded with fear, the great armed Hanuma also then simply saluted her. She too, trembling with fear, did not look towards him again."
5-34-13,"Seetha, with her countenance resembling the moon, seeing Hanuma saluting her, had a deep sigh and spoke to Hanuma in a sweet-sounding voice (as follows)"
5-34-14,"If you are Ravana, who made use of an illusive guise and yourself a conjurer, you are causing me a further agony. It is no good."
5-34-15,"&#39;You are indeed the same Ravana, who, abandoning your real form, appeared to me in the guise of a vagrant religious mendicant in Janasthana."
5-34-16,"O demon who can assume any form at your will! It is no good that again you are causing agony to me, emaciated because of fasting and feeling very miserable."
5-34-17,"Otherwise, whatever is suspected by me is not indeed true because in my mind, a pleasurable sensation indeed occurred by reason of your audience."
5-34-18,"If you have come as Rama&#39;s messenger, may you be blessed! O the best of monkeys! Rama&#39;s anecdote is very pleasurable for me. Hence, I am requesting you to narrate it."
5-34-19,"O monkey! Narrate the qualities of my beloved Rama. O gentle one! You are eroding my mind as a rapid course of stream erodes a river bank."
5-34-20,"I, who was taken away long ago, is seeing a monkey sent by Rama in this way. Alas! How delightful this dream is!&#39;"
5-34-21,"If I have seen the eminent Rama together with Lakshmana, I would not have disheartened. In my case, even my dream is wicked!"
5-34-22,"I do not deem it as a dream. Seeing a monkey in a dream does not bring about prosperity But prosperity has come to me!"
5-34-23,"How possibly is it a delusion of my mind? Is it an impending course of flatulence or changing mental condition of madness? Is it a looming mirage?"
5-34-24,"Otherwise, it is neither madness nor even a delusion, which is a symptom of madness. Because I am knowing about myself as also about this monkey."
5-34-25,"Thus deliberating upon the strengths and weaknesses in several ways, Seetha finally imagined him to be Ravana, as demons can change their forms at will."
5-34-26,"Then, that slender waisted Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, thus having made up her mind, did not reply in return anything further to Hanuman."
5-34-27,"Understanding the contemplation of Seetha, Hanuma the son of wind-god then brought about a great joy in her with his words most favourable to her ears (as follows):"
5-34-28,"Rama has a great splendour like that of the sun. He is pleasing to all like the moon. As Kubera the Lord of wealth, he is a lord to the entire world. Like Vishnu, he is greatly renowned and endowed with valour."
5-34-29,"Rama is a speaker of truth. Like Lord Brihaspati, he has a sweet voice. He is a handsome man, possessing good fortune and a royal dignity. He is a personified Manmadha, the lord of love."
5-34-30,"Rama gets anger only at right time. He strikes a befitting person at a right time. He is an excellent chariot-warrior. The world is resting under the shelter of arms of this high souled man."
5-34-31,"Showing an illusory antelope, Ravana detracted Rama and took you away from a deserted hermitage. You will see later, the consequence Ravana will get for this act."
5-34-32,"Which valiant Rama with arrows strongly shining like sparkles released with anger, by the same Rama I was sent here as a messenger and I arrived at your presence. That Rama, agonised by your separation wishes to enquire of your welfare."
5-34-33,"That long-armed Lakshmana too, having a great splendour and who augments the happiness of Sumitra his mother, saluted you and enquired about your welfare."
5-34-34,"O princess! That monkey called Sugreeva, a companion of Rama and the king of the excellent monkeys, asked about your welfare."
5-34-35,"Rama, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana, is always recollecting you. O Seetha! Eventhough coming into the control female-demons, you are somehow surviving by your good luck!"
5-34-36,"Within a few days, you will see Rama, the mighty Lakshmana and the highly splendorous Sugreeva, in the presence of crores of monkeys."
5-34-37,"I am a monkey, the minister of Sugreeva, called Hanuma. I entered the city of Lanka, by traversing the great ocean."
5-34-38,"Asserting my strength and putting down my feet on the head of the evil minded Ravana, I have come to see you."
5-34-39,"O Princess! I am not so, as you comprehend me (as Ravana). Let your suspicion be given up. Believe me as I say it."
5-35-1,"Hearing that narration about Rama from Hanuma the excellent of monkeys, Seetha in a sweet voice spoke the following gentle words:"
5-35-2,"Where was your contact with Rama? How do you know Lakshmana? How did the union between monkeys and men arise?"
5-35-3,"O Hanuma! What are the characteristics of Rama and Lakshmana? Narrate them to me, so that sorrow will not take possession of me again."
5-35-4,"Of what kind was the appearance of that Rama and of Lakshmana? Of what kind was their form? How were the thighs? How were the arms? Tell me."
5-35-5,"Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma, the son of wind-god, then started to describe Rama according to his actual state (as follows):"
5-35-6,"O Seetha having eyes resembling lotus leaves! By my fortune, you are enquiring about the appearance of Rama your husband and Lakshmana, eventhough you know about them. Alas! what a pleasure!"
5-35-7,"O the large eyed Seetha! I tell the characteristics of Rama and Lakshmana as I recognized them; hear them from me."
5-35-8,"O Seetha the daughter of Janaka! Rama has his eyes resembling the petals of a lotus. He has a handsomeness, attracting the hearts of all living beings. He is endowed with grace and dexterity, by birth."
5-35-9,"He is equal to the sun in splendour, earth in endurance, Brihaspati in intelligence and Indra in fame."
5-35-10,"Rama the tormentator of his adversaries, is a protector of the world of beings, further protecting his own people. He is the protector of his own behaviour and righteousness."
5-35-11,"O Seetha! Rama is the protector of the four castes of the world. He is the doer and also the agent for the people&#39;s propriety of conduct."
5-35-12,"Rama is a resplendent man. He is respected exceedingly. He is established in a vow of chastity. He knows how to do good to virtuous people. He knows the application and advantage of his actions."
5-35-13,"He is well trained in statesmanship. He honours brahmins, the priestly class. He possesses sacred knowledge. He is endowed with good conduct. He is a modest man. He torments his adversaries."
5-35-14,"He got trained in Yajurveda, the sacrificial Veda. He is highly honoured by those well-versed in Vedas. He is skilled in Dhanurveda, the science of archery, other Vedas and the six limbs* of Vedangas."
5-35-15,"O princess! Rama is a broad shouldered and a long-armed man. He has a shell-like neck. He has a handsome countenance. He has a hidden collar-bone. He has beautiful red eyes. His fame is heard about by people."
5-35-16,"He has a voice like the sound of a kettle-drum. He has a shining skin. He is full of splendour. He is square-built. His limbs are built symmetrically. He is endowed with a dark-brown complexion."
5-35-17,"He is ever firm in three limbs (viz. the breast, waist and fist), long in three (viz. the breast, waist and fist), long in three (viz. the eyebrows, arms and soles), uniform in three (viz. his locks, testical and knees, elevated in three (viz. his breast, rim of his navel and lower abdomen), coppery in three of the navel and the lower abdomen), coppery in three (viz. the rims of his eyes, nails, palms and soles), soft in three (viz. the lines on his soles, hair and the end of the membrane virile) and always deep in three (viz. the voice, gait and the navel)."
5-35-18,"He has three folds in the skin of his neck and belly. He is depressed at three places (viz. the middle of his soles, the lines on his soles and the nipples). He is undersized at four places (viz. the neck, membran virile, the back and the shanks). He is endowed with three spirals in the hair of his head. He has four lines at the root of his thumb (denoting his proficiency in the four Vedas). He has four lines on his forehead (indicating longevity). He is four cubits high (96 inches). He has four pairs of limbs (viz. the cheeks, arms, shanks and knees) equally matched."
5-35-19,"He has fourteen other pairs of limbs (viz. the eye brows, nostrils, eyes, ears, lips, nipples, elbows, wrists, knees testicles, lions, hands, feet and thighs) equally matched. The four large teeth at both the ends of his upper and lower jaws are very sharp. He walks in four gaits (resembling the walks of a lion, a tiger, an elephant and a bull). He is endowed with excellent lips, chin and nose. He has five glossy limbs (viz. the hair, eyes, teeth, skin and soles). He has eight long limbs (viz. the arms, fingers and toes, eyes and ears, thighs and shanks)."
5-35-20,"Rama has ten lotus-like limbs (viz. the countenance, the mouth, the eyes, the tongue, lips, palate, breasts, nails, the hands and the feet). He has ten ample limbs (viz. the chest, the head, the forehead, the neck, the arms, the heart, the mouth the feet, the back and the ears).

He pursues religious merit, worldly riches and the sensuous delight in three periods (viz. the forenoon, midday and afternoon)."
5-35-21,"Rama is engrossed in truth and righteousness. He is a prosperous man. He is interested in reception and facilitation. He knows how to apportion place and time. He speaks affectionately with all."
5-35-22,"The invincible Lakshmana, the son of Rama&#39;s step-mother and Rama&#39;s brother, is resembling Rama in appearance, affection and in qualities."
5-35-23,"Rama and Lakshmana, the two tigers among men, very anxiously desirous of seeing you and searching all over the earth, came in contact with us."
5-35-24,"Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, wandering only in search of you all over the earth, saw Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys, sitting on the top of Rishyamuka mountain, filled with several trees, having been dethroned by his elder brother, oppressed with fear, but who was pleasant to the sight."
5-35-25,"We for one are serving that Sugreeva, the Lord of monkeys, who was true to his promise, but was dethroned from the kingdom from his elder brother."
5-35-26,"In the meanwhile, those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, wearing clothes made of bark and arming the best bows, came to the charming place of Rishyamuka mountain."
5-35-27,"Seeing Rama and Lakshmana, the excellent of men, coming with bows in hand, that Sugreeva the best of monkeys was deluded with fear and jumped over to the hill-top of that mountain."
5-35-28,"Thereafter, stationed on that hill-top, that Sugreeva the lord of monkeys, very soon sent me only, to approach those two brothers."
5-35-29,"On that command of Sugreeva, I reached saluting those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana the excellent and capable men, endowed with good form and characteristics."
5-35-30,"Those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, the excellent among men, were fully endowed with kindness, after knowing the exact position about Sugreeva. Then, I made Rama and Lakshmana to ascend on my back and took them to Sugreeva&#39;s place."
5-35-31,"I informed the high-souled Sugreeva about the true position of Rama and Lakshmana. After a mutual conversation between those two brothers and Sugreeva, a great friendship developed among them."
5-35-32,"Thus endowed with friendship, Sugreeva the lord of monkeys and Rama the best of men, by talking together of their earlier occurrences, developed mutual confidence."
5-35-33,"Thereafter, that Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana, through the extremely effulgent Vali the brother of Sugreeva, consoled Sugreeva who was earlier expelled from the kingdom; (by Vali), for the sake of Ruma a woman."
5-35-34,"Then, Lakshmana informed Sugreeva the king of monkeys about the sadness of Rama, (who is unwearied in action), born out of your disappearance."
5-35-35,"Hearing the words of Lakshmana, Sugreeva then became highly dim-witted, as the sun becomes dim when overpowered by an eclipse."
5-35-36,"Thereafter, all those multitude of ornaments which adorned your body, which were being tried to be be snatched away by Ravana and which were dropped on to the earth, were brought by monkey-leaders joyfully and shown to Rama. But the monkey-leaders did not know the further course of your movement."
5-35-37,"I indeed brought those ornaments near to Rama and gave them to him. Then, soon after receiving them, Rama lost his consciousness and the resounding ornaments were scattered all over."
5-35-38,"That Lord Rama looking like god, kept those beautiful ornaments of yours in his flank and lamented in many ways."
5-35-39,"While seeing those ornaments, Rama was lamenting and getting suffocated again and again. Thus, those ornaments ignited the fire of Rama&#39;s grief."
5-35-40,"That grief-stricken mighty man was thus lying on the floor for a long time. Then, with great difficulty, I made him to get up by telling several consoling words."
5-35-41,"That long-armed Rama, along with Lakshmana, after seeing those ornaments, examined them, again and again. He later gave them to Sugreeva."
5-35-42,"O the kind mistress! As you were being unseen, Rama was tormented forever with a great flaming fire of grief, like a volcano."
5-35-43,"For your sake, insomnia, grief and worry were tormenting that great souled Rama, as flames torment a burning house."
5-35-44,"By the grief caused by your not being seen, Rama is trembled with grief, as a high mountain is trembled by a great earthquake."
5-35-45,"O princess! In not seeing you, Rama is not obtaining delight, even while moving in quite charming forests, encompassing rivers and water-falls."
5-35-46,"O Seetha the daughter of Janaka! That Rama the excellent of men will receive you, soon after, killing Ravana along with Ravana&#39;s friends and relatives."
5-35-47,"That day when Rama and Sugreeva were together, both of them made an agreement that Rama would annihilate Vali and Sugreeva would arrange for a search of you."
5-35-48,"Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana the two valiant princes reached Kishkindha. Rama killed Vali the king of monkeys there in a combat."
5-35-49,"After killing Vali in combat by means of his strength, Rama made Sugreeva the king for the entire multitude of bears and monkeys."
5-35-50,"O princess! A friendship was held well in such a manner between Rama and Sugreeva. Know me as Hanuma, who came here as a messenger on behalf of both of them."
5-35-51,"Having got his own kingdom, Sugreeva summoned for mighty as well as capable monkeys and sent them to ten different directions in search of you."
5-35-52,"As commanded by Sugreeva of a great splendour and the king of monkeys, those monkeys resembling Himalayan mountains, started out on all directions of the earth."
5-35-53,"Then, we along with other monkeys too who are eager to fulfill the command of Sugreeva, are wandering the entire earth in search of you."
5-35-54,"An excellent monkey named Angada, possessed of fortune, son of Vali and having great strength, taking one third of army along with him, set out in search of you."
5-35-55,"A number of days and nights passed, filled as we were with grief, having got lost our way intensely in a mountain-range called Vindhya."
5-35-56,"We were determined to forsake our lives because of despair in our non-fulfillment of work, in our overstepping of time-limit given by Sugreeva and in fear of the King Sugreeva."
5-35-57,"Having searched in places difficult of access in forests, at mountains and at cascades and not obtaining any indication of you the princess, we were ready to give up our lives."
5-35-58,"O Seetha! Seeing all the excellent monkeys sitting down and calmly awaiting for the approach of death, Angada was very much immerssed in the ocean of sorrow and lamented about your loss, the killing of Vali, the death of Jatayu and our practice of calmly awaiting for the approach of death in simply sitting down."
5-35-59,"For us who lost all our hopes on our lives and willing to give up our lives as per the command of Sugreeva, as though for the sake of our need alone, a great valiant bird came there."
5-35-60,"Hearing about the killing of his brother, the vulture-king Sampati the brother of slain Jatayu the King of vultures spoke (the following) words in anger:"
5-35-61,"O the best of monkeys! Tell me who, where and how my younger brother Jabali was killed and made to fall."
5-35-62,"Then, Angada told Sampati a detailed account of events which led tot he killing of that great bird at Janasthana, by a demon of terrific form, for your sake."
5-35-63,"O Seetha with an excellent waist! Hearing about the slaughter of Jatayu, that Sampati the son of Aruna was very much pained and said that you were staying in Ravana&#39;s house."
5-35-64,"Hearing those delightful words of Sampati, we with our Chief Angada started soon from there."
5-35-65,"The monkeys were very much delighted and satisfied. They were making up their energy to see you, rose up from Vindhya mountain and reached the northern shore of the ocean."
5-35-66,"All the monkeys with their Chief Angada, in their anxiety to see you, reached the ocean. They were frightened after seeing the ocean there and they were again worried."
5-35-67,"Thereafter, seeing the ocean, I removed the serious fears of the army of monkeys who were worrying and crossed hundred Yojanas across the sea."
5-35-68,"Entering even Lanka, filled with demons in the night, I saw Ravana and you too who were immersed in grief."
5-35-69,"O the faultless princess! I told you all this as actually occurred. I am the messenger of Rama. Talk to me."
5-35-70,"O princess! I made an effort on Rama&#39;s behalf and came here for your sake. I am Sugreeva&#39;s minister. I am the son of wind-god. Know me, as such."
5-35-71,"You Rama, the excellent man among all the wielders of bow, is safe. Lakshmana, who is engaged in the service of his elder brother and possessing good characteristics, is also safe."
5-35-72,"O princess! I, who am interested in the welfare of the valiant Rama, your husband, came here alone on the command of Sugreeva."
5-35-73,"I, who can change my form at will, desirous of finding out your access, wandering alone without any helper, came to this southern direction."
5-35-74,"I shall remove the anguish of the army of monkeys who are lamenting because of your disappearance by informing them about my coming close to you because of my good fortune!"
5-35-75,"O princess! By my fortune, my crossing of ocean has not gone in vain. I can get this fame of having seen you because of my good luck."
5-35-76,"The highly valiant Rama, by killing Ravana the Lord of demons along with his friends and relatives, will obtain you soon."
5-35-77,"O Seetha! There is a mountain called Malyavan, which is the best among mountains. From there, a monkeys called Kesari went to another mountain called Gokarna."
5-35-78,"As prayed by gods and seers, that great monkey called Kesari, my father killed a demon named Shambasadana at a sacred shrine near the sea-shore."
5-35-79,"O Seetha! I am born in the womb of the wife of that Kesari the monkey, by the grace of the wind-god. By my activity alone, I am renowned as Hanuma in this world."
5-35-80,"O Seetha! I described the qualities of Rama, your husband, to cause trust in you. O the faultless princess! Rama will take you from here within a short time."
5-35-81,"Thus inspired by confidence because of the above reasons, Seetha emaciated with grief, by adequate clues served as proof."
5-35-82,"Seetha obtained unequal delight. She released tears of joy from her eyes having curved eye-lashes, with a thrill of delight."
5-35-83,"The countenance of that large-eyed Seetha, who is beautiful, whose eyes are red white and long is shining like a moon, the king of stars liberated from Rahu the demon."
5-35-84,"Seetha considered Hanuma clearly as a monkey and not otherwise. Thereafter Hanuma replied to her who is pleasant to the sight (as follows)"
5-35-85,"O Seetha! I told you indeed all this please be consoled. Tell me what I can do for you and also what is agreeable to you. I am going back now."
5-35-86,"O Seetha! As provoked by the sages, Kesari, the valiant monkey killed a demon called Shambasadana in battle. I am a monkey born through wind-god and through his influence I am equal to the wind-god in strength."
5-36-1,"Hanuma, the highly energetic son of wind-god, with an inducement to obtain confidence from Seetha, again modestly spoke the following words:"
5-36-2,"O illustrious lady! I am a monkey and a messenger of the wise Rama. O princess! Look at this ring too, marked with Rama&#39;s name."
5-36-3,"I brought this ring given by the high souled Rama, for the purpose of gaining your confidence. Get consoled indeed. Happiness to you! You are now free from the object of your grief."
5-36-4,"I brought this ring given by the high souled Rama, for the purpose of gaining your confidence. Get consoled indeed. Happiness to you! You are now free from the object of your grief."
5-36-5,"The countenance of that large-eyed Seetha, which appeared charming with red and white eyes shone like a moon the king of stars liberated by Rahu the demon. Then, that young Seetha, gladdened by the message of her husband, became shy and message of her husband, became shy and well-pleased. Uttering delightful words, she praised Hanuma the great monkey (as follows):"
5-36-6,"O Hanuma the best of monkeys! You have singly overpowered this place infested by demons. You are valiant. You are competent. You are intelligent."
5-36-7,"You, with an acclaimable gallantry, crossed the ocean having a width of one hundred Yojanas and an asylum of crocodiles, making it as a small puddle."
5-36-8,"O excellent of monkeys! For you there is no fear nor even bewilderment from Ravana. Hence, I do not consider you as an ordinary monkey."
5-36-9,"O the best of monkeys! If you are sent by that Rama, who knows the nature of his self, you are worthy of talking to me well."
5-36-10,"The indomitable Rama must not have sent you indeed, especially to me, without knowing your enterprise and without testing you in advance."
5-36-11,"Rama the righteous man who is true to his promise and Lakshmana of great splendour who enriches the joy of Sumitra are fortunately safe."
5-36-12,"If Rama is safe, with his anger why is he not scorching the earth with ocean as its belt, like rising fire at the end of the world?"
5-36-13,"Otherwise, Rama and Lakshmana are capable of holding down even the celestials. But I think there is no end indeed to my troubles."
5-36-14,"Is not Rama getting perturbed? Is he not tormented with grief? Is Rama the best of men now doing the right acts to annihilate the enemies?"
5-36-15,"Is Rama the prince miserable and confused? Is he even mistaken in his actions? I hope he is doing all acts which require human effort."
5-36-16,"Is Rama the annihilator of enemies as per necessity resorting to the two strategies viz., conciliatory and partaking approaches and even the three strategies viz., partaking, sowing dissension and open assault? Is he kind-hearted towards friends, with a wish to conquer the enemies?"
5-36-17,"Is he getting friends? Has he been approached for friendship by others? I hope he is having good friends and even so honoured by them."
5-36-18,"Is Rama the prince wishing the grace of the gods? Is he equally aware of the role of human endeavour and the role of fate?"
5-36-19,"O Hanuma! Is Rama not losing affection in me because of my staying away from home? Will he release me from this evil predicament?"
5-36-20,"Is Rama, who is habituated always to pleasures and not habituated to pains, not sinking into despondency by now getting this great pain?"
5-36-21,"Are you constantly hearing the news of safety of Kausalya, Sumitra and Bharata?"
5-36-22,"Is Rama worthy of honour, suffering from pain just because of me? Will he liberate me from my sorrow, without fixing his mind on something else?"
5-36-23,"I hope Bharata, having a brotherly affection, will send for my sake, an army furnished with banners, guarded by the ministers, consisting of ten anikinis (21870 elephants, 21870 chariots, 65610 horses and 109350 foot soldiers) which were terrific in appearance."
5-36-24,"The glorious Sugreeva the lord of monkeys will indeed come for my sake along with his valiant monkeys, who have their tusks and nails as their weapons."
5-36-25,"Lakshmana, the strong man, who augments the joy of Sumitra and who is an expert in weaponry, will indeed destroy the demons by the multitude of his arrows."
5-36-26,"Within a short time, I hope see Ravana killed along with his companions in the battle-field by terrific weapons burning brightly."
5-36-27,"That face of Rama with its golden and with the fragrance of a lotus may be looking miserable as bereft of me and getting dehydrated too. I hope it is not parched by the sun, like a louts."
5-36-28,"Which Rama left the kingdom as an indication of his righteousness and to whom there was neither disturbance nor fear nor sorrow even while taking me to the forest by foot, I hope that the same Rama is maintaining boldness in his heart."
5-36-29,"To Rama, in the matter of affection, neither his mother nor his father nor any body else is equal to or more than me. O Hanuma the messenger! I wish to survive only as long as I hear the activity of my beloved."
5-36-30,"Uttering thus those greatly meaningful and sweetly worthwhile words, Seetha the princess further abstained from talking so as to hear Hanuma&#39;s delightful words describing the matters pertaining to Rama."
5-36-31,"Hearing Seetha&#39;s words, Hanuma of terrific prowess, keeping his joined palms on his head, spoke the following words in reply."
5-36-32,"O Seetha having lotus eyes! Rama does not know that you are here. For that reason, he did not take you back soon, as Indra the destroyer of strong holds did not take back Sachi, his wife."
5-36-33,"Soon after hearing my words, Rama will come soon, drawing forth a large army, consisting of a multitude of monkeys and bears."
5-36-34,"Rama will paralyze the imperturbable ocean with his flood of arrows and make the City of Lanka extinguished of demons."
5-36-35,"If the goddess of Death along with demons or celestials stand firmly in the way of Rama at that time, he will kill them also."
5-36-36,"O noble lady! Being full of grief caused by your non-appearance, that Rama is not obtaining happiness, like an elephant tornmented by a lion."
5-36-37,"O Seetha the princess! I swear and tell you by the mountains Malaya, Vindhya, Meru and Dardura as well as by our staple food of roots and fruits, that you will soon see Rama&#39;s face, having good eyes, handsome, having lips with the colour of a bright-red gourd (fruit of Momordica monodelpha) and with its charming look like a rising full moon."
5-36-38,"O Seetha! You will see soon Rama on the Prasravana mountain, like Indra the Lord of celestials seated on the back of Airavata, the chief of elephants."
5-36-39,"Rama is not eating meat, nor indulging even in spirituous liquor. Everyday, in the evening, he is eating the food existing in the forest, well arranged for him."
5-36-40,"With his mind wholly devoted to you, Rama is not even driving away forest-flies from his body, nor mosquitoes nor insects nor reptiles from his body."
5-36-41,"Rama always cogitates on something or the other. He is forever engaged in sorrow. He is enamoured with the god of love and thinks of nothing else."
5-36-42,"Rama mostly does not have sleep. Even if that best of men sleeps, he keeps awake uttering sweet words like lo! Behold! Seetha!"
5-36-43,"When he happens to see a fruit or a flower or any other beautiful object, he recollects of you and says &#39;O beloved!&#39; many times and breathes a sigh."
5-36-44,"O Seetha the princess! Rama the magnanimous prince is always lamenting, speaking just about you, recollecting Seetha, Seetha!. Being firm in his vow, he makes effort to find you only."
5-36-45,"That Seetha, who has the same amount of grief as that of Rama, became worn out of her grief upon hearing the adoration of Rama, like a night with the moon obscured by the remnant clouds at the commencement of autumn."
5-37-1,"Hearing Hanuma&#39;s words, Seetha whose face resembled the full moon, spoke the following words braced with justice and utility, to Hanuma."
5-37-2,"O Hanuma! The words spoken by you viz. that Rama is not having any other thoughts (than on me) and is fully overwhelmed by sorrow are like ambrosia mixed with poisons."
5-37-3,"Destiny drags out a man into a very extensive fortune or into a very dreadful adversity, as if being dragged, tied with ropes."
5-37-4,"O Hanuma the best of monkeys! For living beings, destiny is surely irresistible. See how Lakshmana, myself and Rama are baffled by misfortunes."
5-37-5,"When will Rama reach the end of this grief any more than a thoroughly fatigued man, having suffered a ship wreck is swimming in the middle of the sea?"
5-37-6,"When will my husband see me, after annihilation of the demons, killing of Ravana and making the City of Lanka debacled?."
5-37-7,"Till the current period of one year is not completed, that Rama is to be told to make haste to save me; since my life will be lasting till such time only."
5-37-8,"O Hanuma! Out of the time-limit given to me by the cruel Ravana for my survival, the tenth month is now running. Only two months are left out."
5-37-9,"Even when humbly entreated with continued exertion by Vibhishana his brother about my restoration (to Rama), Ravana is not making up his mind to do so."
5-37-10,"My restoration is not agreeable to Ravana. In the battle, death lies in wait for Ravana, who has become subject to the power of Time."
5-37-11,"O Hanuma! Nala, the eldest maiden daughter of Vibhishana, when she was sent personally to me by her mother, told me about this."
5-37-12,"O Hanuma the excellent of monkeys! Rama, my husband, will soon regain me without any doubt. Because my heart is pure and in Rama also, there are many good qualities existing."
5-37-13,"O Hanuma! In Rama are figured, pesseverence, manliness, courage, non-mischievousness, gratitude, prowess and energy."
5-37-14,"Which Rama, who without the help of Lakshmana his brother, killed fourteen thousand demos in Janasthana (part of the forest), what adversary will not have fear of such a man?"
5-37-15,"Rama, the excellent among men, is not compelled to be moved by troubles. I now well the energy of Rama, as Shachi the wife of Indra knows the energy of Indra the Lord of celestials."
5-37-16,"O Hanuma! The powerful Rama like the sun, with his multitude of ray-like arrows, will dry up the water in the form of hostile adversaries."
5-37-17,"Hanuma spoke the following words to Seetha, who was thus talking with grief for Rama and with her eyes full of tears."
5-37-18,"Soon after hearing my words, Rama will soon come, engaging a great army comprising of a multitude of monkeys and bears with him."
5-37-19,"O Seetha with a charming face! Or rather, I shall relieve you from this grief now itself. O irreproachable lady! Ascend my back. I shall take you to Rama."
5-37-20,"I shall cause you sit on my back and cross the ocean. I have indeed capacity to carry even Lanka together with Ravana."
5-37-21,"O Seetha! Now itself, I shall cause you to reach Rama who is staying at Prasravana Mountain, even as fire-god hands over the oblations offered in the sacrifices to Indra the Lord of celestials."
5-37-22,"O Seetha! Now itself, you can see Rama together with Lakshmana, getting ready for a strenuous effort to annihilate the demons, as Vishnu the Lord of Preservation getting ready for killing of demons."
5-37-23,"The mighty Rama, with a gusto to see you, is staying in a hermitage, even as Indra the destroyer of strong-holds sitting on the back of Airavata the elephant."
5-37-24,"O Seetha the auspicious princess! Mount on my back. Do not have any hesitation. Be inclined of joining Rama even as Rohini, moon&#39;s favourite wife, joined the moon."
5-37-25,"You ascend my back and cross the ocean by journeying through the sky, as though speaking to the greatly resplendent sun and to the moon."
5-37-26,"O Seetha! While I am taking you from here, no body staying in Lanka is competent to come along with me."
5-37-27,"O Seetha! In what manner I reached here, in the same manner, I shall move through the sky, taking you along with me. See, there is no doubt."
5-37-28,"Hearing those astonishing words from Hanuma, Seetha with her entire limbs flowered with joy, thereafter spoke to Hanuma (as follows):"
5-37-29,"O Hanuma! How are you wishing to carry me for such a long distance? O chief of monkeys! I consider this indeed as your apishness!"
5-37-30,"O Hanuma the best of monkeys! With such a small seized body, how do you wish to take me from here to the presence of my husband, Rama the Lord of human beings?"
5-37-31,"Hearing the words of Seetha, the illustrious Hanuma, the son of wind-god thought it to be the first insult was caused to him."
5-37-32,"(Hanuma said to himself); The black-eyed Seetha is not aware of my strength or power. That is why, let her see the form I can assume at will."
5-37-33,"Hanuma, the best of monkeys and the annihilator of enemies, thinking in this way, then showed his peculiarity to Seetha."
5-37-34,"Hanuma, the intelligent and the excellent of monkeys, leaped down from that tree and then, to create confidence in Seetha, started to increase his body-form."
5-37-35,"Hanuma, the foremost of monkeys, flashed like Meru and Mandara mountains, shining brightly like a blazing fire. He thus stood too in front of Seetha."
5-37-36,"The mighty Hanuma, resembling a mountain, having a red face, having teeth and nails as hard as adamant and terrific in appearance, spoke the following words to Seetha."
5-37-37,"To me, there is capability to carry this Lanka along with its hills, forest-areas, market-places, defensive walls and arches together with its Lord Ravana himself."
5-37-38,"O princess! For this reason, leave your suspicion and keep you mind steady. Come along with me and make Rama and Lakshmana bereft of grief."
5-37-39,"Seetha, with her large eyes resembling lotus-petals, spoke to that terrific Hanuma, the son of wind-god (as follows)"
5-37-40,"O great monkey! I know fully well your courage, strength, your power of movement like that of the wind and your wonderful brilliance like that of the fire."
5-37-41,"O the best of monkeys! How can any other common person cross this unfathomable ocean and reach this place?"
5-37-42,"I know your capacity of carrying and taking me from here. However, we have to determine soon whether the accomplishment of work by the high souled Rama would not thus get spoiled."
5-37-43,"O the faultless one! O the excellent of monkeys! It is not befitting of me to go with you. For, your speed resembling the winds speed, may bewilder my mind."
5-37-44,"Reaching the sky high above the sea, I will fall down out of fear from your back even as you sweep with speed."
5-37-45,"Having fallen insensible into the sea, which is filled with sharks, crocodiles and giant fish, I may become the best food soon for the aquatic creatures."
5-37-46,"O Hanuma the annihilator of enemies! It is not possible for me to go with you. There will also be a risk for you, having me a lady additionally to protect. There is no doubt."
5-37-47,"Seeing me being taken away by you, the demons of terrific prowess, incited by the evil-minded Ravana, will follow you."
5-37-48,"O brave monkey! Those valiant demons wielding darts and clubs in their hands will surround you. Accompanied by a lady in me, you will be at a risk."
5-37-49,"Many demons will come with their weapons, in the sky. You will be alone without any weapon. How can you continue your travel, while protecting me?"
5-37-50,"O the best of monkeys! While you will be resorting to battle with those demons, who perform cruel acts, I, stricken with fear, may fall down from your back."
5-37-51,"O excellent of monkeys! Then the powerful and terrific demons with their giant bodies will conquer you in battle, somehow or other."
5-37-52,"Otherwise, if you are indifferent of me and resort to battle, I may eventually fall down. Then, the wicked demons, catching hold of me fallen, may take me again to Lanka."
5-37-53,"Or they may take me away from your hand, or may even kill me. In battle, victory and defeat are perceived as uncertain."
5-37-54,"O the best of monkeys! Or while I am frightened by the demons, I may get into a mishap. Thus, your effort may become futile indeed!"
5-37-55,"You may be surely able to kill all the demons. But if you alone kill all the demons, Rama&#39;s celebrity will be lowered."
5-37-56,"Otherwise, the demons may take me away and hide me in any secret place that will not be known by those monkeys or even Rama and Lakshmana."
5-37-57,"Then your effort taken for my sake will become futile. That is why there is a great merit in Rama&#39;s coming here along with you."
5-37-58,"O Hanuma the long-armed! The survival of the high souled Rama, his brothers, of yourself and of your royal family (of Sugreeva) is dependent on me."
5-37-59,"Those two men Rama and Lakshmana who are emaciated by grief and anguish along with all bears and monkeys, losing their hope, will abandon their lives."
5-37-60,"O Hanuma, the best of monkeys! Honouring the devotion to my husband, I cannot touch the body of any man other that of Rama."
5-37-61,"That I got, by force, the touch of Ravana&#39;s body, was because being helpless, having lost control of myself and without a protector, I could not do anything."
5-37-62,"If Rama kills Ravana here along with his relatives and departs taking me from here, it would be proper for him"
5-37-63,"I have not only heard but seen myself about the strength of the high souled Rama destroying enemies in battle. Neither the celestials nor the divine musicians nor the serpent-gods nor the demons are equal to Rama in combat."
5-37-64,"Who can withstand seeing in battle that mighty Rama, dazzling like fire fanned by wind, wielding his conspicuous bow and having prowess equal to that of Indra the Lord of celestials, together with Lakshmana?"
5-37-65,"O the best of monkeys! In battle, who can endure Rama resembling the sun at noon-time, with his arrows resembling its rays, the destroyer in battle, stationed like a mythical elephant in rut, along with Lakshmana?"
5-37-66,"O the excellent of monkeys! You, as such, soon bring my husband here along with Lakshmana, and the chiefs of army. O the best of monkeys! I am emaciated with grief about Rama since long. Make me now joyful."
5-38-1,"Hearing those words of Seetha, the eloquent Hanuma was very much pleased and spoke to Seetha (as follows):"
5-38-2,"O Seetha, the beautiful princess! Whatever you spoke is befitting. It is in keeping with woman&#39;s nature and humility of a chaste women."
5-38-3,"It is indeed not fit for a woman to mount on my back and traverse an extensive ocean, which is having a width of one hundred yojanas."
5-38-4,"O Seetha endowed with modesty! The second reason you mentioned that you would not be touching any one else other then Rama is befitting of you, the wife of that high soled Rama. O princess! which other lady except you can speak of such sweet words?"
5-38-5,"O princess! I can completely inform Rama of all that you have done and of all that you have spoken before me."
5-38-6,"O princess! All this was told by me because of several reasons, being desirous of doing good to Rama ad with my mind moistened with affection towards him."
5-38-7,"I spoke this because of the unassailability of Lanka, its great ocean so difficult to be crossed and also my capacity of taking you."
5-38-8,"Because of my great affection and devotion towards you, I wish to carry you well now itself to Rama your hushand. These words were not spoken by me with any other motive."
5-38-9,"O faultless Seetha! If you are not willing to go with me, give me a token of remembrance which Rama can recognise."
5-38-10,"Hearing Hanuma&#39;s words, Seetha like the daughter of a god, slowly spoke the following words, strung together with alphabets of tears: You tell this (following) excellent thing as a token of remembrance to my beloved husband."
5-38-11,"There is a place inhabited by sages at a hillock in the north-eastern It was bountiful with roots fruits and water. In that place, while we were residing in a hermitage of sages, on a day long ago, we were strolling in water in parts of groves with various kinds of flowers of perfume in that hillock. Your thereupon became wet and sat at my proximity."
5-38-12,"Then, a crow, yearning for meat, began to peck me. Picking up a clod of earth, I prevented the crow from its act."
5-38-13,"Pecking me again and again, the crow was hiding there only. That crow, yearning for food, did not resig from meat."
5-38-14,"While I was angry with that bird, my skirt was slipping and I was pulling its string (so as to tighten it). I was seen by you then."
5-38-15,"Moved by anger, I felt abashed for being laughed at by you. Torn down by the crow, which was yearning for food, I sought shelter with you."
5-38-16,"Feeling tired, I again settled on your lap. As though angry, I was consoled by you and I was fully delighted."
5-38-17,"Slowly wiping my eyes, my face filled with tears, I was seen by you, O Lord, as having been annoyed by the crow."
5-38-18,"I even slept for a long time on Rama&#39;s lap because of my fatigue. In his turn, Rama the elder brother of Bharata, slept in my arms."
5-38-19,"Meanwhile, the same crow appeared there. Descending all of a sudden, the crow clawed me at the space between the breasts, even as I awoke from my sleep and rose from the lap of Rama. Flying up again, it tore me up a lot."
5-38-20,"Then, Rama got wet by the discharged drops of blood. Thereafter, that splendorous Rama, the annihilator of enemies, who was in a pleasant slumber, was woken up by that crow and by me who was grievously tormented by the crow."
5-38-21,"That long-armed Rama, seeing me pierced violently on the breasts, then spoke the following words, hissing like an angry serpant."
5-38-22,"O Seetha the round-thighed woman! Who has wounded the space between your breasts? who is playing with a fire-faced serpent filled with fury?"
5-38-23,"&#39;Then, throwing a glance around, Rama saw that crow with its sharp claws moistened iwth blood and sitting in front of me alone."
5-38-24,"That crow, the best among birds, seems to be the son of Indra the Lord of celestials, staying in mountains and moving with a peed equal to the wind."
5-38-25,"Then, the long-armed Rama, the best among wise men, swirling his eyes in anger, made a resolve in the matter of that ferocious crow."
5-38-26,"Taking a blade of Kusa grass from his bed ( made of Kusa grass), Rama employed it to work with Brahma&#39;s missile (a mythical weapon which deals with infallible destruction). That blazing shoot of grass, resembling a fire destroying the world, flared up in front of that bird."
5-38-27,"As Rama threw that blazing blade of Kusa grass towards that crow, that blade of grass went chasing that crow in the sky."
5-38-28,"Then, while that blade of grass came chasing, that crow went flying in many a way. Seeking protection, it roamed all over the world."
5-38-29,"Roaming the three worlds in search of a saviour, that crow was abandoned by Indra; its father, the celestials and the sages. Finally, it sought refuge in the same Rama."
5-38-30,"That Rama, who affords protection, was compassionate and protected that crow, which fell on the ground (in salutation to Rama) and sought for protection, eventhough it was apt to be killed."
5-38-31,"Seeing that crow, coming exhausted and dejected, Rama said to it: &#39;It is not possible to make Brahma missile a waste. For this reason, tell me what to do now."
5-38-32,"Thereafter, that crow said Let your arrow shoot my right eye. Then that blade of Kusa grass shooted the right eye of that crow. By giving away its right eye in that way, the crow saved its life."
5-38-33,"After offering salutations to Rama and King Dasaratha and being discharged by that valiant Rama, the crow returned to its own abode."
5-38-34,"O lord of the earth! For my sake you hurled a Brahma&#39;s missile even at a crow. Why are you forgiving the one who has taken me away from you?"
5-38-35,"O Rama the best among men! You, with great strength, annihilate the enemy and bestow your mercy on me. O Lord! She who has a protector in you, actually looks like one without any protector."
5-38-36,"You yourself told me that kindness is the best righteousness. I know you, having a great prowess, a great energy, and a great strength. I know your non-acquiescence, imperturbability, profoundness like an ocean, as Lord of the earth including the oceans and as equal to Indra the Lord of celestials."
5-38-37,"O Rama! Eventhough you are strong, excellently skilled in archery and a truthful man, why are you not utilizing your arrow on demons?"
5-38-38,"Neither the serpent-demons, nor the divine musicians nor the demons nor the storm-gods are able to resist the onrush of Rama in battle."
5-38-39,"If the valiant Rama has any haste in my case, why does he not destroy the demons with his sharp arrows?!"
5-38-40,"For what reason, even Lakshmana the tormentator of enemies, the mighty man and the valiant man does not protect me, by taking the command of his elder brother?&#39;"
5-38-41,"Those two tigers among men, Rama and Lakshmana, with a sharpness equal to that of wind and fire, even if they are unconquerable by demons too, why are they neglecting me?"
5-38-42,"There is not doubt that I would have committed a great sin, for which reason those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana the tormentators of enemies, even when capable , are neglecting me."
5-38-43,"Hearing the pitiable appeal Seetha with tears, Hanuma of great splendour and the son of wind-god spoke (as follows)"
5-38-44,"O Seetha! Rama has grown averse to everything else, caused by grief towards you. I swear it to you by truth. When Rama is overpowered by grief; Lakshmana too gets tormented by grief."
5-38-45,"O faultless Seetha! Somehow or other, you have been discovered by me. This is not the time to lament. Your will see the end of your sorrow within a short time."
5-38-46,"Those two mighty princes, the excellent among men, are eager to see you and they will reduce Lanka to ashes."
5-38-47,"O large-eyed Seetha! Killing the cruel Ravana along with his relatives in battle, Rama will take you back to his own city."
5-38-48,"Tell me what to be expressed to Rama or to the mighty Lakshmana or to the splendourous Sugreeva or even to the other monkeys assembled there."
5-38-49,"Hearing the words of Hanuma, Seetha, like the daughter of a sage, tormented with grief, spoke to Hanuma the monkey (as follows):"
5-38-50,"On my behalf, salute by bowing your head and ask about the welfare of Rama, the Lord of the worlds, whom the magnanimous Kausalya gave birth."
5-38-51,"(On my behalf, ask about the welfare of ) Lakshmana, that good child of Sumitra who, having renounced the wreaths of flowers, all the riches, pleasant and beautiful girls and even the prosperity difficult to be obtained in this extensive world, offered his profound respects to and pacified his father and mother, followed Rama to exile."
5-38-52,"Renouncing a great comfort, the righteous Lakshmana, acting in an affectionate manner towards Rama, followed him, watching over him in the forest."
5-38-53,"Lakshmana, who has broad shoulders like that ofa lion, mighty-armed, steady-minded and having pleasant looks, behaves towards Rama as towards his father and looks to me as his own mother."
5-38-54,"The valiant Lakshmana, on that day of occurrence, did not know that I was being taken away by Ravana. He serves elders. He possesses a splendour. Though capable, he does not talk much. To Dasaratha, my father-in-law, he is his replica a beloved and the best prince."
5-38-55,"Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama is the one who is dearer to me always. That energetic Lakshmana carries out well, whatever load of work is entrusted to him"
5-38-56,"Seeing whom, Rama ceases to recollect his deceased father, that Lakshmana is to be asked about his well-being, as my word and on my behalf."
5-38-57,"O Hanuma, the excellent of monkeys and the best of monkeys! you are the model for fulfilling this act of addressing him in such a way that Lakshmana, the mild, every-pure and clever darling of Rama may bring my sorrows to an end."
5-38-58,"Depending on your effort, Rama will be more active with his effort the following words again and again to Rama, my Lord and the hero:"
5-38-59,"O Rama! I shall hold my life for a month. I cannot survive after a month I am telling you the truth."
5-38-60,"O valiant man! You are required to rescue me, detained (as I am) by Ravana the criminal and subjected to humiliation, as you (as Lord Vishnu) earlier protected Indra the Lord of celestials and Lakshmi the goddess of prosperity from the abode of servants and demons."
5-38-61,"Then, untying the bright devine jewel for her head tied in her garment, Seetha gave it to Hanuma, saying that it might be handed over to Rama."
5-38-62,"Taking the excellent jewel, the valiant Hanuma thereupon fitted it to his finger, since his arm (eventhough he had assumed his former tiny form), was not fitting to it properly."
5-38-63,"Receiving that jewel, Hanuma the best among the monkeys, offered his salutation to seetha, by engaging himself in circumambulation and stood aside with humbleness."
5-38-64,"Filled with a great delight, born out of Seetha&#39;s discovery by him, that Hanuma mentally sought (the presence) of Rama but stood there with just his physical body."
5-38-65,"Taking that excellent and highly venerable jewel, worn by Seetha and by its influence resembling one who was shaken by a blast coming from the top of a huge mountain, Hanuma was mentally pleased and set out for crossing the ocean in his return journey."
5-39-1,"Then, after giving the jewel for head, Seetha spoke to Hanuma as follows: This token of remembrance is actually known to Rama."
5-39-2,"By seeing this jewel, the heroic Rama can recollect three of us, viz. my mother, myself and the king Dasaratha."
5-39-3,"O Hanuma the excellent among monkeys! Driven by your enthusiasm again, think what remains to be done in undertaking this task."
5-39-4,"O Hanuma the best among monkeys! You are capable of fulfilling this task. O Hanuma! Become the one who can remove my misfortunes, by employing your effort. If you think of it carefully, your effort will become the one which can remove my misfortunes."
5-39-5,"That Hanuma of terrific prowess, having promised &#39;so be it&#39;, offered salutation to Seetha by bowing his head to her and was set off to go."
5-39-6,"Getting to know Hanuma ready to set out, Seetha the princess spoke the following words with her voice choked by tears."
5-39-7,"O Hanuma, the excellent among monkeys! Ask about the welfare of both Rama and Lakshmana together. You also ask, according to our usage, about the welfare of Sugreeva together with his ministers and of all the monkeys who are elder."
5-39-8,"You deserve to evolve a strategy through which the long-armed Rama can make me to cross over this ocean of misfortunes."
5-39-9,"O Hanuma! Tell, in whatever manner, by which the illustrious Rama can console me, even while I am still surviving. Reap righteousness, by helping me through your word."
5-39-10,"Constantly hearing the words endowed with energy spoken by you, Rama&#39;s manly strength will be intensified to recover me."
5-39-11,"&#39;Hearing the words containing my message from you, the valiant Rama will duly set his heart in exercising his strength."
5-39-12,"Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma the son of wind-god, having placed his open hands side by side, slightly shallowed on his head in salutation), spoke the following words in reply."
5-39-13,"Coming soon together with valiant monkeys and bears, Rama after defeating the enemies in battle, will eliminate your sorrow."
5-39-14,"While discharging his arrows, none can be seen either in men or in monkeys or in celestials who are able to stand before Rama in battle."
5-39-15,"That Rama is capable of enduring even the sun-god, even Indra the god of rain or even Yama the god of death, son of the sun-god a battle-field especially for your sake."
5-39-16,"Rama is indeed worthwhile to master the entire earth bounded by the ocean. O Seetha! Rama&#39;s victory is indeed for your sake."
5-39-17,"Hearing those words of Hanuma, spoken rightly and truly well, Seetha held him in great respect and proceeded to speak (the following) words:"
5-39-18,"Thereupon, looking again and again towards that Hanuma who was going away, Seetha kind-heartedly adored his words endowed with friendliness for her husband."
5-39-19,"O valiant monkey, the annihilator of enemies! If you are agreeable, stay for a day at any one secret place. After taking rest, you can go tomorrow."
5-39-20,"O Hanuma! Because of your vicinity, there may be a relief for a moment to this great sorrow of me, who is less fortunate."
5-39-21,"O Hanuma the lion among the monkeys! If after that, there is any doubt about your return, there is a doubt even for my survival too. There is no suspicion about this matter."
5-39-22,"&#39;O Hanuma! To me, who is tormented by one grief after another grief, my sorrow due to your disappearance will further torment me, like a burning flame."
5-39-23,"O best among the monkeys! O valiant one! In the matter of monkeys and bears who are your helpmates, this highly great doubt is lingering before me."
5-39-24,"How indeed can those troops of monkeys and bears or Rama and Lakshmana can cross that great insurmountable ocean?"
5-39-25,"Three beings viz. Garuda the eagle, or yourself or the wind-god only have the capacity of crossing this ocean."
5-39-26,"O valiant monkey! That is why, what strategy are you visualizing to fulfill this act, which is thus impassable? You are indeed excellent of those who know how to accomplish a task."
5-39-27,"O Hanuma the annihilator of hostile enemies! You, as one alone, is capable of fulfilling this task. Your act of fulfilling the result is well-known."
5-39-28,"If Rama defeats Ravana with his entire army in battle and as a champion takes me back to his own city, it will be quite worthy of him."
5-39-29,"If Rama, the destroyer of rival army, fills the entire Lanka with his arrows and takes me home, it will be quite worthy of him."
5-39-30,"For that reason, you act in such a way, that Rama the high-souled man, valiant in battle, may exhibit the prowess befitting of him."
5-39-31,"Hearing those words, which were meaningful humble and attended with reason, Hanuma gave his final reply (as follows)"
5-39-32,"O Seetha the princess! Sugreeva, the Lord of the troops of monkeys and bears and the premost among the monkeys, who is endowed with strength, is firmly determined in your cause."
5-39-33,"O Seetha! That Sugreeva, endowed with thousands and crores of monkeys, will come soon to destroy the demons."
5-39-34,"So many monkeys, endowed with prowess, perseverance, great strength and who can rush to any place as they wish are intensely committed to Sugreeva&#39;s command."
5-39-35,"There is no hindrance to their movement either in the sky or in the ground or in any horizontal region (between the sky and the ground) with unlimited splendour are not indolent in performing any great task."
5-39-36,"The earth with its oceans and mountains has been circumambulated clockwise many times by those monkeys, who are highly energetic and who follow the aerial path."
5-39-37,"In them, some of the monkeys are superior to me and some are even equal to me. No one in the vicinity of Sugreeva is inferior to me."
5-39-38,"When I have arrived here, why to talk about the mighty ones? Generally, superior ones are not sent for errands. Only others are indeed sent."
5-39-39,"O Seetha the princess! Enough of your lamentation. Take away your sorrow. Those leaders of monkeys will reach Lanka by one single leap."
5-39-40,"Rama and Lakshmana, those two lions among men also of great strength, ascending on my shoulders, can come to you, like the rising sun and the moon."
5-39-41,"Coming together, Rama and Lakshmana the valiant and the excellent among men, can destroy the City of Lanka with their arrows."
5-39-42,"O Seetha with a good waist! Rama, the delight of Raghu dynasty, killing Ravana together with his troops, will return to his town, duly taking you with him."
5-39-43,"For that reason, console yourself indeed! Happiness to you! If you wait for some time, you shall see, within a short time, Rama like a blazing fire."
5-39-44,"When this king of demons is killed along with his sons, ministers and relatives, you will meet Rama, as Rohini* met the moon."
5-39-45,"O Seetha the princess! You shall see the end of your sorrow soon. Within a short time, you will also see the end of Ravana, as destroyed by Rama."
5-39-46,"Thus consoling Seetha, Hanuma the son of wind-god made up his mind to go back and spoke to Seetha again as follows:"
5-39-47,"That Rama the annihilator of enemies, who firmly decided to destroy his adversaries and Lakshmana wielding a bow in his hand will soon reach the entrance of Lanka and you will see them."
5-39-48,"You can see soon those valiant monkeys, with their claws and tusks as weapons, having the prowess of lions and tigers and looking like lordly elephants, coming together."
5-39-49,"O venerable lady! You shall see many troops of excellent monkeys resembling hills and clouds, thundering on the peaks of Malaya mountain in Lanka."
5-39-50,"Hit in the vitals by the darts of venerable Manmatha the god of love, Rama is not obtaining happiness, as an elephant gets tormented by a lion."
5-39-51,"O Seetha the princess! Do not weep with grief. Let your mind be without any unpleasantness. You are indeed having Rama your husband as your protector like Shachi having Indra her husband as a protector."
5-39-52,"Who else is there greater than Rama or who else equal to Lakshmana? Those two brothers, like fire and wind, are supportive to you."
5-39-53,"O Seetha the princess! You will not stay for long at this place, which is very terrific and occupied with a multitude of demons. The arrival of your husband will not be delayed. Be patient till the moment of my meeting with Rama on my return."
5-40-1,"Hearing the words of that high-souled Hanuma, Seetha who resembled the daughter of god, spoke the following words beneficial to herself."
5-40-2,"O Hanuma! Seeing you speaking pleasant words, I am as overjoyed, as a field with half-sprouted crop of grain is thrilled by receiving a rain."
5-40-3,"With my limbs emaciated with grief, I have a desire to touch that Rama the tiger among men. Show mercy on me and fulfill my desire."
5-40-4,"O Hanuma the excellent one among the troops of monkeys! Present the story of the blade of grass called Ishika hurled with anger and thereby one eye of the crow destroyed by Rama (as a signal remembrance)."
5-40-5,"O Rama! You ought surely to recollect that while a mark on my forehead had got effaced once, another mark with realgar was indeed painted by you on the side of my cheek."
5-40-6,"How are you, the valiant man equal to Indra the Lord of celestials and Varuna the King of Universe, ignore Seetha who was taken away and now staying in the midst of these demons?"
5-40-7,"O faultless Rama! This wonderful jewel for the head head has been protected well by me. Seeing this in my distress, I have been getting delighted, as though I have seen you."
5-40-8,"This splendid jewel, produced in water, has been sent to you. Absorbed in grief, I shall not be able to survive henceforth."
5-40-9,"With a hope of your coming here at any time, I am enduring these unbearable hardships and also the words of horrible female demons; which pierce my heart."
5-40-10,"O Rama the prince, the annihilator of enemies! I shall hold my life only for a month. I will not survive without you, after a month."
5-40-11,"This Ravana, the king of demons, is terrible. In my instance, his glance is not pleasant. Hearing that you are causing a delay, I will not survive even for a moment."
5-40-12,"Hearing the words of Seetha, spoken pitiably with tears, Hanuma the son of wind-god, with a great splendour, spoke (as follows):"
5-40-13,"O Seetha the princess! Rama has grown averse to everything else, caused by grief towards you. I sear it to you truly. when Rama is overpowered by grief, Lakshmana too gets tormented with grief. O lady! Somehow or other, you have been discovered by me. This is not the time to lament. You will see the end of your sorrow shortly. Those two princes, the excellent among men, the annihilator of enemies and who are eager to see you, will surely reduce Lanka to ashes. O large-eyed Seetha! Killing the cruel Ravana along with his relatives, Rama and Lakshmana will take you to their own city."
5-40-14,"O faultless Seetha! Be pleased to give another token of remembrance, which Rama will recognise and which creates pleasure to him."
5-40-15,"Seetha said,  An excellent token of remembrance was indeed given by me. Seeing this jewel for my hair, Rama will trust your words."
5-40-16,"Taking that excellent jewel, the illustrious Hanuma, the best among monkeys, offered salutation to Seetha by bowing his head and has set off to go."
5-40-17,"Seeing that Hanuma, the best among monkeys, possessed of energy to jump up with great speed and expanding, Seetha spoke (as follows) in her voice choked with tears and looking miserable in her face filled with tears."
5-40-18,"O Hanuma! Enquire about the welfare of Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers looking like lions, of Sugreeva together with his ministers and of all other."
5-40-19,"Be pleased to make that long-armed Rama deliver me from this ocean of sorrow."
5-40-20,"O valiant monkey! After approaching Rama, appraise him of this terrific gush of my grief and also about the threatening attitude of these female-demons. Have a happy journey!"
5-40-21,"Having been appraised of the matter by Seetha the princess, having accomplished his object, having his mind filled with joy and having perceived that only a little remained to be done, Hanuma intellectually sought the northern direction."
5-41-1,"Seetha honoured Hanuma, who was ready to go, with good words. Hanuma, having gone to a distance from that place, thought within himself (as follows):"
5-41-2,"I have seen this black-eyed Seetha. There is only a little that remains to be done by me. Abandoning the three strategies for success viz. sowing dissension, negotiation and bribery, I have to implement here the fourth strategy viz. open assault."
5-41-3,"In the case of demons, the strategy of negotiation is not practicable. For those persons having abundant wealth, the strategy of bribery is not suitable. For persons who are proud of their strength, the strategy of sowing dissension is not amenable. Prowess alone is agreeable for me here."
5-41-4,"Except showing of valour, no strategy in accomplishing this task is adequate in these circumstances, for the demons can adopt a weak attitude in the ensuring combat, if their foremost heroes are somehow killed here and now."
5-41-5,"He alone can accomplish his purpose, who implements many (secondary) tasks even after the initial task has been carried through, without impairing the previous achievement."
5-41-6,"&#39;There is indeed no single exclusive method to accomplish a purpose however small a task may be. On the other hand, whoever knows to do a task in many ways, he alone is capable of achieving that task."
5-41-7,"&#39;If I go to the abode of Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys, having ascertained the truth as to who will predominate in an encounter between the adversary and ourselves here itself, then will the command of my master have been carried out by me."
5-41-8,"How can my combat with the demons now will prove to be a happy one? And, how will my strength become fruitful? How indeed will that Ravana applaud me in battle?"
5-41-9,"Then meeting Ravana with his troop of ministers, his army and his followers in battle as well as knowing his designs and strength, I will go back from here happily."
5-41-10,"This excellent grove of this cruel Ravana, with its various kinds of trees and creepers, which is pleasing to the eyes and the mind, is looking like Nandana, Indra&#39;s paradise."
5-41-11,"I will destroy this grove like fire scorching a dried up forest. While this grove gets demolished, Ravana will then be angry."
5-41-12,"Thereupon Ravana will order for an army consisting of horses, great chariots and elephants and armed with weapons like great tridents and spears made of iron. Then, a great combat will follow."
5-41-13,"Attacking those demons of terrific prowess, I too with my unbearable prowess, will kill that army instigated by Ravana and return to the place of Sugreeva happily."
5-41-14,"Thereafter, Hanuma of terrific prowess, getting angry, started then to throw away trees by a highly violent jerk of his thighs akin to the jerk of a wind."
5-41-15,"Then, the valiant Hanuma laid waste the royal garden attached to the gynaecium resonant with cries of birds in heat and endowed with various kinds of trees and creepers."
5-41-16,"Hanuma damaged trees in that grove, destroyed the ponds and crushed the tops of pleasure hills to powder. Thus, that grove became nasty at sight."
5-41-17,"With its trees and creepers dried up, with the howls of various birds, with its ponds destroyed, with its copper-coloured sprouts dried up there, that grove did not look bright, as though it had been destroyed by a wild fire. Those creepers with their bars of support displaced, fell down like distressed woman."
5-41-18,"With its arbours and picture-galleries destroyed, its great serpents and wild animals emitting cries of distress, its grottos and other structures demolished, that grove became defaced."
5-41-19,"That woody land of that pleasure-garden which afforded shelter to the women-folk of Ravana and which has clusters of Ashoka creepers became a jumble of creepers of sorrow for the distressed women; by the violence of Hanuma."
5-41-20,"Creating a great displeasure to the mind of that high-souled Ravana, the Lord of the land of Lanka; that Hanuma decided to fight alone against many mighty demons and stayed"
5-42-1,"At the screaming sound of birds and at the sound of the crash of falling trees, all the inhabitants of Lanka then became trembled with fear."
5-42-2,"Made to run to-and-fro and getting frightened, beasts and birds began to scream. Atrocious omens made their appearance before the demons."
5-42-3,"Then, the ugly-faced female-demons, whose sleep has vanished, found that grove demolished and saw that great heroic monkey."
5-42-4,"Seeing those female-demons, the mighty armed Hanuma endowed with a great courage and might, assumed a gigantic form which created a terror to the female-demons."
5-42-5,"Beholding that mighty monkey having a gigantic body similar to a mountain, the female-demons then asked Seetha (as follows):"
5-42-6,"Who is he? Whose messenger is he? From where and for what purpose he has come here? Wherefore a conversation was held by him with you?"
5-42-7,"O large-eyed Seetha! Tell us. Let there be no fear for you, O fortunate lady! What did he speak to you? O lady having black outer eye-corners!"
5-42-8,"Thereupon Seetha the virtuous lady, having a complete beauty of all limbs, spoke as follows: Where is the ability for me to know about the demons of a terrific form?"
5-42-9,"You alone can recognise who he is and what he does. A serpent only can recognise the feet of another serpent. There is no doubt about it."
5-42-10,"By seeing him, I too get frightened. I do not know who he is. I only know him as a demon, able to assume any form at his will, who arrived here."
5-42-11,"Hearing the words of Seetha some female-demons fled to different directions. Some stayed back. Some others went to Ravana to inform about the matter."
5-42-12,"After approaching Ravana, the female demons of ugly faces started to tell (as follows) of the monstrous and terrific monkey."
5-42-13,"O king! A monkey having a terrific body and a boundless prowess, is stationed in the middle of Ashoka grove and made a conversation with Seetha."
5-42-14,"Eventhough questioned in many ways by us, Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, having eyes similar to those of a doe, is not inclined to tell about the monkey."
5-42-15,"He may be a messenger of Indra the Lord of celestials, or the messenger of Kubera the king of riches or even a messenger sent by Rama to search for Seetha."
5-42-16,"He, having a wonderful form, has wiped off your grove, attached to the gynaecium, which is fascinating and extending with many kinds of animal-flock."
5-42-17,"There is no place whatsoever in that grove, which was not destroyed by him. Only that place, where Seetha the daughter of Janaka was sitting, was not destroyed by him."
5-42-18,"It is not known whether to protect Seetha or because of fatigue, he has left that place undestroyed, or else, what fatigue is there for him? He has done it to protect Seetha."
5-42-19,"That well-grown Simsupa tree, abounding in charming sprouts and flowers, under which Seetha herself took shelter, has been spared by him."
5-42-20,"To that terribly looking monkey by whom Seetha was spoken to and that grove destroyed you to order a terrible punishment."
5-42-21,"O chief of the demons-troops! Who would dare to talk to that Seetha, who has been mentally accepted by you, except perhaps he who is ready to abandon his life?"
5-42-22,"Hearing the words of the female-demons, Ravana the lord of demons flared up like a funeral fire, his eyes spinning with anger."
5-42-23,"Tears dropped from Ravana&#39;s enraged eyes, like drops of oil dripping from resplendent lamps."
5-42-24,"Ravana, with a great splendour, sent demons with a valiance equal to him, called Kinkaras, in order to catch hold of Hanuma."
5-42-25,"He ordered for eighty thousand of those Kinkaras who were strong. All those mighty Kinkaras with their large bellies, long tusks and terrible forms, longing to fight with iron mallets and clubs in hand, in eagerness to lay hold on Hanuma, started from that place."
5-42-26,"Approaching Hanuma who was standing near the arched doorway, they rushed towards him with a great speed, like locusts rushing towards a fire."
5-42-27,"They banged Hanuma with various kinds of maces, iron bludgeons plated with gold and arrows shining like the sun."
5-42-28,"Quickly surrounding Hanuma with clubs, sharp edged spears, iron pikes, lances, javelins and swords, they stood in front of him."
5-42-29,"The highly splendorous and illustrious Hanuma too, looking like a mountain, hurled his tail on the ground, making a thunderous noise."
5-42-30,"The highly splendourous and illustrious Hanuma too, looking like a mountain, hurled his tail on the ground, making a thunderous noise."
5-42-31,"By that great sound made by Hanuma through clapping on his arms together with a resound, birds fell down from the sky. Hanuma also then cried aloud with a clamorous voice (as follows):"
5-42-32,"Long live the mighty Rama and the powerful Lakshmana! Long live the King Sugreeva, protected by Rama!"
5-42-33,"I am Hanuma, the destroyer of the army of adversaries and the son of wind-god. I am the servant of Rama, the king of Kosala Kingdom, who is unwearied in action."
5-42-34,"Even a thousand of Ravanas will not be matching equally with me, who is capable of striking with thousands of rocks and trees in battle."
5-42-35,"Here, before the eyes of all the demons, I will annihilate the City of Lanka and after offering salutation to Seetha, I will go back after fully completing my task."
5-42-36,"Those demons became frightened by the clamorous voice of Hanuma cried aloud and saw him to be as high as a twilight rain-cloud."
5-42-37,"Not feeling apprehended because of the orders of their king, those demons thereafter rushed towards Hanuma, with their terrific and amazing weapons."
5-42-38,"Surrounded on all sides by those strong demons, that Hanuma endowed with a great strength seized a huge iron bar belonging to the arched gate."
5-42-39,"Taking that iron rod, Hanuma killed the demons. That violent Hanuma strolled in the sky, taking that iron rod in his hand, as Garuda the eagle would carrying a serpent in its claws."
5-42-40,"Killing the valiant demons called Kinkaras, that heroic Hanuma wishing to fight again, arrived at the archy gate way."
5-42-41,"Some demons, who somehow escaped from that terror, went to Ravana and informed him that all the Kinkaras have been killed."
5-42-42,"Hearing of large army of demons having been killed, that Ravana with his eyes rolling rapidly (with anger), ordered Jambumali, son of Prahasta, who was unequal in prowess and admirably unconquerable in battle."
5-43-1,"After killing the Kinkaras, that Hanuma thought to himself (as follows): The grove was damaged by me. The lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary (sacred to the guardian-deity of the demons) has not been destroyed. For that reason, I will cause this mansion to crumble down in the same way. Thus thinking himself, Hanuma the best among monkeys, son of the wind-god having large jaws, by showing his strength, bounced up and ascended the lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary, which was as high as a mountain-top of Meru."
5-43-2,"That Hanuma, an army-chief of monkeys, possessing a very great splendour, ascending the lofty palatial mansion similar to a mountain shone like a second rising sun."
5-43-3,"Overpowering the lofty and inviolable of the sanctuary, Hanuma blazing mansion his splendour, meta morposed into a towering sized body equal to that of Pariyatra mountain."
5-43-4,"Enhancing his body to a very big size by dint of his distinction, Hanuma clapped on his arms strongly, filling the City of Lanka with sound."
5-43-5,"By the great deafening noise, made by clapping on his arms, the birds and also the guards protecting the sanctuary unconsciously fell down."
5-43-6,"Long live Rama, skilled in archery and the powerful Lakshmana! Long lie the King Sugreeva, protected by Rama! I am Hanuma, the destroyer of the army of adversaries and the son of wind-god. I am the servent of Rama, the king of Kosala kingdom, who is unwearied in action. Even a thousand of Ravanas will not be matching equally with me, who is capable of striking with thousnads of rocks and trees in battle. Here, before the eyes of all the demons, I will annihilate the City of Lanka and after offering salutation to Seetha, I will go back duly completing my task."
5-43-7,"Thus uttering to those guards protecting the sanctuary, roared terribly, making a noise and creating a terror to the demons."
5-43-8,"Hearing that loud noise, hundreds of guards protecting the sanctuary went, taking many kinds of weapons, spears, swords and axes. Those Kinkaras with huge bodies surrounded Hanuma, duly discharging those weapons."
5-43-9,"They banged Hanuma with various kinds of maces, iron bludgeons plated with gold and arrows shining like the sun. That troop of demons surrounding Hanuma the best among monkeys, shone like a greatly extensive whirlpool in the waters of River Ganga."
5-43-10,"Thereupon, the enraged Hanuma assumed a terrific form. Hanuma possessing a gigantic body and the son of wind-god, uprooting a pillar with a hundred edges and decorated with gold in that edifice, then speedily whirled it around."
5-43-11,"Fire was also generated there (due to friction with other pillars) The edifice was then consumed by fire. Seeing the edifice burning, that Hanuma killing those hundred demons, like Indra killing demons with his thunderbolt and gloriously staying in the sky, spoke (the following) words:"
5-43-12,"Thousands of monkeys like me, possessing gigantic bodies of strength, were sent on the orders of Sugreeva. We and other monkeys are now roaming the entire earth."
5-43-13,"Some of the monkeys are having a strength of ten elephants. Some are having a strength of a hundred elephants. Some are having a prowess equal to that of a thousand elephants."
5-43-14,"Some are having the strength of a strong stream. Some have strength equal to that of wind. Some other army-chiefs of monkeys even cannot be measured."
5-43-15,"Surrounded by hundreds, myriads, lakhs and crores of such monkeys having their teeth and nails as their weapons, Sugreeva, who is capable of destroying you all, will come."
5-43-16,"You hold enmity with the high souled Rama. For this, the City of Lanka will not be there. Neither you, nor even Ravana will survive."
5-44-1,"Jambumali, the demon with great tusks, wielding a bow, donning crimson garlands and clothes, wearing beautiful chaplet and charming ear-rings, possessing a gigantic body, having round and open eyes, the demon causing diseases, unconquerable in battle, a strong demon and the son of Prahasta, commanded by Ravana, started stretching with rashness his big bow resembling a rain bow garnished splendorous arrows and which brilliance was similar to that of a lightening and produced a sound like that of a thunder."
5-44-2,"The tumultuous sound created out of the twanging of that bow, soon filled up the quarters, intermediate points and the sky."
5-44-3,"Seeing him, arriving by a chariot yoked with donkeys, that Hanuma who was endowed with swiftness, was thrilled with joy and made a noise too."
5-44-4,"The long-armed Jambumali transfixed sharp arrows into that great monkey, Hanuma who was standing on the top of the archy door-way."
5-44-5,"He transfixed Hanuma the leader of monkeys in the face with an arrow with a crescent-shaped head, on the head with an arrow having an ear-shaped top and in the arms with ten steel arrows."
5-44-6,"That crimson face of Hanuma, hit by an arrow, shone like a full-blown lotus touched by a sun&#39;s ray in autumn."
5-44-7,"That face of Hanuma, which was naturally crimson in colour, smeared with blood, beamed like a large lotus in the sky sprinkled with drops of sandal."
5-44-8,"Hanuma, struck by those arrows, was enraged with that demon and then saw by his side, a big rock of a very large measure."
5-44-9,"Uplifting that rock with strength, the athletic Hanuma hurled it with force. The enraged demon then struck back that rock with ten arrows."
5-44-10,"Seeing that work in vain, the powerful Hanuma of terrific prowess, uprooted a very large sal tree and whirled it around."
5-44-11,"Seeing the mighty Hanuma, whirling around the sal tree, the exceedingly strong Jambumali discharged numerous arrows."
5-44-12,"He splitted sal tree with four arrows and struck the arms of Hanuma with five arrows, in the chest with one arrow and in the space between the breast wit ten arrows."
5-44-13,"Hanuma, with his body full of arrows, was highly enraged and taking the same iron rod as well as clasping it swiftly, whirled it around."
5-44-14,"Spinning the iron rod with a great speed, Hanuma, richly endowed with strength and highly agitated, threw it on the broad chest of Jamubumali."
5-44-15,"That Jambumali&#39;s head was not there, nor his arms, nor his knees, nor his bow, nor his chariot and nor his horses were seen nor his arrows."
5-44-16,"Thus struck by Hanuma, the mighty Jambumali, with his limbs and ornaments crushed to powder, was instantly killed and fell dead on the ground."
5-44-17,"Hearing Jambumali having been killed, as also the mighty Kimkaras, Ravana was angry with his red enraged eyes."
5-44-18,"Since the mighty son of Prahasta was killed, that Ravana rolling his red eyes with rage, immediately ordered the sons of ministers possessing high strength and prowess, to go to the battle."
5-45-1,"Thereafter, those seven sons of his chief minister having a lustre similar to that of fire, surrounded by a great army, wielding their respective bows, possessing a great strength, well-trained in archery and the best among knower of weapons, wishing a victory reciprocally, having an immense prowess each, and as directed by Ravana, started highly delighted from that palace, in great chariots yoked with horses. Those chariots were having a noise similar to that of an autumnal cloud, overlaid with a protective armour of gold, surmounted by banners and decorated with smaller flags. They were stretching their bows inlaid with refined gold and looking colourful like clouds accompanied by flashes of lightning."
5-45-2,"Coming to know that Kimkaras themselves were killed their mothers together with their relatives and friends were tormented with grief."
5-45-3,"Those sons of chief minister, wearing ornaments made of pure gold, rushed towards Hanuma, who was ready for battle and who stood on the archy gate-way motionless."
5-45-4,"Those demons looking like clouds, diffusing thunder-like sounds of their chariots and discharging a shower of arrows, moved in different directions resembling rainy clouds in the monsoon."
5-45-5,"Thus covered by those showers of arrows, Hanuma became invisible even as a mountain-king is concealed by incessant showers."
5-45-6,"Roaming about in a cloudless sky, that fast-footed monkey made the arrows and the speedy chariots of those virile demons, useless."
5-45-7,"Playing with those demons wielding a bow each in the sky, that hero shone like the Lord of Wind, playing with clouds brandishing a rain bow."
5-45-8,"Making a terrific roar and frightening that great army, the valiant Hanuma rushed on those demons."
5-45-9,"That Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies, struck some with his palms, some with his feet and some others with his fists. He tore down some others with his nails."
5-45-10,"Hanuma crushed some with his chest and some others with his thighs. Some fell down there itself on the ground, just by the roar made by Hanuma."
5-45-11,"Seeing those demons dying and falling on the ground, all the remaining army, afflicted with fear, fled in ten different directions."
5-45-12,"Their elephants trumpeted with a wrong accent. Horses fell down on the ground. Even the earth was filled with chariots which had their seats, banners and canopies broken."
5-45-13,"Thereafter, streams flowing with blood were seen on the way. Lanka resounded with various kinds of horrible voices."
5-45-14,"That heroic and mighty Hanuma having a terrible prowess, killing those arrogant demons and being desirous of a combat with the other demons, again reached that archy door way itself."
5-46-1,"Coming to know that the chief minister&#39;s sons were killed by the high souled who had cleverly concealed the expression made an excellent thought."
5-46-2,"That Ravana ordered (as follows) five foremost leaders of the army viz. Virupaksha, Yupaksha, Durdhara the demon, Praghasa and Bhasakarna, all of them brave demons, skilled in strategy, eager to capture Hanuma and equal to the speed of wind in battle."
5-46-3,"He ordered as follows: March, all of you O generals, taking a large army together that mokey be punished."
5-46-4,"Approaching that monkey, you ought to become diligent. Action should be taken by you which is not out of accord with time and space."
5-46-5,"Judging him by his actions, I do not think him as a mere monkey. By all means, he may be an evil spirit, putting on an extraordinary might."
5-46-6,"This evil spirit may be some being evolved for our sake by Indra the Lord of celestials with a strength of his askesis. Celestials, demons, sages along with Nagas the serpent-demons, Yakshas the spirits and Gandharvas the celestials musicians were conquered by my along with you all together. Even same offensive surely, will be effected to us by them. It is such an evil spirit created by Indra. There is no doubt about it. Let it be captured forcibly. This monkey of a great prowess should not be despised by you."
5-46-7,"Earlier, I saw the monkeys of a great prowess like Vali and Sugreeva, the mighty Jambavan, Nila the Chief of army and so on like Dvivida. their scheme of performance is not so fearful as this; nor their efficacy, nor their prowess, nor their intellect, nor this capacity to change their form or energy at will."
5-46-8,"Keeping in view that it is a great evil spirit standing in the form of a monkey, exert a great effort and capture it."
5-46-9,"The three worlds including Indra, celestials, demons and humans are not fit to stand before you in the battle-field."
5-46-10,"Even then, the one who is skilled in strategy, desirous of a victory in a battle is to protect himself. Victory in a battle is indeed unreliable."
5-46-11,"All of them, having a great strength and a blaze equal to that of fire, accepting the orders of their king and augmenting their strength with chariots, elephants in rut, horses of extra ordinary swiftness and various kinds of sharp weapons, sallied forth with a great speed."
5-46-12,"Thereafter, those valiant demons saw that Hanuma the great monkey, encircled by his rays of splendour like a rising sun, shining, standing on the archy door-way, possessing enormous energy, strong mental disposition and colossal strength."
5-46-13,"Immediately on seeing that Hanuma of great intellect, of great swiftness and of a gigantic body, all those demons, stationed in all quarters, attacked him with their terrific weapons from every side."
5-46-14,"Durdhara discharged five sharp and fierce steel arrows with a lustre of black lily-petals and yellow tops to descend into Hanuma&#39;s head."
5-46-15,"Pierced in the head by those fire arrows, Hanuma leapt roaring in the sky, making the roar reverberating in all directions."
5-46-16,"Then the mighty and the valiant Durdhara leapt into the sky with his chariot. Stretching his bow and throwing hundreds of sharp arrows, he attacked Hanuma."
5-46-17,"Hanuma warded him off from showering the arrows on him in the sky, as the wind wards off a rainy cloud from raining at the end of a monsoon."
5-46-18,"Thus afflicted by that Durdhara, Hanuma then emitted a roar once again and swiftly expanded his body."
5-46-19,"Like a mass of lightning on a mountain, Hanuma instantaneously fell on Durdhara&#39;s chariot, by jumping up from far above with great speed."
5-46-20,"Losing his chariot whose axle and pole had been broken and all his eight horses destroyed, Durdhara then dropped down, losing his life, to the ground."
5-46-21,"Engrossed in anger to see his fallen on the ground, the inviolable virupaksha and Yupaksha, the annihilators of enemies, jumped up into the air."
5-46-22,"Jumping up in the air all of a sudden those two demons struck in the chest with their clubs that long-armed Hanuma standing in clear sky."
5-46-23,"Striking down the swiftness of those violent demons, the mighty Hanuma whose prowess is equal to that of Garuda the eagle, again descended on to the ground."
5-46-24,"Approaching a sala tree and uprooting it, that Hanuma the monkey killed those two valiant demons."
5-46-25,"Getting to know all those mighty three killed by Hanuma, Praghasa with a great alacrity, forcefully attacked Hanuma. The valiant Bhasakarna, highly enraged, attacked taking a spear in his hand."
5-46-26,"The two generals stood by the side of the illustrious Hanuma. Praghasa pierced Hanuma with a sharp-pointed spear and Bhasakarna attacked him with a dart."
5-46-27,"With his limbs wounded by those two demons, that Hanuma with his body-hair anointed by blood, became enraged, with his blaze similar to that of a rising sun."
5-46-28,"Having plucked up the top of a mountain with its various animals serpents and trees, the heroic Hanuma the best among monkeys, killed those two demons."
5-46-29,"When those five army-generals have been killed, Hanuma then destroyed that remaining army."
5-46-30,"Like Indra the thousand-eyed god destroying the demons, Hanuma destroyed the horses by striking them with horses, the elephants with elephants, the warriors with warriors and the chariots with chariots."
5-46-31,"The earth had its path-ways blocked on all sides with the elephants and the horses killed, with the demons killed and with the big chariots which had their axles broken."
5-46-32,"Like Yama the Time-spirit waiting for the right moment for the destruction of the mortals, the heroic Hanuma, killing the eminent demons and the army-generals with their troops and vehicles in the combat, waited for the right moment at the arch-way."
5-47-1,"Hearing and sustaining that the five army-generals along with their followers and vehicles were disposed off by Hanuma, Ravana looked at Aksha, his son, violent in combat and who was inclined to fighting as well as sitting in front of him."
5-47-2,"Goaded by the looks of Ravana, the energetic Aksha, wielding a golden dotted bow, quickly sprang up, like a fire switched up by the foremost of brahmins in a sacrificial fire, by offering oblations to it."
5-47-3,"Mounting a great chariot, having a splendour of a newly risen sun and overlaid with a protective armour of highly refined gold, that valiant cheif of demons sallied forth towards that mighty monkey."
5-47-4,"Aksha&#39;s chariot was earned through many kinds of his penances. It was shining with a protective armour of highly refined gold, adorned with a flag on a flag-staff studded with gems and yoked well with eight excellent horses, having speed equal to that of a mind."
5-47-5,"That chariot was unassailable by celestials or demons. It moved without hindrance to any place. It shone like a sun and could move within the sky. It was well-conceived with a quiver, eight swords and tied with bells. It was orderly arranged with spears and lances in their respective places."
5-47-6,"Then, Aksha having a prowess equal to that of celestials, came forth, mounting that chariot decorated with golden wreaths, having a brilliance of moon and sun, filled with every right thing and shining like rays of sun."
5-47-7,"Aksha, filling the sky earth and its mountains with sounds of horses elephants and chariots, together with his army, approached the efficient Hanuma the great monkey, standing at the archy door-way."
5-47-8,"Approaching that Hanuma, standing there readily to destroy mortals, similar to a fire that is to destroy the world, the yellow-eyed Aksha was bewildered, born of a surprise and looked to him with a great esteem."
5-47-9,"That Aksha, the mighty prince, assessing the swiftness of that high-souled Hanuma and his prowess with regard to his adversaries as also his own strength, increased his body more and more like the sun when the frost is faded away."
5-47-10,"Understanding Hanuma&#39;s prowess to be unrestrainable and stable in battle, that Aksha, exhibiting anger initially, became stable and mentally composed and incited Hanuma to battle by discharging three sharp arrows towards him."
5-47-11,"Recognizing that Hanuma, as a haughty monkey, after having gallantly conquered his adversaries and accustomed to fatigue, that Aksha, graspign the bow and arrows his hand, saw him with an excited mind."
5-47-12,"Having a glden chain, a pair of armlets and charming ear-rings, Aksha of a swift prowess, approached Hanuma. Their unmatched get-together in combat became a baffle to even the celestials and demons."
5-47-13,"Seeing that battle between Hanuma and Aksha, the earth uproared. The sun did not shine brightly. The wind ceased to blow. The mountain shook. The sky made a reverberant sound. The ocean too was agitated."
5-47-14,"Then, that eminent demon, who correctly knew how to fix his gaze on the target, to fit an arrow to the bow and to discharge it, hurled on Hanuma&#39;s head, three arrows which were well-painted, having golden shafts and feathers and which resembled venomous serpants."
5-47-15,"Oozing the blood from his wound caused by those arrows descended into his head (by Aksha), looking like the newly risen sun, his eyes bathed in blood rolling rapidly, Hanuma shone brightly like the sun surrounded by a circle of rays, having the arrows as its rays."
5-47-16,"Seeing in the battle that Aksha the prince, with his marvellous weapons and picturesque bow, that Hanuma the excellent one among Sugree&#39;s counsellors, was rejoiced and with an inclination to fight, grew in size."
5-47-17,"That Hanuma, endowed with strength and prowess, resembling the sun appearing on a peak of Mandara muntain and whose anger was increased, then burnt the prince Aksha along with his army and vehicles, by the rays of fire emnating from his eyes."
5-47-18,"That demon in the form of a cloud, raining down arrows, then wielding a bow in the form of a rain-bow, soon discharged arrows on Hanuma standing in the form of a mountain, like a cloud showering rain on a high mountain."
5-47-19,"Seeing that Aksha the prince, possessing an impetuous valour, endowed with enhanced splendour strength and vigour with a capacity to move within the sky like a cloud, coming to the battle, Hanuma roared with joy."
5-47-20,"Boastful of his valour in battle because of his childish attitude, Aksha wit an enhanced fury and red-blood eyes, approached Hanuma who was incomparable in battle, as an elephant approaching a well covered with heaps of straw."
5-47-21,"As Aksha forcefully discharged his arrows, Hanuma roared a sound of thunder and bounced quickly to the sky assuming a terrible sight, stretching out his arms and thighs."
5-47-22,"That strong and valiant Aksha, the foremost among the demons, and the best among car warriors, went chasing Hanuma who was flying upwards, difusing arrows like a cloud showering hail-stones on a mountian."
5-47-23,"That valiant Hanuma, whose swiftness was equal to the mind and possessing impetuous valour in battle, rushing forth like wind in the space between one arrow and another and thus escaping Aksha&#39;s arrows, moved in the path visited by wind (the sky)."
5-47-24,"With a respectful faculty of sight, Hanuma saw that Aksha who was wielding his bow and readily inclined to fight, covering the entire sky with excellent arrows with various types of tops and became thoughful."
5-47-25,"Then, the mighty armed Hanuma, who knew how to act under particular circumstances, roaring when pierced in the breast with shafts by the high souled heroic, Aksha, reflected on the prowess of his adversary in battle."
5-47-26,"The mighty Aksha, possessing the lustre of a rising sun, is performing a great act, as a mature youth. My mind is not conceding here to kill him, who is distinguished in all acts of war-fare."
5-47-27,"He possesses a great intellect and is also prominent by his valour. He is well-composed and highly tolerant in battle. Due to his eminent deeds and virtues, he is undoubtedly adored by saints, Nagas the serpent-demons and Yakshas the semi-dviine being."
5-47-28,"He is standing very much before me and looks me straight in the eyes, reassured as he is, by his prowess and enthusiasm. His swift-moving prowess trembles even the minds of celestials and demons."
5-47-29,"&#39;If neglected, he would undoubtedly overpower me. His prowess is getting augmented in battle. The only option left out for me is to kill him now. It is not proper to neglect a spreadin fire."
5-47-30,"The valiant and te mighty Hanuma, reflecting thus about the swiftness of the adersary and determining his own couse of action, then acquired a course of action, then acquired a momentum and also made up his mind to kill him."
5-47-31,"That Hanuma, the heroic son of wind, killed using the blows of his palm, those eight horses posessing a great speed in the path of sky with alertness as also having a capacity to bear burden while turning to different directions."
5-47-32,"Then, the great chariot of Aksha, thus struck by the palm and subdued by Hanuma the counsellor of Sugreeva, had its interior broken, its carriage pole loosened and its horses dead and fallen from the sky to the ground."
5-47-33,"Leaving the chariot, wielding the bow and sword, that Aksha the chariot-warrior leapt to the sky. Having a terrible power of penance and leaving his body like a sage, he then was seen departing to heaven because of his Yogic penance."
5-47-34,"Thereafter, Hanuma with his prowess equal to that of wind, approaching Aksha moving in the sky, which is often frequented by Garuda the eagle, the wind and Siddhas the ascetics endowed with supernatural powers, slowly grasped his feet firmly."
5-47-35,"That Hanuma, with a prowess equal to that of wind-god, his father, and the excellent one among monkeys, spigning round Aksha like grasping a great serpent an eagle for a thousand times in the battle, hurled him down to the floor rapidly."
5-47-36,"With his arms, thighs, hips and neck broken, blood dripping, his bones and eyes crushed, his joints displaced and his sinews shattered, that demon was killed by Hanuma."
5-47-37,"Hanuma, having crushed him on the ground, created a great fear to Ravana. Aksha, thus having been killed, Hanuma was gazed on with excessive astonishment by great sages who move everywhere without obstruction and having great voes as also by spirits Yakshas the semidivine beings, Pannagas the serpent-demons and by celestials with Indra the lord of celestials."
5-47-38,"Killing that Aksha, possessing a lustre equal to that of Jayanta the son of Indra the lord of celestials and having his eyes resembling blood, the heroic Hanuma reached the same archy door way again, like Yama the lord of death expecting in a moment any mortal getting destroyed by him."
5-48-1,"Filled with anger on his son Aksha having been killed by Hanuma, yet reconciling his mind, the high-minded Ravana the king of demons for his part then instructed Indrajit (his eldest son) possessing the qualities of god (as follows):"
5-48-2,"You are well acquainted with mystic missiles. You are the foremost among those who are conversant with weapons. You cause anguish even to celestials and demons. Indra and other celestials perceived your performance with your missiles acquired by propitiating Brahma the creator."
5-48-3,"Celestials together with troops of storm-gods joining Indra the lord of celestials were not able to endure the strength of your missiles in battle."
5-48-4,"In a battle against you, every one in the three worlds gets exhausted. You are protected yourself by your great intellect and strong arms. You are guarded by your penance. You are aware of apportioning place and time properly."
5-48-5,"There is nothing impossible for you in your acts of war. With your purposeful thinking, everything is possible for you. There is none in the three worlds, who does not know the force of missiles as also your (physical) strength."
5-48-6,"The strength of your penance as also your prowess and strength in battle resemble mine. Admitting you in the squeeze of battle, my mind does not get fatigues because of the re-assurance."
5-48-7,"All the Kimkaras, a demon called Jambumali, the heroic sons of ministers and the five chiefs of army have been killed, as also the army together with highly abundant number of horses, elephants and chariots."
5-48-8,"Your beloved brother Aksha the prince also has been killed. O annihilator of enemies! The strength which is in me or in you, is indeed not there in them at all."
5-48-9,"O intelligent one! Seeing the great strength, power and prowess of this monkey and keeping in view your own strength, exhibit your valour accordingly."
5-48-10,"Keeping in view your own strength and of the army, O the foremost among those employing missiles, exert yourself in such a way, that further destruction of our army may stop, the moment you, whose enemies have died, have arrived near Hanuma."
5-48-11,"O hero! The armies cannot protect you, even if they are in multitudes. There is no use taking a weapon like a strong thunder bolt against the monkey. There is no limit to the strength of Hanuma the son of wind-god. It is not possible to kill him, who resembles fire, by means of any weapon."
5-48-12,"Perceiving well the fact in this way and with your mind composed by the thought that success can be achieved by your own effort, and remembering the strength of arrows of your wonderful bow, go and duly proceed with your work, without any hindrance."
5-48-13,"This thought of my sending you is not indeed the best option. But, this decision is said to be according to the duties of a king and is the commendation of a warrior-class."
5-48-14,"O destroyer of enemies! You have to learn surely the skill to employ various weapons in battle. You have to aspire for a victory too in battle."
5-48-15,"Hearing the words of his father, Indrajit the strong demon, possessing a power similar to that of gods, with an undepressed mind and with his intellect resolved to fight, performed a circumambulation in honour of Ravana the lord."
5-48-16,"Acclaimed by the beloved people of his own class, Indrajit who was violent in battle then entered the battle-field with an accomplished enthusiasm."
5-48-17,"Indrajit, the illustrious son of Ravana, having eyes like lotus-petals and endowed with extra ordinary energy, rushed forth like an ocean on full-moon days."
5-48-18,"That Indrajit, alike Indra the lord of celestials, ascended a chariot with unchecked speed and yoked with four sharp-toothed tigers, having their swiftness similar to Garuda the king of eagles."
5-48-19,"That Indrajit, the chariot-warrior, best among the wielders of bow, skilled in the use of weapons and excellent among those proficient in the use of missiles, went swiftly in his chariot to where Hanuma was."
5-48-20,"Hearing the rattling sound of Indrajit&#39;s chariot and a twang of his bow, the heroic Hanuma became more thrilled with delight."
5-48-21,"Indrajit, skilled in warfare, taking a very big bow with pointed arrows, went aiming towards Hanuma."
5-48-22,"While that Indrajit who was energetic in battle, was going ahead to the combat, with a bow in his hand, all the quarters became gloomy and ferocious animals howled in many ways."
5-48-23,"Nagas and Yakshas, great sages moving in astronomical circles, Siddhas and a multitude of birds going around the sky, gathered there and clamoured loudly with a great rejoice."
5-48-24,"Seeing Indrajit coming swiftly with the chariot, Hanuma made a noise with great resonance and grew up his body speedily."
5-48-25,"Ascending on his wonderful chariot and wielding a colourful bow, Indrajit on his part, stretched his bow, which made a glaring sound like that accompanying a stroke lightning."
5-48-26,"Those two warriors, Hanuma and Indrajit, possessing great velocity and a great strength as also fearless in combat, confronted in the battle like Indra the Lord of celestials and Ravana the Lord of demons who tightened hostility with each other."
5-48-27,"Hanuma, of immeasurable strength, having expanded his body, aborted the swiftness of arrows of that Indrajit, the great chariot-warrior, the wielder of a bow and well-renowned in battle. Hanuma wheeled about in the path of wind-god, his father."
5-48-28,"Then, the heroic Indrajit, the destroyer of strong enemies, discharged long and sharp-pointed arrows, having beautiful feathers, provided with picturesque golden shafts, with good inclination and as swift as lightning."
5-48-29,"Hearing the rattling sound of the chariot and the sound of wooden tomtoms, kettledrums and war-drums as also the sound of the bow-string being plucked, Hanuma sprang up again."
5-48-30,"Making the total target of Indrajit who was skilled in hitting his target useless, Hanuma the great monkey swiftly wheeled about between the arrows."
5-48-31,"Hanuma, the son of wind-god, again stayed in front of his arrows and stretching out his hands, sprang up."
5-48-32,"Those two warriors, full of swiftness and skilled in their war-fare, staged an excellent battle, which captivated the minds of all beings."
5-48-33,"Indrajit could not know the weakness of Hanuma, nor did Hanuma know the weakness of high-minded Indrajit. Those two warriors, who were equal in prowess to gods, coming into collision with each other, became unbearable to each other."
5-48-34,"The aim of his arrows getting aborted and even his unfailing arrows falling down, the high-minded Indrajit, who was well-known for hitting his target, got hold of a great thought."
5-48-35,"Keeping in view of that monkey being incapable of being slain, Indrajit, Ravana&#39;s son then formed an idea as to how to resort to capture of that Hanuma the chief of monkey-warriors."
5-48-36,"That warrior, Indrajit, excellent among the knowers of missiles and possessing a great splendor, then fitted to his bow, a missile presided over by Brahma the creator."
5-48-37,"Indrajit, who knows the true nature of missiles, feeling certain that he was incapable of being killed, bound that Hanuma, the son of wind-god, by that presided over by Brahma the creator."
5-48-38,"Fastened with the weapon discharged by the demon, Hanuma became motionless and fell down on the ground."
5-48-39,"Realizing that he had been bound by a missile presided over by Brahma the Lord of creation that Hanuma failing to keep his swiftness, considered it to be a favour of Brahma the creator done to him."
5-48-40,"Knowing it to be a missile presided over by Brahma the creator and consecrated by spells sacred to Brahma, the creator, Hanuma then recollected a boon got by Lord Brahma, the grand father of the entire creation."
5-48-41,"I have no capacity to liberate from the bondage of the missile due to the power of Brahma the father of the world. Thus knowing the bondage, through the missile presided over by Brahma the self-born creator imposed by the enemy, it must be obeyed by me."
5-48-42,"Thinking of the potency of the missile and the grace of Brahma, the grandfather of the entire creation enjoyed by him, and thinking about his capacity to liberate from it (which was going to alight on him after a while) that Hanuma obeyed the command of Brahma the grand father of the entire creation."
5-48-43,"Since I am being protected by Brahma, Indra and the wind-god, I do not have fear, eventhough I am fastened by the missile."
5-48-44,"Even if I were captured by the demons, a great advantage is foreseen. There will be a dialogue with Ravana. Therefore, let the enemies capture me."
5-48-45,"That Hanuma, the destroyer of enemies and who acted after fully considering the pros and cons, ascertained his objective and stayed motionless. Approached and captured forcibly by the enemies as also frightened by them, he made a loud scream."
5-48-46,"Seeing that Hanuma, the destroyer of enemies falling motionless, the demons then tied him with plaited chords of hemp and bark of trees."
5-48-47,"Hanuma approved of being forcibly bound and reviled by the enemies, with an assured feeling that Ravana was curious as he was, to see him."
5-48-48,"That powerful Hanuma, tied with those chords of hemp and bark, was relieved of the missile, since the bondage of that missile does not indeed coexist with another bondage."
5-48-49,"Conceiving that Hanuma the foremost among the monkeys, bound with the bark of trees, as having been relieved of the missile, the heroic Indrajit, on his part, then became thoughtful as follows: A person tied with other means cannot indeed be bound again by the missile."
5-48-50,"Alas! My great exploit has been rendered futile. The scope of the mystic formula has not been considered by the demons. Once the spell has been made ineffective, another missile cannot be operative. All of us became jeopardized."
5-48-51,"Hanuma, liberated from the missile being dragged away by the demons and afflicted by the ties of ropes, could not realize that he was liberated from the missile."
5-48-52,"That Hanuma, then being beaten with sticks and fists by the cruel demons, was dragged to the vicinity of Ravana."
5-48-53,"Then, recognizing that Hanuma, tied with barks of trees and ropes, but liberated by the missile, Indrajit slowed that mighty Hanuma the jewel among the monkeys, to Ravana there sitting along with a body of his attendants."
5-48-54,"The demons showed to Ravana, the king of demons that captured Hanuma, the jewel among the foremost of monkeys who looked like an elephant in rut."
5-48-55,"So went round the following conversations from the heroic demons there: Who is this being? Whose savant is he? Where has he come from? What is his pursuit? Who is his alley?"
5-48-56,"Thereafter, some demons, highly enraged, said to one another as follows: Let this monkey be killed, even roasted alive and devoured."
5-48-57,"After crossing over the path swiftly, the high-souled Hanuma saw there the palace of Ravana, decorated with highly precious stones and his elderly attendants sitting at the feet of Ravana."
5-48-58,"That Ravana, who was endowed with an extraordinary energy, saw Hanuma the foremost of monkeys, being dragged hither and thither by demons of ugly countenance."
5-48-59,"Hanuma the jewel among the monkeys also saw Ravana the king of demons, charged with luster and strength and blazing like the sun."
5-48-60,"That Ravana, rolling his red-hot eyes with rage by seeing that Hanuma and thereafter seeing his important ministers who were elder to his by clan and character sitting there, ordered them to interrogate Hanuma."
5-48-61,"Questioned, as per order, by those ministers as to the purpose of his operation and the motive of his act, that Hanuma at the outset informed, I came from Sugreeva as an envoy."
5-49-1,"Then, Hanuma with a terrific prowess, was enraged (at his capture and his being dragged) and saw Ravana with his red hot eyes. He was surprised by that deed of Indrajit."
5-49-2,"Ravana was endowed with a great splendor and shone with a glittering and precious diadem of gold as also encircled with strings of pearls."
5-49-3,"That Ravana was adorned with bright-coloured gold ornaments, inlaid with diamonds and decorated with worthy gems, which appeared as though they were prepared with the mind."
5-49-4,"Ravana was attired in very costly silk and his body was smeared with red-sandal paste and well painted with various brightly coloured designs."
5-49-5,"Ravana looked strange with his ten heads, having terrible-looking yet good-looking pair of red eyes each, with brilliant sharp enormous teeth and protruding lips, like a daring demon endowed with extra ordinary vigour, shining brightly as Mount Mandara with its peaks and infested with snakes of different varieties."
5-49-6,"Ravana was having a pearl necklace casting its splendor on his bosom. He was looking like a mass of blue antimony, but with his countenance shining like the full moon and appearing like a cloud illumined by the rising sun."
5-49-7,"Ravana was distinguished by (twenty) arms, adorned with bracelets, smeared with excellent sandal-paste and decked with shining Angadas another variety of bracelets and looking like large five-hooded serpents."
5-49-8,"He was comfortably seated on a big excellent throne of crystal, rendered picturesque by being embedded with jewels and overspread with an exquisite covering."
5-49-9,"He was duly waited upon at close quarters on all sides by young ladies, well-adorned and with whisks in their hands."
5-49-10,"He was proud of his might and had four counselors sitting nearby, all belonging to the demonical race and who knew the secret of good counsel, viz. Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparshva the demon and the counselor Nikumbha and looked like the entire terrestrial globe enclosed by four oceans."
5-49-11,"He was being reassured by counselors knowing the secret of good counsel and other demons with auspicious minds, as Indra the lord of celestials is reassured by celestials."
5-49-12,"Hanuma saw Ravana with a great splendor, sitting on the throne, looking like a rainy cloud on the peak of Mount Meru."
5-49-13,"Though tortured by the demons that Hanuma, of terrific prowess, experiencing a great surprise, looked attentively at Ravana."
5-49-14,"Seeing the glittering Ravana, the king of demons, Hanuma was bewildered by his splendor and thought in his mind as follows:"
5-49-15,"What figure, what courage, what strength, what splendor and what amalgam of auspicious marks, alas, this king of demons has!"
5-49-16,"Had this lord of demons perhaps not strong in unrighteousness, he would have been a protector of even the world of celestials together with Indra the lord of celestials."
5-49-17,"By his cruel and violent acts despised by the world, all people including gods and demons indeed remain frightened of him. If enraged he is indeed capable to turn the entire world into a single ocean."
5-49-18,"Seeing the power of Ravana the king of demons, who possessed an unlimited vigour, the intelligent Hanuma formulated many kinds of thoughts in this way."
5-50-1,"That Ravana, the long-armed, who caused people to cry, looking up at that monkey standing in front of him, was affected with violent anger, having his mind seized with suspicion, speculated (as follows) about Hanuma, the jewel among the monkeys, who was invested with splendour."
5-50-2,"When Mount Kailasa was moved by me, is it the same Nandi the divine bull (attendant of Siva) which cursed me long ago and came here now in this form or whether he is Bana the great demon (son of Bali) came here in the form of a monkey."
5-50-3,"That king Ravana, becoming enraged with red hot eyes, spoke the following concise and meaningful words relevant to that occasion, to Prahasta, his chief of ministers."
5-50-4,"Ask this wicked monkey from where did he come, for what reason did he come to this place and for what purpose did he frighten the female-demons in destroying our garden."
5-50-5,"Ask this evil-minded monkey as to what really is his purpose in coming over to my invincible City and what pursuit he is doing this battle."
5-50-6,"Hearing the words of Ravana, Prahasta spoke the following words to Hanuma, Take courage! Happiness to you! You need not get frightened, O monkey!"
5-50-7,"O monkey! If Indra has sent you to the abode of Ravana, tell me the truth. Do not have fear. You will be released."
5-50-8,"Are you, the one who has entered our city, assuming the guise of a spy, sent by Kubera the god of riches or by Yama the god of death or by Varuna the lord of the sea or whether sent by Vishnu the lord of preservation, as a messenger, longing for a victory?"
5-50-9,"O monkey! Your form alone is that of a monkey. Your splendour indeed is not that of a monkey. Now, tell me the truth. Thereupon, you will be released."
5-50-10,"If you tell a lie, your survival will be difficult. Or else, tell me the purpose of your entry into Ravana&#39;s abode."
5-50-11,"Hearing the words of Prahasta, Hanuma spoke to Ravana the Lord of demons as follows, I am not a messenger of Indra or Yama or Varuna. I have no friendship with Kubera the god of riches, nor am I instigated by Vishnu. This is just my form of existence, by my very birth. I am a monkey who came here."
5-50-12,"The sight of Ravana the King of demons is difficult to be obtained. Intent on that object (of sight of Ravana), the garden was destroyed by me."
5-50-13,"Then, those strong demons came with a desire to fight with me. Just for protecting my body, I had to attack them in battle."
5-50-14,"I am incapable of being bound by missiles and nooses even by celestials and demons. This boon came to me also from Brahama only."
5-50-15,"With a desire to see you the king, I surrendered to the missile. Soon after bound by the demons, I was indeed released from the missile. I came to your presence, prompted by some mission of Rama."
5-50-16,"O, Lord of demons! Know me to be a messenger of Rama who is possessing I am unlimited splendour. I am telling you a beneficial word. Listen to it."
5-51-1,"Seeing that highly energetic Ravana, the courageous Hanuma coolly spoke to him the following meaningful words:"
5-51-2,"O king of demons! By the command of Sugreeva, I came here to your abode. Sugreeva, the Lord of monkeys, your brother, asked me to enquire about your welfare."
5-51-3,"Hear the righteous and meaningful words, as a following advice, of the high-souled Sugreeva, your brother, conducive to good in the world as well as in the other world."
5-51-4,"There was a king named Dasaratha, having chariots, elephants and horses, like a father to the people and endowed with a splendour equal to that of Indra the lord of celestials."
5-51-5,"His eldest son named Rama, having mighty arms, a bestower of affection and our lord, by the command of his father, abiding in a righteous path, went out on exile and entered a forest called Dandaka along with Lakshmana his brother and Seetha his wife."
5-51-6,"Seetha, wife of Rama, devoted to her husband and daughter of the high-souled king, named Janaka, the head of Videha kingdom, got lost in the forest."
5-51-7,"That prince, Rama together with his brother, searching that lady, reached Mount Rishyamuka and happened to meet Sugreeva."
5-51-8,"While Sugreeva promised Rama to get Seetha searched, Rama too promised to get the kingdom of monkeys to Sugreeva."
5-51-9,"Thereafter, killing Vali in a combat, Rama installed Sugreeva on the throne as a lord of that troop monkeys and bears."
5-51-10,"You may indeed know Vali, the foremost among monkeys, previously. Rama killed that Vali with a single arrow in battle."
5-51-11,"Sugreeva, the lord of monkeys, true to his promise, was intent on searching for Seetha and sent his monkeys to all directions."
5-51-12,"Hundreds, thousands and lakhs of monkeys are searching for her in all quarters, as also below and above in the sky."
5-51-13,"Among those monkeys, some mighty and virile monkeys are similar to Garuda the eagle. Some are like wind, swiftly going with an unhindered movement."
5-51-14,"I am, however, an own son of wind-god and named as Hanuma. I came here even by crossing quickly the ocean, which is a hundred yojanas (or eight hundred miles) wide for the sake of Seetha and wishing to see her."
5-51-15,"While strolling around in the city of Lanka, I found Seetha in your abode. You know about religious merit and wealth. You performed and mastered the austerities. That is why, you ought not besiege the wife of another, O great intellectual!"
5-51-16,"Intellectuals like you indeed are not engrossed in acts, which are antagonistic to righteousness, which are attended with many dangers and which even ruin the doer at the roots."
5-51-17,"Who is capable even among celestials and demons, to withstand the arrows discharged by Lakshmana, in the wake of the fury of Rama?"
5-51-18,"O king! No one is known in the three worlds, who have gained happiness, by doing harm to Rama."
5-51-19,"That is why, accede to my words, which are beneficial for all the three divisions of time (viz. the past, present and future), resulting in affluence and respectability as well. Let Seetha be restored to Rama."
5-51-20,"I beheld Seetha, the princess. The audience of Seetha is difficult to be achieved and it is obtained here. It is for Rama there to decide his remaining task of future consequence."
5-51-21,"Capturing Seetha, whom you do not recognize as a five-hooded female serpent in your abode, has been found by me in that manner, and wholly given over to sorrow."
5-51-22,"She is incapable of being devoured with one&#39;s might even by celestials and demons, any more than food mixed with abundant poison could be digested with one&#39;s digestive power, if consumed."
5-51-23,"It is not proper for you to lose your exceptional longevity and that fortune which is an outcome of your virtue, both of which have been acquired by you through the practice of austerities."
5-51-24,"You may be thinking that you are immune from death from demons and celestials, because of your austerities. But your opinion in that matter is not correct, on account of the following reason."
5-51-25,"This Sugreeva is indeed neither a god, nor Asura the chief of evil spirits nor a demon nor a child of Danu the demon, nor Gandharva the celestial musician nor Yaksha the semi-divine being nor pannaga the serpent-demon. O King! How do you protect your life from him?"
5-51-26,"The fruit of righteousness does not exist together with the result of unrighteousness (eventhough he practices virtue). That consequence of unrighteousness alone follows him. Righteousness in abundance destroys unrighteousness."
5-51-27,"You already obtained the fruit of virtue till now. There is no doubt about it. In no time, you will obtain the fruit of unrighteousness also."
5-51-28,"Recognizing the killing of demons in the forest of Janasthana, about the killing of Vali and about the friendship between Rama and Sugreeva, realize your own interest."
5-51-29,"I am indeed, even alone, undoubtedly, destroying Lanka, along with its horses, chariots and elephants. However, this is not in accordance with the resolution of Rama."
5-51-30,"For, Rama, indeed, promised in the presence of troops of monkeys and bears, about the extermination of enemies, by whom Seetha was actually laid violent hands upon."
5-51-31,"Even Indra the Lord of celestials, in person, cannot attain happiness if he does any harm to Rama. How much move to another person like you?"
5-51-32,"Know her, whom you recognize as Seetha and who stays in your captivity, to be none else than Kalaratri (the goddess presiding over and responsible for dissolution), who can destroy the entire Lanka."
5-51-33,"Therefore, have it enough of this noose of death, in the form of Seetha&#39;s personality, which has been placed by yourself around your neck. Think well of your safety."
5-51-34,"See; (in the immediate future), this city of Lanka, burnt away by the effulgence of Seetha and the City too being scorched with its markets and main streets, afflicted by the wrath of Rama."
5-51-35,"Do not lead to extermination your own friends, counsellors, kinsmen, brothers, sons, well-wishers, enjoyments, wives and Lanka."
5-51-36,"O king of demons! Listen to my truthful words coming as it is from the lips of this servant of Rama, his messenger and particularly of this monkey."
5-51-37,"The renowned Rama is capable of totally destroying all the worlds together with its five elements, along with its animate and inanimate things and also to create yet again all the worlds in like manner as before."
5-51-38,"The renowned Rama, who is equal in prowess to Vishnu the lord of the preservation and among celestials, demons or the foremost of men, or among hordes of Yakshas the semi-divine beings or ogres or among all Vidyadharas, a king of super-natural beings or among Gandharvas the celestials musicians or among Uragas the semi-divine serpents or among Siddhas the holy personages having super-natural powers or among excellent Kinnaras the mythical beings with human figure and head of a horse or among all types of birds or among all living beings at all places and at all times."
5-51-39,"After doing a great harm in this manner to Rama the lord of all worlds as well as the lion among kings, your survival will be difficult."
5-51-40,"O king of demons! Either celestials or demons or Gandharvas the celestial musicians or Vidyadharas a king of super-natural beings or Nagas the semi-divine serpents or Yakshas the semi divine beings-all of them are not able to stand before Rama the lord of the three worlds."
5-51-41,"Either Brahma the self-existing god with four faces or Rudra with three eyes and the destroyer of Tripura (the city built of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth, by Maya for the demons and burnt by Shiva), or Mahendra the god of atmosphere and sky as also the lord of celestials would not be able to protect the one to be killed by Rama in battle."
5-51-42,"Hearing those unpleasant words endowed with extreme skillfulness and which were spoken without fear from Hanuma, that unequalled Ravana ordered for the killing of that Hanuma."
5-52-1,"Hearing those words of the high=souled Hanuma, Ravana duly excited with anger, ordered for the killing of Hanuma."
5-52-2,"While it was ordered by the evil-natured Ravana for the killing of Hanuma, Vibhishana did not agree to the killing of Hanuma, who was entrusted with the functions of a messenger."
5-52-3,"Seeing Ravana getting enraged and looking to that affair (of killing of an envoy) that has arisen, Vibhishana who was firm in accompanying any object, reflected upon an appropriate action to be done."
5-52-4,"Then, deciding about a right action, Vibhishna, who was silled in communication and a conqueror of enemies, spoke softly the following very meaningful and useful words to Ravana, his venerable borther."
5-52-5,"O king of demons! Forgive and give up your anger. Be gracious and hear my words. Virtuous kings of excellence, knowing the distant and the near, do not cause killing of an envoy."
5-52-6,"O hero! Killing of this monkey is against a royal virtue and any universal custom condemns it. Hence, it is improper for you also to do it."
5-52-7,"You are indeed the knower of what is right. You are a person of gratitude. You are well-versed in royal virtues. You know both the distant and the near in beings. You know the highest truth."
5-52-8,"If even learned persons like you are seized by anger, then the knowledge of scriptures is indeed just a labour in vain."
5-52-9,"O king of demons! O annihilator of enemies, dangerous to be approached! Therefore, be graceful. After ascertaining about right and wrong, let appropriate punishment be ordered to the envoy."
5-52-10,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Ravana the lord of demons was greatly enraged and replied in the following words:"
5-52-11,"O Vibhishana, the annihilator of enemies! There is no sin, even if the sinners are killed. So, I shall kill this monkey, who performed sins."
5-52-12,"Hearing those words, rooted in unrighteousness, enveloped in a great anger and accepted by the dishonourable, Vibhishana the best among those who weer endowed with understanding, spoke the following words, comprising of the highest truth."
5-52-13,"O king of demons! O lord of Lanka! Be gracious enough. Hear my words endowed with righteousness and significance. O king! Sages say that messengers should not be killed at all places and at all times."
5-52-14,"There is no doubt that this enemy is arrogant. He has created an unlimited displeasure to us. But, sages do not talk about the killing of an envoy There are indeed severeal punishments, intended for an envoy."
5-52-15,"Some of the punishments to an envoy are-deforming the limbs, striking with a whip, shaving the head and impressing marks on the body. Indeed, we have not heard at any time of killing a messenger."
5-52-16,"How can a person like you, holding an intellect trained in religious merit and purpose and a right judgement on cause and effect, subject to anger? Wise people indeed contain their anger."
5-52-17,"O hero! There is no one equal to you, who can discuss about the law or duty, none about universal custom and none in capturing the essence of scriptures. You are indeed excellent among all the celestials and demons in these matter."
5-52-18,"O king of demons! You are valiant. You are heroic. Even celestials and demons cannot conquer you. You conquered a multitude of proud celestials and demons together with their kings in battles several times"
5-52-19,"I do not see any merit in killing this monkey. Let this carnal punishment be employed on those by whom this monkey was sent."
5-52-20,"He is a person, sent by our enemies, whether he is good or bad. It is not worthy of killing him, who is an envoy, who is dependent on others and who talks for the cause of others."
5-52-21,"O king! Moreover, If he is killed, I do not find any other person, who can travel through the sky and come here again to this shore of the great ocean."
5-52-22,"O conqueror of enemies! Therefore, do not make efforts to kill him. On the other hand, you ought to strengthen such effort on celestials including indra."
5-52-23,"O Ravana, who is fond of war! If he is dead, I do not find any other hero, who can incite those two arrogant princes, who are hindered by a long distance, for war."
5-52-24,"O Ravana who can gladden the hearts of demons! It is not proper for you, who are difficult to be conquered by even celestials and demons having sufficient prowess energy and courage, to crush the arrival of a war."
5-52-25,"There are more than a crore of valiant warriors in your charge, well-maintained, who desire your welfare, quite devoted, having colossal merits, born in a good tribe, holding high spirits and excellent wielders of weapons."
5-52-26,"Therefore, let some who follow your command, by talking a portion of your army, subjugate those two stupid princes, in order to make your power known to your adversaries."
5-52-27,"Ravana, the mighty and the eminent king of demons as also the lord of ogres and the adversary of the world of celestials, understood the cherished and excellent message of Vibhishana his brother with his due presence of mind."
5-53-1,"Hearing those words, which were aprropriate for that place and time, spoken by that hih-souled Vibhishana, his brother, Ravana spoke the following words in reply:"
5-53-2,"You have spoken well indeed that killing of an envoy is forbidden. Another punishment other than killing needs be certainly meted out to him."
5-53-3,"It is said that a tail is possibly a beloved ornament for the monkeys. Let his tail be burn immediately. Let him go with a burnt tail."
5-53-4,"Let all his relatives together with his friends, kinsmen and amicable persons then see him miserably injured with his deformed limbs."
5-53-5,"Ravana ordered that let the monkey be carried around with his burning tail by the demons in the entire city around its cross-roads."
5-53-6,"Hearing those words of Ravana, the demons, hard-tempered with their wrath, wrapped, up old ragged clothes around Hanuma&#39;s tail."
5-53-7,"While his tail was being wrapped around with cotton tatters, Hanuma proliferating, soon after catching dry wood in forests."
5-53-8,"The demons sprinkled oil and set out fire on that tail. Then, Hanuma, with his face resembling a rising sun with his mind filled with anger and impatience and with his burning tail, threw those demons down."
5-53-9,"To see the burning tail of that Hanuma, the delighted demons together with their women, chldren and elders went there."
5-53-10,"Tied down again by the cruel demons, coming together, the heroic Hanuma the foremost among monkeys made up his mind appropriate for that occasion (as follows):"
5-53-11,"Though I have been tied down, those demons cannot do whatever they wish to do against me. Breaking the ties, I can fly up and kill them."
5-53-12,"If these evil-minded demons fasten me who is acting for the good of Rama my lord, because of the command by their lord, no rebuff has been done to me."
5-53-13,"I am adequate enough to kill all these demons in battle. But, for the delight of Rama, such city of Lanka is fit to be espionaged again. For this reason, I am putting up with it."
5-53-14,"Lanka was not indeed observed well as to the particulars of specifications of the fort, when it was seen by me during the night. Surely, it is to be seen by me during the day-time."
5-53-15,"Let the demons tie me down of again and torment me as they wish, by burning my tail. There will be no travail to my mind."
5-53-16,"Then, those delighted demons went, seizing Hanuma, who concealed all types of his feelings, who was strong and foremost among monkeys."
5-53-17,"Sounding couches and kettle-drums and proclaining the acts of Hanuma like his damaging of the pleasure-garden, the demons performing terrible deeds, dragged Hanuma through out that city."
5-53-18,"Accompanied by demons, Hanuma the annihilator of enemies, went happily and roamed about in that great city of demons."
5-53-19,"Then, Hanuma saw some wonderful house some wrapped up plots of land and well parted cross ways."
5-53-20,"Hanuma, the son of wind-god, saw streets congested with dwellings, places where several roads meet, high-ways as also approach-roads, small inner apartments and palaces appearing in multitudes, like clouds."
5-53-21,"All the demons proclaimed in cross roads, four-pillared temples and in royal high-ways, saying that Hanuma was a spy."
5-53-22,"Women, children and old people came out from their respective dwellings, with an eagerness to see that Hanuma with his burning tail."
5-53-23,"While the tip of Hanuma&#39;s tail was being ignited by the demons there, those female-demons with monstrous eyes then informed that unpleasant matter to Seetha, the princess."
5-53-24,"O Seetha! That monkey with a red face, who had a conversation with you, is being moved around in the city, with his ignited tail."
5-53-25,"Hearing that cruel news, which created as much sorrow as when she was carried away by Ravana, Seetha was tormented with grief and started to pay homage to the fire-god."
5-53-26,"Then, the large-eyed Seetha, wishing for the welfare of Hanuma, prayed the fire-god with her devoted self."
5-53-27,"If I have done any service to my husband, if I have performed a penance and if I am a faithful wife, please be cool to Hanuma."
5-53-28,"If the wise Rama has even a little of kindness to me and if I have still some good fortune remaining to my credit, please be cool to Hanuma."
5-53-29,"If that virtuous Rama recognises me as one,, who is endowed with a good moral conduct and who is ardently desirous of meeting him, please be cool to Hanuma."
5-53-30,"If the venerable Sugreeva, true to his promise, can make me traverse from this ocean of sorrow, please be cool to Hanuma."
5-53-31,"Then, the fire-god, as though informing the fawn-eyed Seetha about the well-being of Hanuma, shone brightly with sharp flames, undisteurbed and shooting out pointed flames towards the right."
5-53-32,"Even wind-god, the father of Hanuma, combined with the fire on Hanuma&#39;s tail, swept coolly like a snow-breeze, creating a solace to Seetha."
5-53-33,"While his tail was in flames, Hanuma was reflecting why the fire, which was blazing on all sides, was not burning him."
5-53-34,"It is conspicuous with large flames. But it is not creating any paoin to me, as if a snow-ball is kept at the tip of my tail."
5-53-35,"Or, while I was jumping over the ocean, a surprise-alliance was formed with Mount Mainaka and through the mountain, with the ocean, because of Rama&#39;s power. By this, the reason of the coolness is clear."
5-53-36,"If such an eagerness was there in the mind of the sea and the wise Mount Mainaka for the cause of Rama; will not the fire-god show the same degree of eagerness in making its touch cold?"
5-53-37,"The fire does not burn me, due to kindness of Seetha, powerfulness of Rama and friendlines of my father."
5-53-38,"That Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, reflected agian for a monment, jumped with swiftness and roared too."
5-53-39,"Then, the glorious Hanuma like a mountain-peak, approached the city-gate, which was looking high and stood secluded from the crowds of demons."
5-53-40,"That prudent Hanuma assumed the form of a mountain and immediately within a moment, assumed an exceedingly short form, thus becoming free from his tethers."
5-53-41,"The glorious Hanuma, having been free from his bonds, again assumed the form equal to a mountain and while looking around, found and iron rod belonging to the arched door-way."
5-53-42,"That long-armed Hanuma, again taking taht rod made of iron, killed all those guards."
5-53-43,"That Hanuma, having an impetuous valour in combat, destroying those demons and looking over Lanka, shone like the sun encircled with rays, with the wreath of flames blazing on his tail."
5-54-1,"Then, after fulfilling his heart&#39;s wish, Hanuma, looking over Lanka, thought about the remaining act to be done, with an augmented energy."
5-54-2,"Which act indeed is remaing nowto be done by me here, that may further create anguish to these demons?"
5-54-3,"I have demolished the garden. I have killed excellent demons. I destroyed a portion of the army. The demolition of the fort is still remaining."
5-54-4,"When the fort gets destroyed, the task (of Rama&#39;s battle) will be devoid of fatigue. Even with a small effort in this task, the work will become fruitful."
5-54-5,"It is justified to satisfy this blazing flame on my tail, by feeding it to the full, with these excellent houses (in the city of Lanka)."
5-54-6,"Then, Hanuma, with his burning tail, strolled over the house-tops of Lanka, like a cloud charged with lightning."
5-54-7,"Surveying the gardens and lofty palatial mansions, that Hanuma, without fear, passed from one house to another, of the demons."
5-54-8,"Jumping down on Prahasta&#39;s house, the valiant Hanuma, with great swiftness, having strength equal to wind, scattering fire on it, jumped over from there, to another house belonging to Mahaparsva. Hanuma, with great swiftness, having strength equal to wind, scattering fire on it, jumped over from there, to another house belonging to Mahaparsva. Hanuma scattered a fire there resembling a flame of fire that is to destroy the world."
5-54-9,"That Hanuma, of great splendour, then leapt to the houses of Vajradamshtra, Shuka and Sarana, the intelligent."
5-54-10,"Leaving the house of Vibhishana, Hanuma of great splendour, went successively to the houses of Rashmiketu, Surya shatru, Hrasvakarna, Damshtra, Romasha the demon, Yuddhonmatta, Matta, Dhvajagreeva the demon, the terrific Vidyujjihva, Hastimukha, Karala, Pishacha, Shonitaaksha, Kumbhakarna, Makaraksha, Yajnashatru, Brahmashatru, Narantaka, Kumbha as also the evil-minded Nikumbha and burnt the houses."
5-54-11,"That Hanuma of great fame burnt away wealth in the mansions of the rich."
5-54-12,"Having passed over all the houses, the mighty and glorious Hanuma thereafter approached the house of Ravana the king of demons."
5-54-13,"Thereafter, scattering a blazing fire located at the tip of his tail, on that principal house, decorated with various kinds of precious stones, resembling Mounts Meru and Mandara as also embellished with all good work, the valiant Hanuma roared like a cloud thundering at noon-time in a rainy season."
5-54-14,"In contact with the wind, the fire escalated with a great speed and intensity, blazing like a fire that is to destroy the world."
5-54-15,"The wind carried the blazing fire to other houses. In conjunction with the wind, the fire became very swift."
5-54-16,"Those large houses, with golden windows, embedded with pearls, gems and precious jewels were shattered to pieces."
5-54-17,"The demons, who were running hither and thither to protect their houses and who lost their spirits and abundant wealth, created a tumultuous nose, saying Alas! The fire-god has come really in a form of this monkey!"
5-54-18,"Some women crying and carrying their suckling&#39;s with their hair dishevelled, fell down from their houses, which were enveloped with fire, and shone like flashes of lightning falling from clouds in the sky."
5-54-19,"That Hanuma saw molten metals mixed with diamonds, corals, cat&#39;s eye-gems, pearls and silver, surging from every marvellous house."
5-54-20,"As the fire does not get satisfied with any amount of firewood and straw fed to it, Hanuma was not wearied in killing any number of demons. The earth was not then wearied in receiving the number of demons killed by Hanuma (in her lap)."
5-54-21,"Flames of fire glittered like Kimshuka flowers at some places, blossoms of Shalmali tree at some places and like saffron-flowers at some other places."
5-54-22,"The high souled Hanuma, the swift monkey scorched the city of Lanka, as Rudra scorched the city of Tripura."
5-54-23,"Then, the fire having a terrific prowess, diffused by the swift Hanuma, stretching out a circle of flames, blazed and rose up to the summit of the mountain on which the city of Lanka."
5-54-24,"That fire diffused on those buildings, together with the wind picked up a speed equal to that of a fire at the time of dissolution of the world. It grew taller, touching the sky with a smokeless splendour. Those flames of fire shot up, as inflamed by ghee"
5-54-25,"The great fire persisted, surrounding the entire Lanka, having a good splendour equal to that of millions of suns and blazed like a broken-up hemi-sphere of the world, creating many sounds of a wide-spread thunderbolt."
5-54-26,"The fire with a fierce splendour there, extended fully to the sky, shooting flames like Kumshuka flowers. The clouds, bearing the colour of blue lotuses, shone as covered by smoke formed out of the extinguished fire."
5-54-27,"He is not a monkey. He is either Indra the Lord of celestials wielding a thunderbolt, or Yama the lord of death of water, or the wind-god or the fire seated in the third eye of Lord Shiva or the sun-god or Kubera the lord of riches or the moon-god. He may be Kala (the Time-spirit) himself."
5-54-28,"Whether the rage of four-faced Brahma, the grand father of all and the creator of all has arrived here in the guise of a monkey, playing the role of a destroyer of demons?"
5-54-29,"Or whether a supreme bright energy of Vishnu, the lord of maintenance of the Universe, unthinkable, unmanifest, infinite and pearless, arrived now, assuming the form of a monkey for the destruction of demons, by virtue of Her extraordinary power?"
5-54-30,"Thus spoke all those excellent troops of demons in multitude, gathering together there, on seeing that city scorched so soon, with its host of living beings, houses and trees."
5-54-31,"Then, Lanka having been scorched with its demons, horses, chariots, elephants, multitude of birds, animals and trees, cried pitiably with tumultuous noise."
5-54-32,"Making a very terrific noise with a dreadful sound, the demons cried in various ways as follows: O my dear beloved son! O my beloved husband! O my friend! O my very auspicious life, filled with enjoyments!"
5-54-33,"That Lanka appeared as though afflicted by a curse, as defeated by a strong fury of Hanuma, enveloped by flames of fire, with its distinguished heroes killed and with its warriors in retreat."
5-54-34,"Hanuma, with his great mind, saw Lanka with its dazed, frightened and dejected demons, marked by blazing flames of fire and afflicted by the fury of Brahma the creator of the universe."
5-54-35,"After demolishing the garden which was full of excellent trees, killing great demons in battle and burning that city endowed with a series of excellent houses, Hanuma the monkey and the son of wind-god, stood at ease."
5-54-36,"Standing there on the wonderful flat summit of Mount Trikuta, Hanuma the foremost leader of the monkeys, having a garland of flames formed by his blazing tail, shone like the sun having a garland of rays."
5-54-37,"Killing those multitudes of demons, demolishing that garden endowed with several trees and scattering fire on the houses of demons, the high-souled Hanuma sought Rama with his mind."
5-54-38,"Then, all the multitude of celestials enlogised that Hanuma, the principal warrior of the monkeys, possessing great strength and swiftness similar to the wind, greatly intelligent and the most excellent."
5-54-39,"Demolishing the garden, killing the demons in battle, Hanuma of great splendour shone brightly, after burning the beautiful City of Lanka."
5-54-40,"Seeing that city of Lanka burnt there, celestials, saints and great sages along with celestial&#39;s musicians, got a colossal surprise."
5-54-41,"Seeing that Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys and a mighty monkey, all the created beings were frightened, thinking of him as a fire that is to destroy the world."
5-54-42,"There, all the celestial musicians, Vidyadharas the supernatural beings, Nagas the celestial serpents, Yakshas the spirits and all great living beings attained a great joy."
5-55-1,"Seeing the city of Lanka blazing, and frightened with its multitude of demons getting alarmed, Hanuma the monkey became thoughtful."
5-55-2,"A great anxiety entered his mind and there arose in him a feeling of self-contempt. He said to himself What an admonitory act has bee done by me in burning Lanka."
5-55-3,"As a burning fire is extinguished with water, blessed indeed are those great-souled men of excellence, who in their wisdom, restrain their elevated fury."
5-55-4,"Which enraged man would not incur a sinful act? An enraged person may even kill his elders. An enraged person may insult virtuous men with harsh words."
5-55-5,"An agitated person ever does not know which appropriate words are and which are forbidden words to be uttered. For enraged persons, there is neither an improper act nor ever an improper word to be spoken."
5-55-6,"As a serpent casts off its slough, whoever casts aside an intense anger sprung up in him suddenly by virtue of his endurance, he verily is said to be an excellent man."
5-55-7,"Shame be upon me, the greatest sinner with utter foolishness and impudence, who became a fire-brand without giving thought to that Seetha and became hurtful to my master."
5-55-8,"If this whole Lanka for its part has been burnt, the worshipful Seetha too has surely been burnt. Thus, I have spolt the purpose of my lord inadvertently."
5-55-9,"That purpose for which all this effort was taken, has been spoilt. At the time of burning the city, I have not saved Seetha indeed."
5-55-10,"This task (of burning Lanka) has been fulfilled by me and it has been completed only with a small effort. Overpowered as I was with anger, the very root of that fulfillment has been destroyed by me. There is no doubt."
5-55-11,"The entire Lanka has been reduced to ashes. No place is seen unburnt in this City. Therefore, Seetha also must have been surely lost."
5-55-12,"If this task has been spoiled due to my perverted intelligence, it is appropriate even for me, here and now itself, to give up my life."
5-55-13,"Shall I jump into fire now or into the mouth of a submarine fire? Or shall I give up my body as a feed to the marine animals?"
5-55-14,"By me who has ruined the entire task, how can I, even while remaining alive, see Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys or Rama and Lakshmana the best of men?"
5-55-15,"Due to culpability of my anger, I have indeed shown this apishness that is famous for instability in the three worlds."
5-55-16,"Let there be shame upon the passionate way of my thinking, which breeds helplessness and instability. fir, eventhough capable as I am, Seetha could not be saved by me due to my exciting passion of anger."
5-55-17,"If Seetha dies, those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana will die. If their death occurs, Sugreeva along with his associates will also die."
5-55-18,"How can the virtuous Bharata together with Shatrughna, who are affectionate to his brother, survive after hearing this news?"
5-55-19,"When the virtuous Ikshvaku dynasty perishes, all the people will undoubtedly be tormented with anguish and affliction."
5-55-20,"Therefore, I, the unfortunate being, deprived of the values of duty and interest, with my mind filled with culpability of anger, clearly became the destroyer of the world."
5-55-21,"While thinking thus, Hanuma clearly saw some omens, whose welcome-results had already been directly experienced by him and again thought (as follows);"
5-55-22,"Or else, Seetha the auspicious lady, who is completely charming of her limbs and protected by her own effulgence, does not get destroyed. Fire does not indeed destroy fire!"
5-55-23,"If this fire with its burning nature is not igniting me, it is surely due to the power of Rama and the benevolence of Seetha."
5-55-24,"How should that Seetha, who is a godhead for the three brothers (of Rama) starting with Bharata and who is dear to the heart of Rama perish?"
5-55-25,"This fire, which spreads everywhere without any hindrance, is not burning my tail. How can it burn the venerable Seetha?"
5-55-26,"Hanuma then recalled with wonder the sight of Mount Mainaka (having gold in its cavities) in the midst of sea-water there."
5-55-27,"That Seetha can even burn away the fire by her penance, true utterances and undivided devotion towards her husband. Fire does not ignite her."
5-55-28,"Hanuma, who was thus thinking there about the overpowering virtue of Seetha, happened to hear the words of the high-souled charanas (heavenly bards)."
5-55-29,"Alas! Hanuma, who hurled a very terrific fire into Ravana&#39;s house, has indeed done a difficult act."
5-55-30,"The city of Lanka, full of demons their wives, children and elders running hither and thither, as also filled with an uproar of people, appears as if it weeping through its mountain-caves."
5-55-31,"It is just so surprising a marvel to us that the entire City with its market-places, ramparts and arched door-ways, was burnt, but Seetha alone was not burnt."
5-55-32,"That Hanuma became delighted in his mind, by seeing the omens, with their apparent advantages in them and very high qualities of their origin as also the words of those sages."
5-55-33,"Then, Hanuma, having fulfilled his object of desire by learning that Seetha the princess remains uninjured, made up his mind to return only after seeing her personally yet again."
5-56-1,"Thereafter, having offered his salutation to Seetha, who was present at the foot of Ashoka tree, Hanuma spoke: Thank heaven! I am seeing you uninjured here!"
5-56-2,"Then, beholding again and again, that Hanuma, who had made ready for his return journey, Seetha spoke the following words, filled with affection towards her husband."
5-56-3,"O Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies! You are yourself surely sufficient single-handed completion of this task. Your elevated energy is creditable indeed."
5-56-4,"But, it will be appropriate for Rama, who destroys the hostile forces, to take me with him, after routing Lanka with his arrows."
5-56-5,"Therefore, you act in such a way that the high-souled Rama, valiant in battle, may exhibit prowess worthy of him."
5-56-6,"Hearing those humble, reasonable and meaningful words of Seetha, Hanuma spoke the following words in reply."
5-56-7,"Rama, accompanied by the leaders of monkeys and bears, will come soon and after conquering the enemies in battle, will take away your grief."
5-56-8,"Hanuma, the son of wind-god, thus consoling Seetha and making up his mind to go, saluted Seetha with reverence."
5-56-9,"Thereafter, that Hanuma the foremost among the monkeys, and the annihilator of enemies, with an anxious desire to see his lord, ascended the Mount Arishta of excellence."
5-56-10,"That mountain was covered as it were with dark green rows of gardens inhabited by towery elephants with red spots on their skin and with its clouds hanging between its summits, as with an upper garment."
5-56-11,"By metals scattered here and there, looking like eyes drawing up the eye-lids, the mountain looked like being awakened, as it were, with love by the bright rays of the sun."
5-56-12,"The mountain looked resembling the one which has started reciting the scriptures clearly in the form of the deep sound of running streams of water, singing as it were at a high pitch, in the form of roaring sound of various cascades."
5-56-13,"The mountain stood as it were with uplifted arms in the form of very lofty deodars and which started crying loudly as it were, on all sides, in the form of the sound of its cascades."
5-56-14,"The mountain seemed to be trembling in the form of waving dark automnal groves, which was piping as it were, in the form of hollow bamboos shaken up by the wind and whistling."
5-56-15,"The mountain was hissing as it were with fury, in the form of its terrible and most poisonous snakes and which sat absorbed in meditation as it were, in the form of its deep caves covered with mist."
5-56-16,"The mountain seems to be setting out on a journey on all four sides, with feet of the mountain, looking like rising clouds, which with its peaks having a lining of clouds, seemed to stretch its limbs in the sky."
5-56-17,"The mountain was embellished with a number of summits and adorned with numerous caves scattered at many places and endowed with many sal, palmyrah, karna and bamboo trees."
5-56-18,"The mountain was adorned with clusters of creepers having plenty of flowers, filled with a number of summits and adorned with numerous caves scattered at many places and endowed with many sal, palmyrah, karna and bamboo trees."
5-56-19,"The mountain was endowed with many cascades, crowded together with heaps of rocks and frequented by great sages, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras and celestial serpents."
5-56-20,"The mountain was exquisite with creepers and trees, having caves inhabited by lions, spread over with a number of tigers and endowed with sweet roots and fruit-trees."
5-56-21,"Hanuma, the son of wind-god, in a hurry to see Rama, ascended that mountain, excited as he was with an extreme joy."
5-56-22,"Then, the rocks in the charming table-land of the mountain, on which the soles of Hanuma lied heavily, were crushed with noise and fallen to pieces."
5-56-23,"Desirous of reaching the northern shore from the southern shore of that ocean, Hanuma ascended that mountain and enlarged his body."
5-56-24,"Then, the valiant Hanuma after ascending the mountain, saw the terrific ocean inhabited by fishes and water-snakes."
5-56-25,"Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys and the son of the wind-god, entered the sky towards northern direction, like a wind, from southern direction."
5-56-26,"Pressed at that moment by Hanuma, that excellent mountain sank into the bowels of the earth along with the various living beings and made a noise with its shaking summits and toppling trees."
5-56-27,"Shaken by the impetus of the thighs of Hanuma, trees in blossom were broken and fell down on earth, as though struck by a thunder-bolt."
5-56-28,"When the lions of great prowess dwelling in the midst of caves were tormented and roared terribly, that roaring noise was heard as it was piercing the sky."
5-56-29,"The females of Vidyadhara class of supernatural beings, with their raiments in disorder through fear and their ornaments fallen off, went up all of a sudden from the mountain."
5-56-30,"Large poisonous serpents of immense size, possessing vigour and having fiery tongues with their hoods and necks severely pressed lay coiled."
5-56-31,"Then, leaving that tormented mountain of excellence; Kinnaras, Nagas, Gadharvas, Yakshas and Vidyadharas ascended to the sky."
5-56-32,"Pressed down by that strong Hanuma, that beautiful mountain having its elevated summits crowned with trees, entered the bowels of the earth."
5-56-33,"That mountain, with a width of ten yojanas (or eighty miles) and a height of thirty yojanas (or two hundred and forty miles) got level with the earth."
5-56-34,"With a desire to cross easily the terrific ocean, whose shores were being lashed by its waves, which Hanuma jumped up into the air."
5-57-1,"Hanuma, with a rush equal to that of wind, withaut a fatigue, leapt across the baundless sea looking analogaus to sky, like a large ship crossing the ocean. In that pleasant and auspiciaus sky-like sea, shone the moon as a white water-like sea, shone having the constellations known by the names of Pushya and Shravana as swans, the clauds as its duck-weeds; the twin constellations the Punarvasus as its large fish, the planet Mars as its large alligator, a large island as Airavata (Indra&#39;s elephant), graced with a swan in the form of the constellation, Shwati, having gales as its waves, the moon bea.ns as its cool water and with the Nagas, yakshas and Gandharvas as its full blown lotuses and water-lilies."
5-57-2,"While moving in the sky, the illustrious Hanuma, the son of wind-god and the great monkey, appeared as if swallowing the sky, scratching the moon and carrying off the sky with its stars and the disc of the sun and was going as though dragging asunder, a mass of clouds."
5-57-3,"Dense clauds, with white and red colaurs, blue and yellow colaurs as also green and reddish brown colaurs shone brightly in the sky."
5-57-4,"Time and again, entering and coming out of the clusters of clouds, Hanuma appeared like the moon becoming visible and invisible again and again."
5-57-5,"The heroic Hanuma, who was clad in white clothes, having faund his way into variaus kinds of dense clauds (and energing again) and having his personlaity becoming visible and invisible, shone like the moon in the sky."
5-57-6,"Tearing asunder the clusters of clouds again and again as also energing from them and roaring with a big noise, Hanuma the son of wind-god, making a thunderous great sound, shone flying like Garuda the eagle, in the sky."
5-57-7,"Killing the foremost of demons, becoming famaus by is name, making Lanka perplexed, causing anguish to Ravana by tormenting his terrible army, and bidding his adieu to Sheetha, Hanuma returned by flying over the middle of the sea."
5-57-8,"Touching Mount Mainaka, the victorious Hanuma came with a great speed resembling an iron arrow discharged from a bow-string."
5-57-9,"Approaching a bit near and observing Maunt Mahendra, the great mauntain looking like a dense claud, that Hanuma made a laud noise."
5-57-10,"Emitting a great roar, that Hanuma, whole loud noise resembled the rumbling of a cloud, filled the whole space in all directions with the noise."
5-57-11,"Having reached that place, Hanuma who was ardently desiraus of seeing his friends, roared and waved his tail."
5-57-12,"The sky, with the disc of the sun, began to crack as it were, due to his roar, even as he repeatedly roared on the path of the sky as followed by Garuda, the eagle endowed with charming wings."
5-57-13,"Those mighty heroes who were waiting already on the northern shore of the sea, with an eagerness to see Hanuma, heard there at that time, the saund produced by the sweeping motion of Hanuma&#39;s thighs, which resembled the reoar of a huge claud propelled by the wind."
5-57-14,"All those monkeys, who were distressed in mind (for not having heard the news of Seetha hitherto), heard Hanuma&#39;s roar similar to the roar of a rumbling cloud."
5-57-15,"Hearing that roar of Hanuma, who was making the saund, all those mokeys stationed there in all directions, became anxiausly desiraus of seeing their friend."
5-57-16,"The Jambavan, the foremot among the monkesy and bears, with his mind thrilled with joy, having summoned all the monkeys, spoke the follwoing words:"
5-57-17,"This Hanuma has accoMplished his assignment in all ways. His saund will not indeed be like this, if he has not fulfilled his task. There is not daubt in this matter."
5-57-18,"Hearing the sound of the dashing movement of the high souled Hanuma&#39;s arms and thighs, the monkeys moved by jumps with joy from their respective places."
5-57-19,"Those monkeys with joy, longing to see Hanuma, took off from the top of one tree to the tops of other trees as also from one mauntain-summit to the other summits."
5-57-20,"Those monkeys, grasping the boughs at the tops of trees, and standing there firmly, joyously waved the twigs, as if they are their raiments."
5-57-21,"The mighty, Hanuma the son of wind-god, roared as thaugh the wind roars while it enters the caves of mauntains."
5-57-22,"Seeing that Hanuma then rushing like a dense cloud, all those monkeys stood there, joining their palms in salutation."
5-57-23,"The swift Hanuma, looking like a mauntain, then descended on the summit of that Maunt mahendra, thick with trees."
5-57-24,"Hanuma like a mountain with its wings torn off, thrilled with joy, fell from the sky into a charming mountain-torrent."
5-57-25,"Then, all the foremost of those monkeys, with their pleasing hearts, stood surraunding the high-sauled Hanuma. Having encircled Hanuma, all of them obtained a supreme joy."
5-57-26,"All those mokeys with their delightful faces, taking roots and fruits as their presents, honured Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, who came back hale and healthy."
5-57-27,"Then, Hanuma the excellent one among the monkeys, on his part, offered his salutation to venerable persons and elders like Jambavan in the first place, as also Angada, the prince."
5-57-28,"Jambavan and Angada honoured that victorious and venerable Hanuma. The other monkeys also made him gracious. Hanuma informed them briefly that he had seen Seetha."
5-57-29,"Then, seizing the hand of Angada, Vali&#39;s son, Hanuma sat down at a distinct spot in the charming forest of Maunt Mahendra."
5-57-30,"Then, the pleased Hanuma spoke the following words to those excellent monkeys: I saw that Seetha, the duaghter of Janaka, who was staying in Ashoka garden, guarded unblemished by highly dreadful female-demons and wearing a single braid, young woman, as she was, longing to see Rama, thoroughly fatigued due to her fasting, with her hair twisted together, wearing soiled clothes and looking emaciated."
5-57-31,"Hearing from Hanuma that iMportant and nectar like word to the effect that Sheetha had been seen all the monkeys became delighted."
5-57-32,"Some mighty monkeys made a lion&#39;s roar. Some were making a sound of approbation. Some were making a sound of thunder. Some others proudced cries expressing joy. Some others were roaring in return."
5-57-33,"Shome eminent monkeys, with joy and with their tails lifted up, waved their distended curved tails."
5-57-34,"Descending from the mountain-tops; some other monkeys, with delight, fondingly touched Hanuma who resembled an elephant."
5-57-35,"After hearing the words of Hanuma, Angada spoke the follwoing excellent words in the midst of those eminent monkeys."
5-57-36,"O Hanuma! Since you returned here crossing the extensive ocean, none stands equal to you in strength and prowess."
5-57-37,"What amazing is yaur devotion to the Lord! What a wonderful prowess! What a surprising caurage! By aur good fortune, yau saw the illustriaus Sheetha, Rama&#39;s consort. Thank heaven! Rama can give up his sorrow born aut of Sheetha&#39;s separataion."
5-57-38,"Very much delighted, the monkeys then sat on extensive flat rocks encircling Angada, Hanuma and Jambavan."
5-57-39,"Longing to hear abaut crossing of ocean and the seeing of Lanka, Sheetha and Ravana, all those excellent monkeys waited with their joined pal.ns, in anctipation of Hanuma&#39;s words."
5-57-40,"The auspicious Angada encircled by many monkeys there, waited like Indra the lord of celestials, who was waited upon by celestials in heaven."
5-57-41,"The high and large summit of the mauntain, on which were seated then with delight, the illustriaus Hanuma and the famaus Angada, with bracelets worn on his upper ar.ns, stood blazed with splendaur."
5-58-1,"Thereafter, the mighty monkeys, headed by Hanuma and others, experienced a great joy on that summit of Mount Mahendra."
5-58-2,"Then, Jambavan, thrilling with rapture, asked the delighted Hanuma, the great monkey about the particulars of that actual occurrence (of seeing Seetha) as follows"
5-58-3,"How did you see Seetha? How was she there? How was that Ravana of terrible deeds behaving towards her?"
5-58-4,"O Hanuma! Tell us entirely, in truth whatever has occurred. Ascertaining the truth, from you, we shall again think about what decision to be taken further."
5-58-5,"When we go there (to the presence of Rama), having prudence, tell us clearly which matter is to be disclosed and which matter is to be kept off from him."
5-58-6,"Thus commanded by Jambavan, Hanuma, with his hair standing on end mentally offered his salutation to Seetha, the princess, by bowing his head and replied as follows:"
5-58-7,"With an intention to reach the southern shore of the ocean, I leapt into the sky, indeed before your presence, from the summit of Mount Mahendra."
5-58-8,"While I was going, a terrific hindrance occurred in my way as it was. I saw a golden mountain-peak which was so charming and fascinating."
5-58-9,"I accounted that mountain staying turned towards the path, as an impediment. Approaching that excellent charming and golden mountain, I made up my mind to shatter it."
5-58-10,"As I struck it with my tail, the mountain-peak of that great hill, resembling the sun, was broken into a thousand pieces."
5-58-11,"Understanding my purpose, that great mountain spoke the following sweet words saying, &#39;O my son!&#39;, As though it was refreshing my mind (once more to proceed further)."
5-58-12," &#39;Know me to be generally called as Mynaa dwelling in this great ocean, as a companion of the wind-god and even as your father&#39;s brother&#39;."
5-58-13," &#39;O my son! Long ago, the foremost among the mountains used to have wings. They used to wander the entire earth freely, hurting the people!"
5-58-14," &#39;Hearing that behaviour of those mountains, the venerable Indra the lord of celestials, the destroyer of a demon called Paka, chopped their wings into a thousand pieces by using his thunderbolt.&#39; "
5-58-15," &#39;O child! I, on my part, was hurled into the great ocean by the high-souled wind-god, your father and was liberated from the clutches of Indra.&#39; "
5-58-16," &#39;O Hanuma the annihilator of enemies! I have to behave in such a way as to help Rama. For, Rama, having a prowess equal to that of Indra; is indeed excellent in supporting righteousness.&#39;"
5-58-17,"Hearing the words of that high-souled Mynaka and after informing my purpose, my mind was prepared for a further travel. The high-soled Mynaka also allowed me to depart."
5-58-18,"That Mynaka mountain vanished in the guise of a beautiful form of a human being. That large mountainous form also later drowned into the great ocean."
5-58-19,"Thereafter, employing an excellent speed and continuing on my course, I proceeded in that path speedily for a long time."
5-58-20,"Thereafter, I saw Surasa, the mother of serpents in the midst of the sea. That goddess spoke the following words to me."
5-58-21,"O excellent of monkeys! The celestials have shown you as my eatable. Therefore, I will eat you since you have been bestowed to me by gods after a long time."
5-58-22,"Hearing Surasa&#39;s words, I stood there, offering salutation with my joined palms to her. Becoming pale-faced, I spoke the following words:"
5-58-23," &#39;Rama, the son of Dasaratha the splendid man and the tormentator of enemies, together with Lakshmana, his brother and Seetha entered the forest of Dandaka.&#39;"
5-58-24," &#39;The evil-minded Ravana took away Seetha, Rama&#39;s wife. By the orders of Rama, I am going to her as an envoy.&#39; "
5-58-25,"&#39;You, abiding in Rama&#39;s country, ought to do a help to Rama. Otherwise, after seeing Seetha and Rama, who is unwearied in action, I will come to your mouth. I am thus promising you in truth."
5-58-26,"Hearing my words, that Surasa who can assume any form at her will said: No one can violate me by unfaithfulness. I have this boon with me."
5-58-27,"Hearing the words of Surasa, I, as tall as ten Yojanas (eighty miles), within a moment, grew half as much in size (fifteen Yojanas or one hundred twenty miles)."
5-58-28,"She opened her mouth so wide as to correspond to the size of my body. Seeing her expanded mouth, I assumed a dwarfish form. At that moment, I still became reduced to the size of a human thumb."
5-58-29,"After entering her mouth quickly, I then came out instantly. The divine Surasa, in her native form, spoke to me again, as follows:"
5-58-30,"&#39;O gently monkey! O the foremost among monkeys! Go happily for the fulfillment of your purpose. Bring back Seetha to the magnanimous Rama. O mighty armed monkey! Be happy. I am pleased with you.&#39;"
5-58-31,"Then, all living beings praised me! Saying Good! Well done! Bravo! Thereupon, I leapt into the extensive sky, like Garuda the eagle, the carrier of Lord Vishnu."
5-58-32,"In the meanwhile, my shadow was held fast. Yet, I did not perceive anything. My speed having been blocked, I surveyed all the ten directions. But I could not discover there, any object by which my movement was blocked."
5-58-33,"Then, the thought arose in me: How I wonder has such a hindrance arose in my journey, although no concrete configuration is being seen here?"
5-58-34,"While I was thinking thus, my sight has fallen downward. There, I saw a terrible female-demon lying in water."
5-58-35,"Heartily laughing with a great noise, that terrific woman, spoke to me the following inauspicious words, firmly and without any bewilderment (as follows):"
5-58-36,"O gigantic monkey! Where are you going? You are my requisite food, hungry as I am. Gratify my person, who has remained without sustenance for long."
5-58-37,"Saying &#39;Amen&#39;, I actually accepted those words. Thereupon, I expanded my body to a size larger than the capacity of her mouth."
5-58-38,"Her terrific large mouth too began to grow to devour me. She could not understand well about me or about the change subsequently gone through by me (in the shape of a minute form)"
5-58-39,"Then, having contracted my large body within another moment, I extracted her heart and leapt back into the sky."
5-58-40,"When her heart has been cut off by me, that terrific Simhika looking like a mountain, fell into the ocean with her arms emanating from it."
5-58-41,"I heard great sages along with wandering celestial singers, moving in the sky, saying that Simhika the dreadful demon was instantly killed by Hanuma."
5-58-42,"After killing her and again recollecting the task to be performed quickly, I travelled for a long distance and saw the southern shore of the ocean, where that City of Lanka, adorned with its trees, was situated."
5-58-43,"While the sun was setting, I, without being noticed by the demons of dreadful prowess, entered the city of Lanka, the abode of demons."
5-58-44,"While I was entering the City, a woman, resembling a cloud at the time of dissolution of the world, stood up in front of me, emitting a loud laughter."
5-58-45,"Then defeating that woman, having her hair looking terrific like a blazing fire and who was trying to kill me, by striking her with a blow of the fist of my left hand and entered the land of Lanka at the dusk of early night. she, being frightened, spoke to me as follows:"
5-58-46,"O hero! I am (the personified) City of Lanka. Therefore, by the same prowess you conquered me, you can defeat all the demons here completely."
5-58-47,"Searching there for Seetha that whole night in Ravana&#39;s gynaecium, I could not find that Seetha, the slender-waisted lady."
5-58-48,"Unable to find Seetha in Ravana&#39;s dwelling and facing a sea of sorrow, I could not then perceive its other shore."
5-58-49,"While bemoaning, I saw an excellent grove near that gynaecium, concealed by a prolonged fence painted with golden colour."
5-58-50,"Crossing the fence, I saw that grove having copious trees. Amidst that Ashoka garden, I saw a large Shimshupa* garden. After ascending it, I beheld an yellow-pigmented thicket of banana plants."
5-58-51,"Not far from that Shimshupa tree. I saw Seetha, of youthful complexion, with eyes looking like lotus-petals, with her face emaciated by fasting, clad in a single piece of cloth, her hair soiled with dust, her limbs afflicted with grief and agony, devoted as she was to the good of her lord and surrounded on all sides by ugly and cruel female-demons living on flesh and blood, as a doe encircled by tigresses."
5-58-52,"Seetha, who had eyes like those of a deer, was somehow quickly found by me looking depressed in the amidst of female-demons, frightened (as she was by them) again and again, putting on a single braid of hair (as a mark of desolation), wholly devoted to the thought of her lord, having floor as her bedstead, pale-limbed like a lotus-stalk in a cool season, turning away the request of Ravana, and determined to die."
5-58-53,"Seeing that illustrious woman, the consort of Rama in such a state, I stayed perched on the same Simsupa tree, looking at her."
5-58-54,"Meanwhile, I heard an exceedingly roaring and hallooing sound, mixed with sounds of girdles and anklets in the abode of Ravana."
5-58-55,"Then, I was very much frightened and contracted my physique. I, on my part, remained hidden like a bird in that Simsupa tree dense with foliage.&#39;"
5-58-56,"Then, the mighty Ravana and his wives reached that place where Seetha was staying."
5-58-57,"Thereupon, seeing that Ravana the chief of a troop of demons, Seetha with her lovely waist, sat compressing her thighs enclosing her swollen breasts with her arms."
5-58-58,"Ravana, bowing his head and coming down, spoke (as follows) to that Seetha who was frightened, very much grieving for her lord, glancing hither and thither, not finding any protection for her, trembling, distressed and extremely sorrowful saying, &#39;Treat me with respect.&#39;"
5-58-59," &#39;O arrogant lady! O Seetha! If you refuse me by your arrogance, I will be drinking your blood after a period of two months.&#39;"
5-58-60,"Hearing those words of the evil-minded Ravana, Seetha was very much irritated and spoke the following excellent words:"
5-58-61,"How did your tongue not fall of, O the worst demon, by speaking such words not to be uttered, to the consort of Rama, of boundless glory, and the daughter-in-law of Dasaratha the lord of Ikshvaku dynasty?"
5-58-62,"O ignoble soul! Of what account is your prowess, when you came unnoticed during the absence of my lord, that great soul and abducted me, O sinful one?"
5-58-63," &#39;You have no similarity with Rama. You are unfit even to do service to Rama. Rama performs sacrifices. He speaks only truth. He is a lover of battle&#39;."
5-58-64,"Hearing these harsh words from Seetha, Ravana was at once ablaze with anger, as a fire blazes in a pile of wood."
5-58-65," &#39;Rolling his cruel eyes and lifting his right fist, Ravana was about to kill Seetha. Then, an alarm was raised by a women there&#39;."
5-58-66,"Springing up from the midst of those women, a royal woman named Mandodari, the wife of that evil-minded Ravana, ran to him. He was restrained by her."
5-58-67,"She spoke to Ravana, smitten with love, the following sweet words: &#39;O Ravana having a prowess similar to that of Indra! Of what need is with Seetha to you?"
5-58-68," &#39;O lord! Enjoy yourself with the daughters of gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians and Yakshas the semi-divine beings. What will you do with Seetha?&#39;"
5-58-69,"Thereupon, those women together propitiated that mighty Ravana and quickly took him to his palace."
5-58-70,"When that Ravana left, the ugly-faced female-demons frightened. Seetha with their cruel and very dreadful words."
5-58-71,"Seetha reckoned the utterance of those women as a blade of grass. At that time, the roaring of those female-demons reached Seetha in vain."
5-58-72,"As their roaring frittered away, those flesh-eating female-demons became helpless and reported that great resolve of Seetha to Ravana."
5-58-73,"Thereafter, all those women joined together, warded off their hopes and held back their effort. In the end, they encircled Seetha and were overpowered with sleep."
5-58-74,"When those women went to sleep, Seetha, intent upon the welfare of her husband, was deeply aggrieved, miserable and sore depressed as she was, lamenting pitifully."
5-58-75,"Trijata, rising from the midst of those female-demons, spoke the following words; &#39;Feed on yourself quickly rather than on Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, a virtuous woman and the daughter-in-law of Dasartha who des not get destroyed&#39;."
5-58-76,"&#39;Now, I have seen a dreadful dream, causing my hair to stand erect. It is pointing towards the ruin of our demons and the victory of her husband."
5-58-77," �We will pray Seetha, who is capable of protecting all our female-demons from Rama. I feel that it is batter for us&#39;."
5-58-78," &#39;When such a dream is seen while a woman is weeping, that woman gets relieved of many kinds of sorrows and will obtain happiness. Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, indeed will be pleased on receiving a salutation&#39;."
5-58-79,"Delighted at hearing the victory of her lord, that girl Seetha then basfully spoke: &#39;If it is true, I will be protecting you all&#39;."
5-58-80,"Taking rest for some time and seeing such a dreadful state of Seetha, I reflected upon it. My mind could not satisfy itself."
5-58-81,"Thinking about a means for starting a conversation with Seetha, I started to describe the history of Ikshvaku&#39;s dynasty."
5-58-82,"Hearing the words spoken by me, which are adored by the assemblies of royal sages, Seetha the princess, with her eyes filled with tears, spoke to me, as follows:"
5-58-83," &#39;O the foremost among the monkeys! Who are you? Why did you come here? How did you come? What type of friendship do you have with Rama? You ought to tell me all this?"
5-58-84,"Hearing those words of Seetha, I spoke the following words: &#39;O princess! There is a courageous king of monkeys, by name Sugreeva, who is a mighty companion to your husband, possessing a terrific prowess."
5-58-85,"Know me, who came here, as Hanuma, a servant of that Sugreeva, Rama, you husband, who is unwearied in his actions, sent me here for your sake."
5-58-86,"O illustrious lady! Rama, the foremost among men and the glorious man, gave this finger-ring personally to you as a token of remembrance."
5-58-87,"O princess! For that reason, I wish to have a command from you. What am I to do? I shall take you to the proximity of Rama and Lakshmana. What do you say?"
5-58-88,"Hearing my words and understanding them, Seetha the daughter of Janaka said as follows: &#39;Let Rama take me back, after killing Ravana&#39;."
5-58-89,"Bowing my head in salutation to the noble and irreproachable Seetha, I asked for a token of remembrance which would gladden the heart of Rama."
5-58-90,"Then, Seetha spoke to me as follows: &#39;Let this foremost jewel, be taken, by which the long-armed Rama will be having a high opinion of you&#39;."
5-58-91,"Speaking thus, Seetha having fine hips, gave that wonderful and the foremost jewel. Highly distressed, she gave a message also in words to me."
5-58-92,"Then, offering salutation to Seetha the princess in utmost devotion, I circumambulated her from left to right, of course with my mind setting out to come here."
5-58-93,"Determining something in mind, she spoke to me again as follows: &#39;O Hanuma! You ought to tell Rama about my tale of woes occurring here&#39;."
5-58-94," &#39;Act so that both those heroes Rama and Lakshmana together with Sugreeva quickly arrive here, soon after hearing my tale&#39;."
5-58-95,"&#39;If proves to be otherwise, my survival will be only for two months. Rama cannot see me thereafter. As such, I will be dying like a helpless woman&#39;."
5-58-96,"Hearing those miserable words, I became angry. Thereafter, I thought of my remaining successive action to be done."
5-58-97,"Thereafter, my body grew up to a size equal to that of a mountain. Then, I started destroying that garden, thereby longing for a combat."
5-58-98,"The female-demons; with their ugly faces woke up and saw that thicket of garden being broken and with its frightened animals and birds moving about unsteadily."
5-58-99,"Coming from their respective places and seeing me in that garden, those female-demons quickly went and reported the matter to Ravana (as follows):"
5-58-100,"O mighty king! Indeed not knowing your prowess, an evil-minded monkey ahs demolished your inaccessible garden."
5-58-101,"O emperor! Give orders quickly for killing him, so that the evil-minded monkey, who caused offence to you, will get destroyed."
5-58-102,"Hearing those words, Ravana sent invincible demons called Kinkaras, who were adapted to the mind of Ravana."
5-58-103,"In that portion of the garden, I destroyed with an iron rod, eight thousand kinkaras, having darts and hammers in their hands."
5-58-104,"Taking quick steps, those few who have survived, went and reported the news to Ravana, of their large army having been killed by me."
5-58-105,"Then, an idea came to me. Occupying a lofty palatial mansion of a sanctuary which was an eminent ornament of Lanka. I killed again a hundred demons stationed there with a pillar."
5-58-106,"Then, Ravana dispatched Jambumali, the son of Prahasta together with numerous dreadful demons having terrific forms."
5-58-107,"I destroyed that demon, though endowed with a great strength and skilled in warfare, along with his followers, with my terrific iron bar itself."
5-58-108,"Hearing of it, Ravana, the king of demons, dispatched the son of his minister, endowed with great strength and strengthened with a regiment of infantry."
5-58-109,"I killed all of them also by that iron bar itself. Hearing of the minster&#39;s sons, who were quick in exhibiting their valour in battle, having been killed, Ravana dispatched five valiant generals."
5-58-110,"I got all the minster&#39;s sons together with their army destroyed. Then, Ravana, the ten-headed monster, sent his mighty son, Aksha together with a multitude of army for the combat."
5-58-111,"I suddenly caught by the feet, that prince, son of Mandodari, who was skilled in warfare and who was jumping into the sky with his sword and shield. I whirled him round a hundred times and crushed him."
5-58-112,"Hearing of the death of Aksha in combat, that ten-headed Ravana was very much enraged and thereupon dispatched his second son, by name Indrajit, who was strong but foolishly arrogant in battle."
5-58-113,"By conquering all that army in battle and making that Indrajit the foremost among demons; lusterless, I experienced a great joy."
5-58-114,"Ravana himself dispatched, with a great confidence, that long-armed and mighty Indrajit along with valiant demons excited with their arrogance."
5-58-115,"Knowing me to be irresistible and his own army being perishable, that Indrajit with a great haste, captured me with a Brahma-missile."
5-58-116,"Then, the demons, after capturing me, tied me there with ropes and carried me away to Ravana&#39;s presence."
5-58-117,"Seeing me, the evil-minded Ravana spoke to me. He asked, why did you come to Lanka? &#39;Why did you kill the demons?&#39;"
5-58-118,"I answered &#39;I have done all these acts for the sake of Seetha. O king of demons! I came to your abode with a desire to see Seetha. I am the offspring of wind-god and a monkey by name Hanuma&#39;."
5-58-119," &#39;Know me to be a monkey, an envoy of Rama and a minister of Sugreeva. As Rama&#39;s messenger, I sought your presence here!"
5-58-120," �That Sugreeva of great splendour enquired about your welfare. He told you (the following) beneficiary words, endowed with righteousness wealth and pleasure, appropriate for you&#39;."
5-58-121," &#39;While I was dwelling in Mount R^ishyamuka, abounding with numerous trees, Rama having a great prowess in battle became a friend to me&#39;."
5-58-122," &#39;The king Rama told me that his wife had been taken away by a demon and that I had to help him in that matter by all means&#39;."
5-58-123," &#39;I also told him about the killing of Vali and requested him to come to a mutual agreement for helping me in that matters&#39;."
5-58-124," &#39;Rama, the great lord along with Lakshmana made friendship with Sugreeva, (whose kingdom was taken away by Vali) taking Agni the fire-god for a witness.&#39;"
5-58-125," &#39;Killing Vali by a single arrow in combat, Rama made Sugreeva (lord of monkeys) an emperor of monkeys&#39;."
5-58-126," &#39;Now we have to extend help to that Rama in all ways. Therefore, I am sending Hanuma rightly to your presence&#39;."
5-58-127," &#39;Even before the heroic monkeys destroy your army, bring Seetha quickly and give her back to Rama&#39;."
5-58-128," &#39;To whom is this strength of the monkeys not already known, who go even to the presence of gods, when invited by them for help?&#39;"
5-58-129," &#39;Sugreeva the king of monkeys has sent the foregoing message to you. &#39;When spoken by me in these words, Ravana was enraged and looked on me, as though he was going to reduce me to ashes with his very looks."
5-58-130,"Without knowing my glory ( in the form of my immunity to death), the evil-minded Ravana, the demon doing terrific acts, ordered for my killing."
5-58-131,"Then, there is the brother of that Ravana, called Vibhishana having a great intelligence. He entreated Ravana, the king of demons, on my behalf (as follows)"
5-58-132,"O Ravana the foremost among the demons! No such attempt should be made in this way. Let this design be abandoned forthwith. Your are indeed following a path which is contrary to the statesmanship."
5-58-133,"O Ravana! It is not indeed found in states&#39; policies of killing an envoy. The real truth is to be known from an envoy speaking a good counsel."
5-58-134,"O Ravana of great prowess! Even if a very high offence is committed by an envoy, an act of disfiguring the person is mentioned in a treatise of state-policy and not of killing."
5-58-135,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Ravana ordered those demons to burn my tail by fire."
5-58-136,"Thereupon, hearing Ravana&#39;s words; the demons wrapped up my entire tail with bark of hemp and torn cotton-clothes."
5-58-137,"Thereafter, the demons of terrible prowess, who completed their arrangements, striking me with their wooden staffs and fists, burnt my tail. Eventhough I was bound with many ropes, I maintained restraint."
5-58-138,"Then, having reached the city-gate, those strong demons made a loud proclamation of my presence in the principal streets, bound and enveloped in flames as I was."
5-58-139,"Then, after contracting my gigantic form once more and releasing my bondage, I stood in my native form again. Seizing an iron bar, I killed those demons."
5-58-140,"Then, I quickly jumped on to that city-gate and without any bewilderment, I set fire that city with its attics, ramparts and gates with my tail inflamed, even as a fire at the end of the world, burns all living creatures."
5-58-141,"The entire Lanka has been reduced to ashes. No place is seen unburnt in this City. Therefore Seetha also must have been surely burnt."
5-58-142,"Thus filled with grief, I came about to reflect as above. Meanwhile, I heard the auspiciously worded utterance of charanas the celestial signers who were narrating a tale of astonishment saying that Seetha has not been burnt."
5-58-143,"After hearing those surprising words, a thought arose in me that Seetha escaped being burnt. This indicated by the following good omens:"
5-58-144,"In the first place, even though me tail is burning, the fire is not burning my body. My heart too is delighted. The winds are sweet-smelling."
5-58-145,"My heart was delighted by seeing those good omens having their fruits apparent, by looking into the their fruits apparent, by looking into the reasons of high characteristics and by hearing the words of accomplished sages."
5-58-146,"Seeing Seetha once more, relieved by her again and then reaching the Mount Arishta there again, I started leaping back (over the sea) with a longing to see you (all)."
5-58-147,"Then, treading upon the path of the sky, frequented by the wind, the moon, the sun, Siddhas the semi-divine beings and Gandharvas the celestial musicians, I saw you all here."
5-58-148,"I performed all tasks for accomplishing the purpose of Sugreeva, by the grace of Rama and also through your energy."
5-58-149,"I have done all this properly there. Do accomplish that which remains undone in this task by me and complete it."
5-59-1,"After informing all this, Hanuma the son of wind-god started telling more of the following words."
5-59-2,"By the power of virtuousness of Seetha, Rama&#39;s effort and Sugreeva&#39;s zeal are getting fulfilled. My mind too is devoted to her."
5-59-3,"Ravana, the king of demons, who is strong in all ways, can burn away the three worlds by the power of his penance. Even if he is enraged, he can scorch away his adversaries."
5-59-4,"His body, which touched Seetha the daughter of Janaka, was not destroyed because of his askesis. Even a flame, when fully touched with one&#39;s hand, cannot do that which Seetha would, if stirred by anger."
5-59-5,"This work (of mine in the form of Seetha&#39;s discovery) has been informed to you in this way. It is indeed proper to see those two princes (Rama and Lakshmana) along with Seetha, after taking permission from all the great monkeys headed by Jambavan."
5-59-6,"I am sufficient, even alone; to destroy rapidly that City of Lanka together with those troops of demons as also the mighty Ravana."
5-59-7,"When accompanied by you, who are strong, whose spirit is disciplined, who are proficient in the use of arms, valiant, longing for victory and moving by jumps, how much more is required?"
5-59-8,"In the battle, I on my part will kill Ravana along with his army, his forerunners, his sons and his brothers."
5-59-9,"In the battle, I can blow out the missiles presided over by Indra the lord of celestials, Brahma the creator, Rudra the god of destruction, Vayu the wind-god, Varuna the god of water and even those missiles even if they are difficult to be looked at, employed by Indrajit (Ravana&#39;s eldest son)."
5-59-10,"My prowess, when permitted by you, will frustrate that Ravana. The shower of rocks, which will be unequalled and incessant, discharged by me, can kill even celestials. How much more those demons?"
5-59-11,"The ocean may overflow its shore. Mount Mandara may move from its position. But, in battle, no army of adversaries can stagger Jambavan."
5-59-12,"The heroic Angada, the son of Vali alone, is sufficient to destroy all the troops of demons and even the demons who were their progenitors."
5-59-13,"By the rapid movement of the thighs of the high-souled Neela and of Panasa, even Mount Mandara can be shattered. How much more, the demons in battle?"
5-59-14,"Tell me any one who can fight against Mainda or Dvivida, among Gandharvas the celestial singers or Uragas the serpents or Pakshis the birds or the celestials or the demons or Yakshas the semi-divine beings."
5-59-15,"These two illustrious sons of Ashvini Kumaras, Mainda and Dvivida are the foremost among the monkeys. In the battle-field, I do not find anyone who can fight against these two monkeys."
5-59-16,"Proud of having received boons from Brahma the creator and their grandfather and abiding in a supreme haughtiness, these two foremost among all the monkeys live on Amrita the nectar."
5-59-17,"Long ago, Brahma the grandfather of all the worlds gave an unequal boon to them in honour of Ashvini Kumaras regarding their inviolability."
5-59-18,"By the pride of those boons, those two heroic monkeys harassed a great army of celestials and thereupon drank up nectar, excited as they were with joy."
5-59-19,"Let all the other monkeys stand aside. Even these Mainda and Dvivida on their part are capable of destroying the entire city of Lanka together with its horses, chariots and elephants."
5-59-20,"I alone burnt and destroyed the City of Lanka. In all its royal high-ways, the name (of Rama and others) was proclaimed by me as follows:"
5-59-21,"&#39;Victorious is Rama, the exceedingly strong and the mighty Lakshmana too! Victorious is King Sugreeva, protected by Rama. I am Hanuma, a servant of Rama and the son of wind-god&#39;. In this way, the name (of Rama and others) was heralded by me everywhere."
5-59-22,"In the midst of Ashoka garden of the evil-minded Ravana and underneath a Shimshupa tree, the virtuous Seetha was seen staying dejected, encircled as she was with female-demons, agonized with grief and anguish, lusterless like a digit of the moon encircled by a line of clouds and disregarding that Ravana who is arrogant of his strength."
5-59-23,"Seetha, a devoted and virtuous wife, having charming hips, has been placed under restraint. The auspicious Seetha is devoted to Rama in all ways, giving her undivided thought to Rama like Shachi the goddess, giving her concern to Indra the destroyer of strong holds."
5-59-24,"Weaving that single piece of cloth, which she had on her person even while being borne away by Ravana, and likewise covered with dust, she was seen by me in a miserable condition with her grief and anguish, devoted as she was to the welfare of her husband."
5-59-25,"I saw Seetha in a royal pleasure garden, amidst some female-demons. Seetha was being frightened time and again by those ugly female-demons. That Seetha, wearing a single braid of hair and looking depressed, was fully engaged in thinking about her lord. Looking like a lotus with a discoloured figure in winter, she had determined to die, utterly averting to do anything with Ravana."
5-59-26,"With great difficulty, I created confidence in that fawn-eyed Seetha. Thereafter, I talked to her and explained everything to her. She was delighted to hear the companionship cropped up between Rama and Sugreeva."
5-59-27,"That high-souled Seetha does not kill Ravana who has committed an offence because she conducts herself well with restraint and since supreme is her devotion to her lord."
5-59-28,"Rama, on his part, will become mere instrument in killing that Ravana. That Seetha, who is by her own nature, on delicate-limbed woman, was emaciated because of separation from her lord. She had grown thin like the learning of a scholar continuing his studies even on the first day of lunar fortnight (which must be observed as a complete holiday by students."
5-59-29,"Thus, the illustrious Seetha remains immersed in grief. Let all that be done, which requires to be counteracted by way of a relief in this matter."
5-60-1,"Hearing those words of Hanuma, Angada the son of Vali spoke as follows: Even after our seeing of Seetha, it is not proper for us to approach the high-souled Rama without taking Seetha with us."
5-60-2,"I perceive it as improper to inform there that Seetha the princess, though seen by you of renowned prowess, has not been brought here."
5-60-3,"O the best of monkeys! No one is equal to us even in our prowess nor indeed anyone who can leap like us in the worlds either of celestials or demons."
5-60-4,"Hanuma indeed thus killed all the warriors among the demons. What work is remaining to be done by us? We will go, after taking Janaki."
5-60-5,"Jambavan, the foremost among the forest-animals, understanding the sense, was very much pleased and spoke the following meaningful words to that Angada, who thus formed a resolution."
5-60-6,"O prince! This thought you thus perceive is not incompetent of us. But, you must see the way in which Rama&#39;s inclination would be, for the accomplishment of the object."
5-61-1,"Thereupon, the heroic monkeys like Angada and others as also Hanuma, the great one among the monkeys accepted the words of Jambavan."
5-61-2,"Then, the excellent monkeys, resembling Meru and Mandara mountains, like elephants in rut, as if covering the sky, having huge bodies and colossal strength, keeping Hanuma in their front, leaving Mount Mahendra, went ahead leaping delightfully. They looked as though conducted by the mind&#39;s eyes of Hanuma, who is adored by living beings as having good stupendous swiftness, they having resolved to fulfill the purpose of Rama and to attain a great glory, having accomplished the purpose and duly determined to complete the task. All of them were looking up at narrating the previous pleasant tidings and taking delight in war. All of them, in high spirits, were judging rightly the vengeance of Rama against the evil-minded Ravana."
5-61-3,"Then, those monkeys, leaping into the sky and floating in the air, reached a garden looking like Nandanavana the divine grove filled with trees and creepers."
5-61-4,"They reached, that Madhuvana by name, the garden abounded with honey, which was protected grove, unapproachable for all and looking fascinated to the soul of all beings."
5-61-5,"A very powerful monkey called Dadhimukha, who was a high-souled eminent monkey and the maternal uncle of Sugreeva always protected that garden."
5-61-6,"Reaching that huge grove, which was very dear to the heart of Sugreeva, those monkeys became highly excessive in their behaviour."
5-61-7,"Then, seeing that large Madhuvana, the garden abounded in honey, those monkeys, whose colour was as yellow as honey, were delighted and solicited Angada the prince for permission to taste the honey."
5-61-8,"Thereupon, Angada the prince, taking approval from those elders like Jambavan and others, gave the monkeys a liberty to drink honey there."
5-61-9,"Thereafter, all those monkeys, thus permitted to drink honey, were exceedingly pleased. Then, those excited monkeys felt glad and began dancing."
5-61-10,"Some were singing. Some were offering salutations. Some were dancing. Some were laughing loudly. Some were falling down. Some were moving in different directions. Some were jumping up. Some were talking incoherently."
5-61-11,"Some were leaning against one another. Some were falling upon one another. Some were disputing with one another. Some were playing with one another."
5-61-12,"Some were running from one tree to another. Some were falling down to the ground from the tree-tops. Some, with a missile-like speed, were flying towards the tops of gigantic trees from the ground."
5-61-13,"While one was singing, another approached him laughing. While one was laughing, another approached him weeping. While one was weeping, another approached him pushing. While one was pushing, another approached him roaring."
5-61-14,"That army of monkeys, moving in excessively honey-drunken state, became highly excited. None in that army was not drunk. None in that army was not satiated."
5-61-15,"Seeing that grove, being consumed and the trees stripped off their leaves and flowers the monkey named Dadhimukha (who was incharge of the grove) then angrily interrupted those monkeys."
5-61-16,"Threatened by those monkeys who were behaving excessively, Dadhimukha who was endowed with a terrible energy, the care-taker of the grove and an elderly hero of the monkeys further contemplated the means to protect that grove from the monkeys."
5-61-17,"He spoke harsh words with some and courageously struck some others with his palms uninterruptedly, created a quarrel by coming into collusion with some, and approached some in a conciliatory manner."
5-61-18,"That Dadhimukha was dragged, after coming into collusion with him by those monkeys, who were being forcibly hindered by him, eventhough those monkeys overpowered him with unrestrained emotion arising out of their intoxication, those who had abandoned their fear disregarding any bad consequence of their act."
5-61-19,"Bruising with their nails, biting with their teeth on account of their inebriety and making short work of that Dadhimukha with their palms and feet, all those moneys made that large grove, divested of its flowers, fruits and honey."
5-62-1,"Hanuma, like a bull among the monkeys and the foremost among them spoke to them as follows: Cherish the honey with a cool mind, O monkeys! I will keep off your opposer who is standing in your way."
5-62-2,"Hearing the words of Hanuma, the gracious minded Angada the principal among the monkeys repeated the words: Let the monkeys drink the honey."
5-62-3,"The words, though improper of Hanuma who had accomplished his task, are to be obliged certainly by me. Wherefore then, moreover, on such an occasion?"
5-62-4,"Hearing the words coming from the mouth of Angada, those monkeys who were like bulls among the monkeys were delighted and answered with reverence, saying &#39;good, good!&#39;"
5-62-5,"Reverencing Angada the foremost among the monkeys, all the monkeys rushed towards Madhuvana, the grove abounding in honey, like the rush of a river towards a tree."
5-62-6,"Because Hanuma had seen Seetha and others had heard of her and because of the grant of permission from Angada, all those gifted monkeys entered Madhuvana the grove, overpowered the guards with their prowess, drank honey and the partook juicy fruits there."
5-62-7,"Then, all those monkeys jumped on the guards of the grove, who came there in hundreds together and banged them."
5-62-8,"All those monkeys together took vessels of honey in their arms and drank them. Some others banged those who obstructed them."
5-62-9,"Some monkeys, with their skin-colour as yellow as honey, after drinking vessels of honey, also threw some honey away. Some others, with the remnant of honey in their arms, after drinking, whipped up one another with their excessive intoxication."
5-62-10,"Some others, seizing a branch of a tree, stood rooted at the foot of a tree. Some, who were highly intoxicated, laid down spreading leaves on the ground."
5-62-11,"Those monkeys, who were intoxicated by drinking the honey, became inebriated and started pushing one another cheerfully and some others began to stumble."
5-62-12,"Some were roaring like lions. Some, with joy, whistled like birds. Some monkeys, inebriated as they were by drinking honey, simply slept on the floor."
5-62-13,"Doing something or other, some were laughing. Some others were doing something else. Some were telling what they were doing, while some others were understanding some things else."
5-62-14,"The honey-keepers, who were there as messengers of Dadhimukha in that Madhuvana, were warded off by the terrific monkeys and they fled to different directions."
5-62-15,"Dragged by their knees and tossed up in the air by the monkeys, those honey-keepers were very much depressed, went to Dadhimukha and complained as follows:"
5-62-16,"The monkeys, as permitted by Hanuma, violently destroyed Madhuvana. We were dragged by our knees and further tossed up in the air."
5-62-17,"Hearing that Madhuvana was damaged, Dadhimukha, the grove-protector there was enraged and thereafter consoled those monkeys (as follows):"
5-62-18,"Come here let us go there and prevent by our force, the monkeys who are arrogant of their strength and are consuming the honey."
5-62-19,"Hearing these words of Dadhimukha, the foremost of those monkeys who displayed their heroism, quickly went again to madhuvana along with him."
5-62-20,"Grasping a tree, Dadhimukha speedily took up his position in the middle of those monkeys in Madhuvana. All his follower-monkeys also ran with him."
5-62-21,"Those enraged monkeys, taking rocks, trees and even mountains, went to the place wehre those foremost of monkeys were there."
5-62-22,"Those heroic monkeys, keeping the words of their master in mind, briskly ran with Sala trees, palm trees and rocks as their weapons."
5-62-23,"Then, the valiant guards of the grove running in thousands invaded the monkeys who were on trees, at the foot of the trees and who were arrogant of their strength."
5-62-24,"Seeing Dadhimukha coming with anger, Hanuma along with eminent monkeys ran towards him with speed."
5-62-25,"The enraged Angada struck there with his arms, that long-armed Dadhimukha the maternal uncle his father, who was endowed with extraordinary might and who was rushing with speed with a tree in his hand."
5-62-26,"Blinded with arrogance, that Angada did not show any mercy to him on the score of his being the maternal uncle of his father and caused him at once to fall down and began to crush him against the ground."
5-62-27,"That Dadhimukha, the valiant elephant among the monkeys, who was afflicted with his broken arms, thighs and shoulders, drenched as he was in blood, lost his consciousness for a moment."
5-62-28,"That Dadhimukha, Sugreeva&#39;s maternal uncle, quickly recovering his breath, was enraged and resisted those monkeys, who were highly intoxicated because of drinking of honey, by a proper reprimand."
5-62-29,"Somehow released by those monkeys that Dadhimukha the foremost among the monkeys, went to a solitary place and spoke to his messengers who came there (as follows):"
5-62-30,"Let these monkeys stay here. We will go to the place where the thick-necked Sugreeva, our lord of the monkeys stays together with Rama."
5-62-31,"I will make known to the king, all the misdeed of Angada. Hearing my words, the enraged king will get the monkeys killed."
5-62-32,"This Madhuvana is indeed cherished by our high-souled king, Sugreeva and it derived from his father and grand father. It is so charming, but is dangerous to be approached even by celestials."
5-62-33,"The longevity of these monkeys got reduced, as they were very much lustful of honey. That Sugreeva can get these monkeys together with their companions, killed as a matter of punishment."
5-62-34,"These evil-minded beings, who disregarded the royal command, are fit to be capitally punished. Our wrath, springing from our impatience, will indeed become fruitful."
5-62-35,"Thus speaking to the garden-guards, the mighty Dadhimukha quickly springing up all at once, went (to Kishkindha) together with the garden-guards."
5-62-36,"That Dadhimukha, the monkey, reached the place where that Sugreeva, the intelligent monkey was there, within an interval of only a moment."
5-62-37,"Seeing Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva, Dadhimukha descended to a level ground, from the sky."
5-62-38,"That Dadhimukha of a great prowess, the supreme lord of the guards, surrounded by all those garden-guards keeping a sad face, made a respectful salutation to Sugreeva with his head, by falling down and touching with his head, the auspicious feet of Sugreeva."
5-63-1,"Just on seeing Dadhimukha, who fell touching his feet with his head, Sugreeva the chief of monkeys, with an agitated mind, spoke the following words:"
5-63-2,"O valiant monkey! Stand up, rise! Why have you fallen on my feet? I grant you immunity from fear. Let the entire truth be spoken!"
5-63-3,"Thus inspired by the high-souled Sugreeva with confidence, that highly intelligent Dadhimukha, rising up, spoke the following words:"
5-63-4,"O king! Madhuvana was indeed not set free previously at any time by Riksharajas, your father, or by you, or by even Vali. That Madhuvana has been consumed away by the monkeys."
5-63-5,"When these guards of the grove obstructed the monkeys, they disregarded the guards and continue to eat the fruits and drink the honey too."
5-63-6,"Some are throwing away a remnant of honey, after drinking it there and some others are consuming that remnant. When prevented by us, all of them are indeed exhibiting their eye-brows to us (in anger)."
5-63-7,"When these guards of the grove became angry and tried to keep them off from the grove, those enraged monkeys threatened them."
5-63-8,"O chief of monkeys! Then, those valiant monkeys in large numbers, having their red eyes in anger, drove away these monkeys."
5-63-9,"Those monkeys struck some of the guards with their hands. They beat some of them with their knees. They dragged some of them and tossed them into air."
5-63-10,"While you are in the position of a king, those monkeys have beaten these valiant guards and are eating away the entire Maduvana too."
5-63-11,"Lakshmana, the killer of hostile heroes and a very wise man, asked that Sugreeva, the excellent of monkeys (as follows) while Dadhimukha was thus reporting to him:"
5-63-12,"O king! Why has this monkey the garden-protector, come here?&#39; Pointing out what matter has this monkey in grief, spoken these words to you?"
5-63-13,"Hearing the words of the high-souled Lakshmana, the eloquent Sugreeva replied to him as follows:"
5-63-14,"O esteemed Lakshmana! Dadhimukha, the valiant monkey is informing that the foremost of monkeys, who returned from the southern direction, after searching for Seetha as also Angada and other heroes consumed honey."
5-63-15,"By seeing the manner in which these returned monkeys overpowered, destroyed and behaved towards Madhuvana, we can deduce that the monkeys would not have indulged in such an exploit, had they not accomplished my purpose."
5-63-16,"When those monkeys have overpowered Madhuvana, then it means that our task has been accomplished by the monkeys. Seetha was found. There is no doubt. None other than Hanuma must have seen Seetha."
5-63-17,"There is none other than, Hanuma who is the executor in accomplishing this work. In that Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, capacity to accomplish any object; intelligence; strenuous, vigour effort; and learning are well established in his life."
5-63-18,"Where Jambavan as well as Angada are leaders and Hanuma is an administrator, the progress of that work cannot be as otherwise."
5-63-19,"It is so reported that Madhuvana has been destroyed by the heroes with Angada as the chief and the garden-guards who were together preventing the damage, were beaten up with knees."
5-63-20,"To tell this matter in sweet words, the monkey renowned by Dadhimukha by name, with his celebrated prowess, has come here."
5-63-21,"O the long-armed Lakshmana! Perceive the truth that Seetha has been seen and see that all monkeys, getting together, are drinking honey."
5-63-22,"O Lakshmana, the foremost among men! If the renowned monkeys have not seen Seetha, they would not have abused the charming grove; which was granted as a boon."
5-63-23,"Then, the righteous Lakshmana, together with Rama, felt delighted. Hearing the words coming from the mouth of Sugreeva, which were pleasant for the ears, Rama was rejoiced. The mighty Lakshmana too was very much rejoiced."
5-63-24,"Hearing those words of Dadhimukha, Sugreeva with a charming neck, was very much pleased and further spoke to Dadhimukha, the guardian of the grove (as follows):"
5-63-25,"I am happy that Madhuvana has been enjoyed by those monkeys, who have accomplished their act. Since the act (damage to the grove) done by those monkeys, who have accomplished their purpose is fit to be forgiven, I pardon them."
5-63-26,"I, together with Rama and Lakshmana, soon desire to see those monkeys, with Hanuma as their chief, who having acquired the pride of a lion and who attained his purpose; and also to hear about their effort in finding out Seetha."
5-63-27,"Seeing Rama and Lakshmana with their eyes filled with ecstatic delight, the princes, who were thrilled with joy and who accomplished their aim, Sugreeva that king of the monkeys was very much delighted, knowing that accomplishment of their work is coming close to their hands and his limbs were thrilled with joy."
5-64-1,"Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Dadhimukha the monkey was pleased and offered his salutation with reverence to Rama, Lakshmana"
5-64-2,"After offering salutation to Sugreeva and to the mighty Rama and Lakshmana, that Dadhimukha accompanied by his valiant monkeys, sprang into the air."
5-64-3,"That Dadhimukha, after entering Madhuvana, saw all the chiefs of monkeys, who were free from their intoxication, having passed off the honey and who were inwardly excited."
5-64-4,"With his hands joined together for salutation, that valiant Dadhimukha approached them and cheerfully spoke the following gentle words to Angada."
5-64-5,"O gentle sir! Due to their ignorance, these guards in anger obstructed you to enter the grove. No resentment should be harboured by you about this obstruction."
5-64-6,"O exceedingly strong Angada! You are the prince and also the master of this grove. We have done a mistake"
5-64-7,"O faultless Angada! After going there, I indeed informed your uncle about the arrival of all these monkeys here."
5-64-8,"Hearing your arrival along with these leaders of monkeys, your uncle was exceedingly pleased. Even after hearing of Madhuvana having been attacked, he did not develop any anger."
5-64-9,"Sugreeva, your uncle, the lord of monkeys and the king was pleased and told me, &#39;send all the monkeys here&#39;."
5-64-10,"Hearing these smooth words of Dadhimukha, the eloquent Angada, the foremost among the monkeys, spoke to those monkeys as follows:"
5-64-11,"O the foremost of monkeys, the tormentators of enemies! I assume that Rama might have heard the news (of our arrival). Hence, it is not proper for us to remain here any longer, now that our work has been accomplished."
5-64-12,"The monkeys are taking, rest, after drinking the honey to their heart&#39;s content. What is there remaining, except to go to the place where Sugreeva my uncle is there?"
5-64-13,"I shall do whatever all the leaders of monkeys together tell me. I am obedient to you, in the matter of what ought to be done."
5-64-14,"I am not the master to command you, eventhough I am the crown prince. It is not befitting for me to play the lord over you, who have accomplished the task."
5-64-15,"Hearing the indeclinable words spoken thus by Angada, the monkeys with their pleased minds, spoke to him (as follows:"
5-64-16,"O prince, the foremost of monkeys! Who would speak like this, while he is the lord? Every one indeed thinks one&#39;s supremacy with an excited arrogance and says &#39;I, I&#39;."
5-64-17,"It is so worthy of you alone that you have spoken such words. None else can utter like this. Your humility itself is telling of your future suitableness for prosperity."
5-64-18,"All of us, who reached here, are waiting for the right moment to go to that place where Sugreeva, the imperishable king of the heroic monkeys, is."
5-64-19,"O the excellent of monkeys! Without your command, it is not possible for the monkeys anywhere, even a step forward. We are speaking this truth to you."
5-64-20,"While they were thus speaking; Angada replied, Let us go. The mighty monkeys then sprang into the air."
5-64-21,"All those leaders of monkey-troops, like stones shot from a catapult, making the space space-less, followed Angada, who was springing forward."
5-64-22,"Those monkeys with speed, sounding forth a loud noise, sprang into the sky, like clouds driven by the wind."
5-64-23,"Even before Angada landed there, Sugreeva, the king of monkeys spoke to the louts-eyed Rama, who was afflicted with grief (as follows):"
5-64-24,"Be pacified! Happiness to you! The princess has been seen. There is not doubt. When the time earlier fixed by us exceeds beyond limit, it is not possible for them to come here."
5-64-25,"Angada, the long-armed prince and the most excellent of monkeys does not make his appearance before my vicinity, if the work is ruined."
5-64-26,"Even if such an exploit may be possible by these monkeys who have not been able to accomplish their work, Angada would have worn a sad face and felt perplexed and scattered in mind."
5-64-27,"If Angada the lord f the monkeys is not rejoiced, he would not have damaged my madhuvana, which belongs to my father and grandfather as well as protected by my forbears. Get consoled well, O virtuous Rama, the splendid son of Kausalya!"
5-64-28,"Seetha was seen. There is no doubt. None other than Hanuma must have seen Seetha. There is indeed none other than Hanuma, who is the executor."
5-64-29,"O Rama, having a very good understanding! In Hanuma, qualities like capacity to accomplish any object, intelligence, strenuous effort and vigour are unchangeable, like a splendour in the sun."
5-64-30,"Where Jambavan is a leader; Angada as the commander of troops and moreover Hanuma as the administer, the progress of that work cannot be as otherwise."
5-64-31,"O Rama, of unlimited prowess! Do not encounter troubled thoughts now! Meanwhile, when the monkeys, who are proud of Hanuma&#39;s performance and who are making noise as though they are proclaiming about the accomplishment of their act are approaching Kishkindha Sugreeva heard certain sounds expressing joy, in the vicinity of the sky."
5-64-32,"Then, hearing that clamour of the monkeys, Sugreeva the chief of the monkeys became rejoiced at heart, duly stretching and curling up his tail (in joy)."
5-64-33,"Keeping Angada and Hanuma in front of them, those monkeys too arrived with their eagerness to see Rama."
5-64-34,"Those heroes, having Angada as their chief, exceedingly pleased as they were and filled with joy, landed at the vicinity of Sugreeva and Rama."
5-64-35,"Thereafter, the mighty armed Hanuma, offering his salutation in bending his head low, informed Rama that Seetha the princess is constant in devotion to Rama and sound in body."
5-64-36,"Hearing the nectar-like words, saying Seetha was found from the mouth of Hanuma, Rama and Lakshmana felt happy."
5-64-37,"Thereupon, Lakshmana with love looked with reverence on the joyful Sugreeva, who earlier decidedly apprised about the aforesaid Hanuma, having accomplished the task."
5-64-38,"Rama, the annihilator of hostile heroes, who obtained a great joy, looked on Hanuma with a high esteem."
5-65-1,"Keeping Angada the prince in their forefront those monkeys, on reaching Mount Prasravana having forests of variegated appearance, offered their salutation by bowing their heads in reverence to Rama and the mighty Lakshmana, greeting Sugreeva respectfully. Then, they started narrating the news of Seetha."
5-65-2,"Those monkeys started to narrate, in the presence of Rama, about, the female-demons, and frightening Seetha in Ravana&#39;s gynaecium, her complete affection towards Rama and the time-limit of two months given by Ravana."
5-65-3,"Hearing of Seetha being alive, Rama on his part replied, Where is Seetha, the princess? How is she disposed towards me? O monkeys! Tell me all that about Seetha."
5-65-4,"Hearing the words of Rama, the monkeys urged Hanuma to tell, in the presence of Rama, all the incidents because he knew them better, about Seetha."
5-65-5,"Hearing the words of those monkeys, the eloquent Hanuma, the son of wind-god saluting towards the direction of the Seetha the princess by bowing his head, spoke the following words, explaining how he saw Seetha."
5-65-6,"Having gone across the ocean, a hundred Yojanas wide, I reached the southern shore looking in search of Seetha, Janaka&#39;s daughter, with a wish to see her."
5-65-7,"There at the southern shore of the southern ocean, there is city called Lanka of the evil-minded Ravana."
5-65-8,"O Rama! There, living in Ravana&#39;s gynaecium in the city, I saw the lady Seetha, your virtuous wife, centering her heart&#39;s desire in you."
5-65-9,"In that pleasure garden, I saw Seetha sitting in the midst of female demons, guarded by those ugly-faced female-demons as also time and again being threatened by them."
5-65-10,"O hero! Seetha, who deserves to live happily with you, is obtaining grief. O Rama! I somehow searched that princess, Seetha wearing a single plait (as a as a mark of desolation), looking miserable, remaining absorbed in your thought, reposing on the floor, having discoloured limbs like a lotus in winter, turning back the wish from Ravana, having determined to die, but thinking of you alone."
5-65-11,"O faultless tiger among men! Seetha established confidence in me, after I slowly described to her the fame of Ikshvaku dynasty."
5-65-12,"Thereafter, I spoke and explained to Seetha, about the entire significance of my arrival there. On hearing about the alliance between Rama and Sugreeva, she was quite pleased. Her morality as well as her devotion in you are steadfast."
5-65-13,"O, the foremost of men! I thus saw that illustrious Seetha, endowed with severe penance and devotion towards you."
5-65-14,"O Rama, of great intelligence! To me, she gave as a token of remembrance, a previous event of a crow occurred at your vicinity in Mount Chitrakuta."
5-65-15,"Seetha spoke to me saying, &#39;O Hanuma! Inform Rama, the foremost among men, all that you have seen here."
5-65-16,"While Sugreeva is hearing nearby and while you are telling the words in this way, let this jewel, which is deliberately well-guarded, be given to Rama."
5-65-17,"This beautiful jewel for the head has been well-guarded by me. You also ought to recall a mark indeed painted by you (by slip) on the curve of my cheek with powder of an orange-red rock, when my former mark on my forehead got effaced."
5-65-18,"This beautiful jewel, which has its origin in sea-water, has been sent to you. Seeing this in my grief, I am feeling always happy as though I am seeing you."
5-65-19,"O Rama! I shall be sustaining my life for a month. Having come into the control of demons, I cannot survive beyond one month."
5-65-20,"Seetha, with her emaciated body, practicing virtue, confined in Ravana&#39;s gynaecium and with her wide-open eyes like that of a doe, spoke to me the following words:"
5-65-21,"O Rama! I have narrated to you whatever has occurred, in its entirety. Let a bridge be constructed, by all means, across the waters of the ocean."
5-65-22,"Coming to know that the two princes, Rama and Lakshmana have become confident and having given that token of remembrance to Rama, Hanuma apprised completely in so many words, in regular succession, all that was conveyed by Seetha, the princess."
5-66-1,"Hearing the words of Hanuma, Rama the son of Dasaratha, having Lakshmana by his side, pressing that jewel on his bosom, began to weep."
5-66-2,"Seeing that excellent jewel, Rama emaciated with grief, having his eyes filled with tears, spoke to Sugreeva as follows:"
5-66-3,"Even as a cow, who is affectionate towards her offspring, gushes forth the milk (from her teats) due to her love at the very sight of her calf, so does my heart too melt through the sight of this excellent jewel."
5-66-4,"This excellent jewel was presented by my father-in-law to Seetha when she had become a bride and was tied to her head in such a way that it looked additionally beautifying."
5-66-5,"The jewel, which was found in the waters and recommended by the good, had been presented to him earlier by the intelligent Indra the lord of celestials, who was highly pleased in Yajna, a sacrificial rite (intended to propitiate him)."
5-66-6,"O gentle Sugreeva! Seeing now this excellent jewel, I am considering it as surely as obtaining the sight of my father as well as Janaka, the king of Videha."
5-66-7,"This jewel indeed looks splendid on the head of my beloved Seetha. By seeing this now, I am considering as though I obtained the sight of Seetha herself."
5-66-8,"O gentle one! Repeat again and again, what Seetha the daughter of Videha&#39;s king said to you, sprinkling me with your stream of words, like offering water to a thirsty person."
5-66-9,"O Lakshmana! What could be more painful than the fact that I am seeing this jewel found in waters, without the arrival of Seetha?"
5-66-10,"O gentle one! If Seetha can survive for a month, it means that she is surviving for long. O gentle one! Without that black-eyed Seetha, I cannot survive for even a moment."
5-66-11,"Take me too to that place where my beloved Seetha has been seen. I cannot halt even for a moment, after receiving the news of her location."
5-66-12,"How does Seetha, my virtuous wife with her charming limbs, who is very shy, stay all the time with demons who are terrific and cruel?"
5-66-13,"Her countenance, surely like automnal moon, though liberated of darkness, but screened by clouds, does not shine at present."
5-66-14,"O Hanuma! Tell me now, correctly what Seetha told you. I shall surely survive, by hearing her words, even as a sick man would with the help of a medicine."
5-66-15,"Tell me, what my beautiful consort, who is sweet-natured, and who utters sweet words, having fine hips and has been separated from me, said to you."
5-67-1,"Hearing the words of the high-souled Rama, Hanuma reported to Rama, all the words spoken by Seetha."
5-67-2,"O Rama the foremost of men! Seetha, the princess, spoke a detailed account of an event which occurred long ago in Mount Chitrakuta, as a token of recollection."
5-67-3,"Seetha, who slept happily by your side (at one instance) got up before you. A crow coming down quickly, tore her flesh at an area in the midst of her breasts (with its beak)."
5-67-4,"O Rama! You slept in your turn on the lap of the princess. That crow again began to torment the princess."
5-67-5,"Coming near again and again, it tore her breast severely. Dampened by her blood, you then were awakened by her."
5-67-6,"O tormentator of enemies! Though lying happily asleep, you were awakened by Seetha the princess, who was being ceaselessly tormented by the crow."
5-67-7,"O long-armed Rama! Seeing her, who was lacerated at the midst of her breasts, you were enraged like a hissing snake and spoke to her as follows."
5-67-8," &#39;O bashful Seetha! By whom was the middle of your breasts lacerated with nail-points? Who is playing with an angry five-hooded serpent?"
5-67-9,"Looking around, you suddenly saw a crow, which perched in front of Seetha, with its sharp nails stained with blood."
5-67-10,"That crow, foremost of the birds was indeed the son of Indra the lord of celestials; dwelling in the middle of the mountains and equal in speed to the wind."
5-67-11,"O great armed Rama, the excellent among the wise! With your eyes rolling with anger, you then harboured a cruel intention against that crow."
5-67-12,"Taking a blade of grass from your bed of the sacred grass, you charged it with the potency of Brahma missile. That flaming blade blazed forth like the fire of universal dissolution, with its end facing the bird."
5-67-13,"You hurled that flaming blade of grass towards the crow. Then that flaming blade of grass for its part followed the crow."
5-67-14,"Forsaken by all the celestials, Indra, its father and the sages too, that crow did not find a protector even after going round all the three worlds (heaven, earth and the lower regions)."
5-67-15,"O destroyer of enemies! Being frightened the crow came to your presence once again and sough your protection. Though fit to be killed, you on your part, affording shelter, in mercy to the crow, protected that crow which had fallen flat on the ground."
5-67-16,"&#39;O Rama! Since it is not possible to make the missile a waste, you destroyed the right eye of the crow."
5-67-17,"O Rama! Then, that crow, having been discharged by you, went back to its own habitation, after offering salutation to you and to king Dasaratha."
5-67-18,"O Rama! Why are you not employing the same type of a missile on the demons, though you are the foremost among the wielders of missiles, though courageous and possessed of good disposition?"
5-67-19,"Neither the Nagas the celestials serpents nor even Gandharvas the celestial musicians nor the demons nor the troop of Maruts the host of gods, nor all of them joined together are capable of fighting with Rama."
5-67-20,"If that powerful Rama is eager to save me, let him kill Ravana in battle quickly with his exceptionally sharp arrows."
5-67-21,"Why even that Lakshmana, the annihilator of adversaries and the foremost of men born in Raghu dynasty is not saving me, by taking orders from Rama his brother?"
5-67-22,"Wherefore those two competent brothers Rama and Lakshmana, with their splendour equal to that of air and fire, and excellent among men, even though they can conquer the celestials, are ignoring me?"
5-67-23,"There is no doubt that I had done some big impure act, for which reason those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, who torment the enemies, even though capable, are not paying attention to me."
5-67-24,"Hearing the miserable words of Seetha spoken with tears, I again spoke to that venerable Seetha the following words:"
5-67-25," &#39;O Seetha the princess! Rama has grown indifferent because of grief born of separation from you. I swear it to you truly. Rama, being overwhelmed with grief, Lakshmana too is feeling pain."
5-67-26," &#39;O faultless one! You can give now, a token of recollection, which Rama can recognize and which can beget happiness to him."
5-67-27," &#39;Those two princes, the foremost among men and the faultless ones are eager to see you. They can reduce Lanka to ashes&#39;."
5-67-28," &#39;O lady with charming hips! Killing the terrific Ravana together with his relatives in battle, Rama will certainly take you to his City of Ayodhya&#39;."
5-67-29," &#39;O faultless one! You can give now, a token of recollection, which Rama can recognize and which can beget happiness to him."
5-67-30,"O mighty Rama! Having surveyed all the directions and having untied from the end of her garment, this excellent jewel which was being strung together in her hair that Seetha gave it to me."
5-67-31,"O Rama! Taking that wonderful jewel for your sake from her, and offering my salutation by bowing my head to that venerable Seetha, I was seized with a haste to come back."
5-67-32,"Seeing me who was in a hurry to come back and augmenting my body abundantly, Seetha having a beautiful complexion spoke to me."
5-67-33,"With her eyes filled with tears, looking miserable, with her words ambiguously coming out of her coked throat, bewildered as she was, at the though of my flying away and afflicted with a gush of grief; (she spoke to me as follows):"
5-67-34,"O Hanuma! Inquire those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana looking like lions, Sugreeva together with his ministers and all others about their welfare."
5-67-35," &#39;You ought to clear up difficulties for that mighty armed Rama, so that he can help me to cross this ocean of sorrow. O best of heroes among monkeys! Approaching Rama, tell this horrible gush of my grief and the threats of these female-demons. Have a happy journey!&#39; O illustrious princes, the protector of men! The venerable Seetha filled with sorrow spoke these words to be conveyed to you. Comprehending this matter spoken by me, believe that Seetha is completely safe."
5-68-1,"O excellent among men! Having shown respect for me out of her affection and good-heartedness for you, I, who was in a haste to go, was spoken to again by Seetha the princess about the further course of action."
5-68-2,"Rama, the son of Dasaratha, is to be informed by you thus in several ways, for quickly killing Ravana in battle and also as to how he can get me back."
5-68-3," &#39;O hero the annihilator of enemies! If you deem it fit, stay for a day in a secret place. You can go tomorrow after taking rest&#39;."
5-68-4,"&#39;O the valiant one! Because of your presence, the termination of my full-blown grief may continue for a while&#39;."
5-68-5,"&#39;When you, the courageous one, have actually left to come back, there will be a danger even to my life. There is no doubt about this&#39;."
5-68-6,"&#39;The sorrow born of your disappearance will further torment me, who is overtaken by one sorrow after another, miserable and doomed to grief as I am&#39;."
5-68-7,"&#39;O best among the monkeys! O valiant one! In the matter of monkeys and bears who are your helpmates, this very grave doubt stands before me&#39;."
5-68-8,"&#39;How indeed can those troops of monkeys and bears or Rama and Lakshmana can cross that great insurmountable ocean?&#39;"
5-68-9,"&#39;Three beings viz. Garuda the eagle, or yourself or the wind-god only have the capacity of crossing this ocean&#39;."
5-68-10,"&#39;O valiant monkey! That is why, what strategy are you visualizing to fulfill this act, which is so difficult to accomplish thus? You are indeed excellent of those who know how to accomplish any work&#39;."
5-68-11,"O Hanuma the annihilator of hostile enemies! You, as one alone, are capable of fulfilling this task. Your act of fulfilling this task your act of fulfilling the result is well-known."
5-68-12,"It would result in his glory, if Rama, after killing Ravana along with his entire army, takes me to his city in his victory&#39;."
5-68-13,"&#39;Rama ought not to take me back for fear that Ravana, in the same manner as Ravana the demon took me away from the forest in the absence of Rama by cheating that heroic Rama."
5-68-14,"If Rama, the destroyer of rival army, fills the entire Lanka with arrows and takes me home, it will be quite worthy of him."
5-68-15,"For that reason, you act in such a way, that the high-souled Rama, valiant in battle, exhibits the prowess befitting of him."
5-68-16,"Hearing that appeal (of Seetha), that was somewhat good in its meaning, courteous and duly furnished with reasons, I gave then my remaining reply (as follows):"
5-68-17,"&#39;O Seetha the princess! Sugreeva, the lord of the troops of monkeys and bears, excellent among the monkeys and endowed with strength, is firmly determined to rescue you."
5-68-18,"So many monkeys, endowed with prowess, perseverance great strength and who can rush to any place as they wish, are intensely committed to Sugreeva&#39;s command. There is no hindrance to their movement either in the sky or the ground or in a horizontal region between the sky and the ground. Those monkeys with unlimited splendour are not indolent in performing any great task."
5-68-19,"Those illustrious monkeys, proud of their strength and following the path of wind, circumambulated the entire earth several times."
5-68-20,"&#39;In them, some of the monkeys are superior to me and some are even equal to me. No one in the vicinity of Sugreeva is inferior to me. When I have arrived here, why to talk about those mighty ones? Generally, superior ones are not sent for errands. Only others are indeed sent&#39;."
5-68-21,"&#39;O Seetha the princess! Enough of your lamentation. Take away your sorrow. Those leaders of monkeys will reach Lanka by one single leap&#39;."
5-68-22,"Rama and Lakshmana, those two lions among men, also of great strength, ascending on my shoulders, can come to you, like the rising sun and the moon."
5-68-23,"Rama, the annihilator of enemies, similar to a lion, and Lakshmana wielding a bow in his hand, will surely approach the entrance-gate of Lanka and you will see them soon."
5-68-24,"&#39;You can see soon those valiant monkeys, with their claws and tusks as weapons, having the prowess of lions and tigers and looking like lordly elephants, coming here together&#39;."
5-68-25,"&#39;You will hear within a short time, the clamour of the excellent of monkeys resonating like a mountains and clouds, on the peaks of Mount Malaya in Lanka&#39;."
5-68-26,"&#39;You will see Rama, the annihilator of enemies, returning from exile, and getting anointed to the crown in Ayodhya, along with you soon&#39;."
5-68-27,"Thereafter, soothened by me with comforting, well-disposed and agreeable words, Seetha, though tormented with thought of your grief, obtained peace of mind."
6-1-1,"Touched with joy to hear the words rightly spoken by Hanuman, Rama replied asfollows: -"
6-1-2,"A very outstanding work, the most arduous in the world has been done by Hanuman,which could not be carried out even in thought by any other on the surface of this earth."
6-1-3,"Indeed, I cannot perceive as such anyone other than Garuda (chief of the featheredrace and vehicle of Lord Vishnu), wind- god and Hanuman, who can cross the mighty ocean."
6-1-4,"Who can return alive, having entered (once) taking refuge only in self- command,the city of Lanka, which is unconquerable by gods demons and Yakshas and even by Gandharvas, Nagasand ogres and well under the custody of Ravana?"
6-1-5,"Who is able to capture that citadel, by assault, that is exceedingly dangerous tobe attacked and which is powerfully guarded by ogres, but one whose courage and valour are equal toHanuman's?"
6-1-6,"A great act of service has been done by Hanuman to Sugriva thus by exhibiting hisstrength corresponding to his pace."
6-1-7,"That servant to whom his master entrusts a difficult task and who performs it withzeal is said to be a superior person."
6-1-8,"The one who is ready and capable but who yet does no more than his master extractsfrom him is called a mediocre person."
6-1-9,"The one who is well and able and yet does not carry out the instructions of hismaster as directed is said to be the least of men ."
6-1-10,"Through the discovery of Sita's retreat by this faithful messenger, Hanuman hasfulfilled the task entrusted to him unfalteringly to the satisfaction of Sugriva and hence therewas no diminution to his self."
6-1-11,"By finding out Sita, the Raghu dynasty as well as myself and the valiant Lakshmanatoo, have been rightly saved today."
6-1-12,"But it squeezes my conscience further, hopeless as I am, to think that I am notable to do a pleasant act befittingly to the bearer of these good tidings."
6-1-13,"Let me at least embrace this magnanimous Hanuman since in the presentcircumstances, this is all that is easily obtained from me."
6-1-14,"Thus saying, Rama vibrating with joy, clasped Hanuman in his arms who, master ofhimself, his mission fulfilled, had returned."
6-1-15,"After reflecting a while, Rama the great scion of Raghus, again spoke as follows,Sugriva the ruler of monkeys too listening attentively."
6-1-16,"The search for Sita has been performed so much well in all ways. But my mind getsdejected once more, when I behold this vast ocean."
6-1-17,"How can these monkeys put together will reach the southern bank of the ocean, whichis so difficult to cross and which contains voluminous water?"""
6-1-18,"Having received the tidings of Sita, what can now be done to take the monkeys tothe farther side the sea?"
6-1-19,"Thus speaking to Hanuman, Rama the destroyer of enemies and the mighty armed, wasfilled with apprehension and then became absorbed in thought."
6-2-1,"The glorious Sugreeva made the following reply, which was intended to expel hisgrief, to Rama the son of Dasaratha who felt miserable with anguish."
6-2-2,"Oh, hero! Why are you lamenting thus, as any other ordinary man? Do not besorrowful like this. Abandon your grief, as an ungrateful man abandons friendship."
6-2-3,"As the information about Seetha has since been gathered, I do not indeed see anyscope for your grief Oh, Rama!"
6-2-4,"Oh, Rama! You are a wise person, a knower of sacred works, an intellectual and alearned man. Give up these ordinary apprehensions like a man whose spirit is disciplined gives upideas which spoil the purpose."
6-2-5,"We shall make our way up to Lanka, by crossing the ocean filled with largecrocodiles. We shall destroy your enemy."
6-2-6,"All action get dissipated by a person who is non-enthusiastic, depressed anddisturbed with grief. Such a person gets into troubles too."
6-2-7,"These leaders of monkey squads are gallant and efficient in all ways. They areenthusiastic even to enter a fire for your sake. I understand this from their joy and my reasoningtoo is sound."
6-2-8,"You ought to act in every way that I may be able to get back Seetha, afterdestroying by an attack the enemy Ravana of sinful deeds."
6-2-9,"You take steps in such a way that a bridge is constructed across the sea and wereach that city of the king of ogres."
6-2-10,"Be certain that Ravana is killed, once he is seen in a battle and on our seeingthat city of Lanka standing on a peak of the Trikuta Mountain."
6-2-11,"Without building a bridge across the sea, the dreadful abode of Varuna (the god ofwater), Lanka cannot be defeated even by gods and demons including Indra."
6-2-12,"Know that when the whole of my army crosses the sea as a bridge is built across it,they will come out victorious, because these monkeys who are able to change their form at will areindeed valiant in battle."
6-2-13,"Therefore, take away your apprehensive mind, which destroys any enterprise forgrief in this world diminishes the might of a man, Oh king!"
6-2-14,"�Cling to the practice of boldness, ought to be resorted to by a man. It willproduce competence without doubt to the doer quickly."""
6-2-15,"Prevail upon the strength with alertness at this moment, Oh highly intelligentprince! Grief for something lost or destroyed consumes all resources of even the strong andmagnanimous men like you."
6-2-16,"You are the foremost among the intelligent and the knower of all sacred texts.Hence, you ought to defeat the enemy, with allies like me."
6-2-17,"I do not indeed see any one who can withstand you in a battle filed in the threeworlds, when you are armed with a bow, Oh Rama!"
6-2-18,"You work duly entrusted to the monkeys will not be spoiled. You shall behold Seethaera imperishable sea."
6-2-19,"Oh, Lord of the earth! Desist from this melancholy. Yield to your legitimateindignation. Unadventurous Kshatriyas (members of warrior-tribe) never win honor but all fear thewrathful."
6-2-20,"You with your resourceful mind, along with us together, ponder over now a design tocross the sea, the terrible Lord of rivers."
6-2-21,"Know victory to be certain, once the sea has been crossed by the army. Verily whenall my forces have passed over the sea our triumph is assured!"
6-2-22,"These monkeys, the courageous soldiers who are able to change their form at theirvolition, will crush their opponents with an avalanche of rocks and trees."
6-2-23,"Once we have crossed the sea (the abode of Varuna) by whatever the means employed,Ravana is as definitely killed in my eyes, Oh exterminator of enemies!"
6-2-24,"What is the use of all these words? By all means, you will be a victorious man. Isee good omens and my heard is over thrilled with joy."""
6-3-1,"Hearing the well-founded and highly reasonable words of Sugreeva, Rama concurredwith him and spoke then to Hanuma as follows:"
6-3-2,"I am competent of crossing this ocean by all means, either by way of austerity orby forming a bridge or by drying up the ocean."
6-3-3,"Tell me how many citadels in Lanka are difficult of access, Oh, Hanuma! I desire toknow all that, as though viewed with an eye."
6-3-4,"You had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the size of the army, thefortification-details of the gates and citadels, the way in which Lanka was guarded and the variousmansions of ogres. Describe everything in accordance with facts, for you are skilled in allways."
6-3-5,"Hearing the words of Rama, Hanuma the son of wind-god, who was excellent in the artof expression, forthwith spoke once more to Rama as follows:"
6-3-6,"Listen to me! I shall tell you everything-how the city of Lanka has been defendedby the various methods of fortification and how it has been guarded by the troops."
6-3-7,"I shall tell you the details of how the ogres are attached to their king, theexcellent prosperity of Lanka generated by the glory of Ravana, the awfulness of the ocean, thedivision of the body of his forces and of animals like horses and elephants carrying his forcesother than the infantry. Saying so, Hanuma the foremost among monkeys, who knew the truth narratedas follows."
6-3-8,"The great Lanka was rejoiced and gayful, full of elephants in rut, abounding inchariots and inhabited by gangs of ogres."
6-3-9,"Four fairly big and extensive gates are fitted with strong doors along with hugebeams for locking those gates."
6-3-10,"Strong and mighty ballista capable of hurling darts and stones have been attachedto them. The enemy troops which arrive there are warded off by those catapults at the verygates."
6-3-11,"Dangerous and sharp edged Sataghnis made of iron, forged by hordes of ogres, havebeen kept in readiness in hundreds at the gates."
6-3-12,"A great rampart made of gold, which is difficult to assail with violence and isinlaid at intervals with gems, corals, cat's eyes and pearls, encircle that Lanka."
6-3-13,"Most awe-inspiring and fathomless moats (deep trenches) of great splendor, filledwith cold water, infested with alligators and inhabited by fishes are there all round thecity."
6-3-14,"Anterior to the gateways, there are four very extensive draw-bridges, equipped withnumerous engines and furnished with many rows of buildings (built on the rampart and meant forthose entrusted with the duty of guarding the entrances)."
6-3-15,"Against the approach of the enemy forces there, the draw-bridges are protected bythe aforesaid engines and the enemy-battalions are flung into the moats on every side."
6-3-16,"The most important draw-bridge which is unshakable, firmly fastened very well andstrong, is dazzling with numerous gold pillars and pedestals."
6-3-17,"Ravana, inclined to war and endowed with powers of the state, himself remains alertand in readiness to review the forces, Oh, Rama!"
6-3-18,"Lanka therefore is impregnable, it is a celestial citadel, that inspires terror.Surrounded by water and built on a mountain, it has four fold defenses including forest andartificial fortification."
6-3-19,"Lanka is situated on the other side of the ocean, which is difficult of access, OhRama! It offers no passage for vehicles either and there is no proper communication from allsides."
6-3-20,"That city of Lanka, resembling the city of Gods, is built on a mountain peak and isinaccessible. That Lanka is abound with horses and elephants and is extremely difficult toconquer."
6-3-21,"Deep trenches and Sataghnis too as well as engines of war of every kind adorn Lankathe city of wicked Ravana."""
6-3-22,"Ten thousand ogres all carrying darts in their hands and warriors contending withswords, who are difficult to assail, are positioned at the eastern gate."
6-3-23,"One hundred thousand of ogres, with an army of four limbs (viz. horses, footsoldiers, elephants and chariots) are positioned at the southern gate of the city. Warriorsunsurpassed by others constitute that army."

6-3-26,"Moreover, ogres hundreds of thousands in number, difficult to attack, aggregatingto one and quarter of a crore of ogres are positioned at the central division."
6-3-27,"Those bridges were broken by me and the moats were filled up (with the wreckage).The city of Lanka was burnt by me and the defensive walls were pulled down. A part of the army ofthe gigantic ogres was destroyed."
6-3-28,"By some way or other, let us cross the ocean. The city of Lanka should be assumedthen as destroyed by the monkeys."
6-3-29,"Oh, Rama! What is the use for the rest of the forces to you? Angada, Divida,Mainda, Jambavan, Panasa, Anala and Nila the commander-in-chief alone, by reaching that great cityof Ravana leaping and storming Lanka with its mountains and woods, moats and archways, protectivewalls and buildings, will recover Seetha."
6-3-30,"Order quickly to get all the forces accumulated accordingly. Let us set out at theappropriate moment."
6-4-1,"Rama, a very bright man and a true warrior, having duly heard the words of Hanuman from the beginning, thereafter spoke as follows:"
6-4-2,"I shall destroy quickly Lanka, the city of that terrible ogre (Ravana), of which you just informed I am really telling this."
6-4-3,"Be pleased to approve our march at this moment, a suitable moment for success. The sun reached the mid-day."
6-4-4,"Let that ogre go (to his abode) after kidnapping Seetha. Where will he go alive? Hearing of my march to Lanka, Seetha will get back her hope in life, like a sick man having drunk poison touches ambrosia at the end of his life."
6-4-5,"This northern planet of Phalguni will be in conjunction with the Hasta star tomorrow. Hence, let us depart today itself with all the troops accompanying us, Oh, Sugreeva!"
6-4-6,"By seeing the omens which are becoming visible, I deduce that I shall bring back Seetha the daughter of Janaka, by killing Ravana."
6-4-7,"My eye which is twitching on the upper lid, is proclaiming as it were, my desire of victory coming nearer."
6-4-8,"Then Rama the virtuous man versed in moral law, who was well-adored by Sugreeva the king of monkeys and Lakshmana, again spoke as follows:-"
6-4-9,"Let general Nila accompanied by strength of hundred thousand warriors go before the army, to explore the way."
6-4-10,"Oh Nila the chief of Army! Steer the army speedily by the path, abound with fruits and roots, cool woods and fresh water and honey."
6-4-11,"The evil-minded demons may spoil the roots, fruits and water in the path-way. You always try to be on you guard."
6-4-12,"Let the monkeys jump into law grounds, into places made inaccessible by forest-grores and into thickets and notice whether any rival forces are stationed there."
6-4-13,"Let whatever little of feeble forces stay back in Kishkindha, as our operation will indeed be dreadful. It has to be discharged daringly."
6-4-14,"Let the best of monkeys with great strength in hundreds and thousands lead the formidable of the army, which is akin to an oceanic stream."
6-4-15,"Let Gaja, equal to a mountain, Gavaya a very strong warrior and Gavaksha march in front, as a majestic bull marches in front of a cow-herd."
6-4-16,"Let the monkey called Rishabha, Lord of the simians and the best of the primates march forward, duly guarding the right side of the army of the simians."
6-4-17,"Let Gandhamadana, with a strength unconquerable like an elephant in rut, proceed duly guarding the left side of the army of monkeys."
6-4-18,"I myself, mounted on the shoulders of Hanuman, like Indra on Airavata, will march in the centre of my troops, duly cheering the multitude of army."
6-4-19,"Let this Lakshmana, resembling the lord of Death, march on the shoulders of Angada like Kubera the lord of riches and the sovereign of beings marches on an elephant called Sarvabhauma."
6-4-20,"Let the highly strong, Jambavan with Sushena and the monkey called Vegadarshi, all three, guard the middle part of the army."
6-4-21,"Hearing the words of Rama, Sugreeva with great valour, the commander of forces and the lion among monkeys gave orders to the monkeys accordingly."
6-4-22,"Then, all those troops of monkeys with great speed together raised up and quickly bounced from caves and mountain-tops."
6-4-23,"Thereafter Rama the virtuous man, treated respectfully by Sugreeva and Lakshmana, moved towards southern direction, along with the army."
6-4-24,"At that time, Rama went surrounded by monkeys, looking like elephants, numbering in hundreds, hundreds of thousands and crores."
6-4-25,"That extensive army of monkeys followed Rama who was marching in the lead. All those monkeys maintained by Sugreeva were rejoicing with delight."

6-4-35,"Nila their chief of the army, the brave and the best among monkeys, the self controlled and the foremost among movable beings, was protecting atha army in every direction."
6-4-36,"Valimukha, Prajangha, Jambha and Rabhasa the monkey were moving on all sides, urging the monkeys forward."
6-4-37,"Those foremost among the monkeys, proud of their strength, thus marching with the army, saw the Sahya mountain the best of mountains joined with many small mountains, lakes fully abounding in flowers and eminent ponds."
6-4-38,"That large army of monkeys, terrific like an ocean-flood cognizing the command of Rama which is frightfully enraging, having terror-stricken, abandoning the vicinity of towns and even villages, marched like a highly dreadful ocean with a great hoaring sound."
6-4-39,"All those prominent and valiant monkeys were overwhelmingly jumping ahead, like fine horses being whipped, at the side of that Rama."
6-4-40,"Rama and Lakshmana the best among men being carried on shoulders by Hanuman and Angada the two monkeys, were effulgent like the moon and the sun having come together in contact with two large planets (Jupiter and Venus)."
6-4-41,"Thereafter, Rama the virtuous man, treated respectfully by Sugreeva and Lakshmana, moved towards southern direction, along with the army. Lakshmana, with a fully meaningful presence of mind, sitting on Angada, spoke the following auspicious words which were fully meaningful, to Rama."
6-4-42,"Killing Ravana fast and obtaining Seetha who was taken away, you will proceed to Ayodhya which is abundant by rich, having accomplished your purpose."
6-4-43,"I am seeing all grand good omens in the sky and the earth self-evident of your fulfillment, Oh Rama! The wind which is favorable, gentle beneficial and comfortable to the army is blowing alongside."
6-4-44,"These beasts and birds are uttering sonorous and sweet sounds. All the quarters are looking bright. Even the sun is clear."
6-4-45,"The planet of Venus with its bright light, born from the sage Bhrigu (a mind-born son of Brahma the creator) is hanging behind you. Dhruva, the very bright pole-star (which is recognized by the contiguity of the stars presided over by the seven Brahmana sages) is becoming clear. All the pure great sages having bright light are shining are shining around Dhruva star."

6-4-48,"The Mula constellation of the titans is badly aspected, in that it is touched by a comet risen with a tail of light and tormented by it."
6-4-49,"All this has come for the destruction of the titans, for, the star seized by death is oppressed by a planet in its last hour."
6-4-50,"The waters are crystal-clear, with good taste. The woodlands are laden with fruit. The fragrant air is not blowing much. Trees are bearing seasonal flowers."
6-4-51,"The armies of monkeys formed into different squadrons are looking highly splendid like the armies of celestials in the battle in which the demon Taraka was killed, Oh venerable one! Be pleased to see these good omens in this manner."
6-4-52,"The delighted Lakshmana spoke thus, cheering up his brother. Then, the army of monkeys consisting of excellent bears and monkeys having their very nails and teeth as weapons, marched ahead, covering the entire earth."
6-4-53,"The aweful dust raised by nails and claws of monkeys obscured the splendor of the sun and also covered the earth comprising of mountains forests and the atmosphere. The colossal monkey-army advanced, encompassing the southern region like a mass of cloud enveloping the sky."

6-4-55,"The mighty army entered thoroughly into lakes containing clear water, mountains full of trees, plain-landed territories and forests laden with fruits from the middle, from the four sides, from across and from under."
6-4-56,"The gigantic army marched, thoroughly covering the land. All of them with a wind-like aped went on, manifesting a joy in their faces."
6-4-57,"For the sake of Rama, the monkeys with fully elevated pace vied with each other in high spirits, vigor and prowess. Out of pride born of prime youth, some made various gestures on the way."
6-4-58,"Some wild monkeys there walked very speedily. In that manner, some others hovered highly. Some made noises, sounding kila! kila!."
6-4-59,"Some monkeys lashed their tails. Some even stamped their feet. Some others, stretching their arms, broke off rocks and trees."
6-4-60,"Some monkeys ascended mountain-peaks and uttered huge noises. Some others made lion&#39;s roars."

6-4-63,"That extensive monkey-army was marching day and night. All the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva were exceedingly pleased and cheerful. All were marching quickly, rejoicing for war. Those monkeys desirous of Seetha&#39;s release, did not halt even for a moment anywhere."
6-4-64,"Then, those monkeys reached and climbed up a mountain called sahya with a full canopy of trees and filled with many kinds of beasts."
6-4-65,"Rama too went along, seeing the wonderful woods, streams and cascades of Sahya and Malaya mountains."

6-4-69,"A soft-touching breeze, refreshing as a sandal, blew while the bees hummed in the nectar-scented woods."

There were beautiful reservoirs of water with blossoming blue lotuses, water lilies, white water lilies, black water lilies and various other kinds of aquatic flowers."
6-4-73,"Various kinds of birds sang in those mountain-peaks. Monkeys bathed in water, drank those waters and played. They ascended the mountain and got drenched in water, by sprinkling water by one over the other among themselves."
6-4-74,"Monkeys in mad rut plucked sweet-smelling fruits, roots and flowers there."
6-4-75,"Those monkeys, in reddish brown colour like honey, drinking honey from honey-combs weighing about a maund each, went on cheerfully."
6-4-76,"Those foremost among the monkeys marched, breaking off trees, pulling along creepers and throwing away excellent mountains."
6-4-77,"Some other monkeys, well-pleased with honey got from trees, yelled loudly. Some others reached trees to get honey. Some others were drinking honey excessively."
6-4-78,"The earth filled with those excellent monkeys, was like land filled with ripened fields of paddy."
6-4-79,"Then, the lotus-eyed and the mighty-armed Rama reached Mahendra mountain and ascended its top, adorned with trees."
6-4-80,"Then, Rama the son of Dasartha mounted the peak and saw an ocean ruffled with water and scattered well with turtles and fishes."
6-4-81,"They crossed Sahya mountain and Malaya mountain and systematically approached the ocean having terrific sound."
6-4-82,"Rama the foremost of those who entrance the mind, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana quickly descended the mountain and went to the excellent woodland adjoining the sea."
6-4-83,"Then Rama reached the extensive ocean with rocks underneath washed by floods of water risen vehemently and spoke these words."
6-4-84,"Oh, Sugreeva! We have reached the abode of Varuna. We should consider now the matter (of how to cross the ocean) with which we were formerly preoccupied."
6-4-85,"This ocean, the lord of Rivers, is shore less beyond. This sea is impossible to be crossed without a proper strategy."
6-4-86,"For this reason, let the military be assembled here only. Here, let us discuss the plan how this military of monkeys will reach the other shore."
6-4-87,"Rama, the mighty armed, emaciated due to taking away of Seetha, then reached the sea and ordered thus for the halt of the army there."
6-4-88,"Let all the army be stationed at the sea-shore, Sugreeva! Here, the time has come for us to think about the subject of crossing the ocean."
6-4-89,"Let not anyone slip away in any direction, leaving his respective unit of army. Let valiant monkeys make a more and it should be known whether there is a hidden danger for us."
6-4-90,"Hearing Rama&#39;s words, Sugreeva along with Lakshmana made the army to halt at the sea-shore, stretched with trees."
6-4-91,"That army, stationed at the vicinity of the ocean, shined like a second ocean splendid with yellowish white honey-coloured water."
6-4-92,"There, those foremost of monkeys reached the woodlands at the shore and settled down, desiring to reach the other shore of the vast sea."
6-4-93,"While all the monkeys were halting there, the noise created out of their movement was dominantly heard, concealing the roar of the sea."
6-4-94,"That army of the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva, stationed as three divisios (viz. 1. bears 2. long tailed monkes and 3. monkeys) looked fully dedicated to the cause of Rama."
6-4-95,"That army of monkeys reached the mighty ocean and was delighted to behold the mighty ocean being diffused by the velocity of wind."
6-4-96,"Seeing the sea, the abode of Varuna, which was boundless and having the opposite shore far off, inhabitd by a number of demons, the monkey-troups sat down there."
6-4-97,"Rendered appalling by the ferocity of fierce alligators and crocodiles, that ocen with its foaming waves at the end of the day and at the beginning of the night, appeared to laugh and dance."
6-4-98,"The ocean surged, when the moon rose. The image of moon was reflected limitlessly in it. The sea was full of huge alligators swift as fierce winds along with whales and great fish."
6-4-99,"That sea, the abode of Varuna was filled with serpents bestowed with flaming hoods, plunged with mighty aquatic creatures, abounding in various types of mountains, too difficult to cross, with an inaccessible path, suffocationly fathomless and an abode of demons."
6-4-100,"Increasing waves of the sea in which sharks and bodies of serpents swarmed, rose and fell whipped into motion by the breeze."
6-4-101,"Emitting whirled sparkles, shining with large water-snakes, a fearful abode of enemies of gods forever, the sea reaches upto the uneven Patala (subterranean region)."
6-4-102,"The ocean looked like the sky. The sky looked like the ocean. The ocean and the sky looked alike without any distinction."
6-4-103,"The water blended with sky and the sky blended with water. Filled with stars above and the pearls below, both the sky and the sea looked with the same splendour."
6-4-104,"There was no distinction between the two, of the sea filled with a row of waves and of the sky with a row of falling clouds."
6-4-105,"The waves of the ocean together banging one another with a terrific resonance, sounded like a kettle-drum in the sky."
6-4-106,"Those high-souled monkeys saw the sea lashed with winds, resonating with abundance of precious stones and water, rising high as if enraged in a grip of hurricane, filled with a number of aquatic creatures and tossed by them in the air by seemingly murmuring waves."
6-4-107,"The standing monkeys were struck with amazement to see the ocean seemed moving, full of resonance produced by a multitude of dashing waves rolling to and fro."
6-5-1,"That famous army, well-protected by Neela, was kept stationed nicely at the northernshore of the ocean."
6-5-2,"Both Maina and Dvivida the distinguished monkeys there moved in all directionsthrough that army, for the purpose of vigilance."
6-5-3,"After the army was settled at the sea-shore, Rama spoke to Lakshmana who was by hisside (as follows):"
6-5-4,"It is so said that sorrow gets vanished at the passing of time. But my agony of notseeing my beloved is getting increased every day."
6-5-5,"There is no anguish for me that my beloved is at a distance, nor that she was takenaway. Her age is indeed passing away. Only about this, I am repenting."
6-5-6,"Oh, wind! Flow from the side of my beloved. Touch her and touch me too. It isthrough you that I get a contact of her limbs. It is through moon that I get a contact of hereyes."
6-5-7,"That darling being carried away; might have cried Oh, Lord!"" Seeking for help.That thought is like poison gulped by me, hovering in my stomach and scorching my limbs."""
6-5-8,"My body is scorching night and day, by the fire of passion, holding fuel of myseparation from her and my thoughts of her flaring into shimmering flames."
6-5-9,"Oh, Lakshmana! Diving deep into the sea without you, I shall fall asleep. Thisflaming passion will not thus scorch me, lying down in water."
6-5-10,"It is enough for me, who is passionate, that Seetha with charming thighs and myselfare resting on one the same earth and on this fact I am able to survive."
6-5-11,"Even as a paddy-field without water survives, by getting wet from a neighboringpaddy-field under water, I also survive since I am hearing her as surviving."
6-5-12,"When shall I behold Seetha with charming hips, having long lotus-like eyesflourishing as prosperity, by conquering the enemies?"
6-5-13,"When, gently raising her face looking like louts, with its beautiful teeth andlips, shall I drink as a sick man the sovereign drink of remedy?"
6-5-14,"When will those breasts which are delightful close, bulging and quivering, lookinglike palmary fruits, indeed press me?"
6-5-15,"She, with dark-cornered eyes, who has fallen into the midst of demons, is surelynot getting any defender, she resembling an orphan, though I am her support."
6-5-16,"How Seetha the daughter of King Janaka, my darling and Dasaratha's daughter-in-lawis sleeping among ogresses?"
6-5-17,"Seetha will come out, driving away (through my force) the unassailable demons, asdriving away black clouds by a digit of the moon, in autumn."
6-5-18,"Seetha, who by nature is slender, will undoubtedly become leaner further because ofher anguish, her abstinence from food and her adverse position of time and place."
6-5-19,"When shall I bring back Seetha, having lodged arrows in Ravana's chest and havingabandoned this mental agony?"
6-5-20,"When indeed Seetha the virtuous lady similar to the child of a celestial, with anexcited longing, will embrace my neck and release tears of joy?"
6-5-21,"When shall I thrillingly abandon this terrible anguish, born out of my separationfrom Seetha so soon, as we abandon a soiled clothing?"
6-5-22,"While that sagacious Rama was lamenting thus there, the sun, the weak-rayed due today-decline, approached the dusk."
6-5-23,"Lakshmana consoled Rama who was overwhelmed with anguish, duly recollecting thelotus-eyed Seetha. Thereafter, Rama worshipped the evening-twilight."
6-6-1,"Having seen the fearful and the terrible act in Lanka done by Hanuma, like Devendrathe powerful King of celestials, Ravana with his face descended a little with shame, spoke to thedemons as follows:"
6-6-2,"By him, who was only a monkey, the irresistible City of Lanka was entered into andwas over-powered. Seetha the daughter of Janaka was also discovered by him."
6-6-3,"The thousand-pillared building used as a sanctuary was assaulted by Hanuma. Our mostexcellent demons were killed. The entire City of Lanka was made turbid."
6-6-4,"May prosperity befall on you! What shall I do? What appropriate thing is to be donenext? Please speak that which is well-answering and that, if attempted becomes well-done."
6-6-5,"Oh, people of great strength! Wise-men say that victory is dependent on goodforethought. Verily for that reason, I desire a deliberation about Rama."
6-6-6,"There are three types of men in the world, namely the foremost the middle most andthe lowest. I am telling their inherent merits and defects."
6-6-7,"The wise call him as the foremost among men, who carries through the beginning ofany undertaking after consulting those who are wedded with welfare of others, or with ministers whoare efficient in conferring decisions or with friends having common interests or additionally withrelatives or who try to get a favour from Providence too."
6-6-8,"The wise men call that man as mediocre, who deliberates about an activitysolitarily, applies his mind on law and justice all by himself and performs works singly."
6-6-9,"He who does not determine the merits and demerits of an act clearly, havingrecourse to Providence and neglects his duty by simply telling �I shall do it', he is the lowestamong men."
6-6-10,"In which manner these men are categorized always as good, bad or mediocre, so alsothe resolution in thought is classified as good bad or mediocre."
6-6-11,"The wise say that resolution of thought is excellent, in which the thinkers, on aview perceived by scriptures, obtain consensus and are satisfied with it."
6-6-12,"Only after deliberating several kinds of opinions, that decision of a matterobtained finally by a consensus of the counselors, is called mediocre."
6-6-13,"That resolution is said to be worst in which several arguments are made, employingone or the other divergent opinions and in which there is no advantage even after a consensus."
6-6-14,"For that reason, you, having excellent intellect, arrive at a well-thought outrightful action. To me, this is earnestly to be done."
6-6-15,"Rama surrounded by thousands of courageous monkeys, is coming to the City of Lanka,for the purpose of besieging us."
6-6-16,"Rama, by his be-fitting strength, can certainly cross the ocean easily, with hisbrother along with his army and his companions."
6-6-17,"He may even get the ocean dried up. He may do any other thing by his valour. Theaforesaid act of enmity with monkeys having commenced in this way, advise me everything that isgood for the city and my army."
6-7-1,"Hearing the words of Ravana, those demons who were strong, stupid and without moral conduct, all raising up their joined palms and spoke to Ravana the king of demons, without knowing the strengths of their enemy&#39;s side (as follows):"
6-7-2,"Oh, king! Our army, equipped with iron bars, javelins, double-edged swords, darts and sharp-edged spears, is very great. Why are you getting worried?"
6-7-3,"After proceeding to Bhogavati city (the abode of Nagas in Patala one of the seven regions under the earth), the serpents there were defeated by you. Kubera (the bestower of riches) who resides on the peak of Mount Kailasa, surrounded by many yakshas (a class of demi-gods) surrendered to you after doing a great battle."
6-7-4,"Oh, Lord! By your rage, Kubera who was boasting himself for his friendship with Lord Shiva (the Supreme Lord) and said to be a guardian of the world possessing great strength, was defeated by you in battle."
6-7-5,"Throwing down a group of Yakshas, after causing a flutter among them and taking them in prison, this aerial car (Pushpak) was procured by you from Mount Kailasa."
6-7-6,"Oh, the best of ogres! By Maya, the lord of demons, Mandodari his daughter was given to you in marriage, due to fear from you and duly desiring your friendship."
6-7-7,"Oh, mighty armed! Madhu Kumbhinasa&#39;s (your sister&#39;s) husband, another ruler of demons, who was proud of his valour and who was difficult to be defeated, was taken into your subjugation, your having won a battle against him."
6-7-8,"Oh, mighty armed! After moving down to rasatala (the penultimate subterranean region), the you conquered serpent-demons Vasukim Takshaka, Saukha and Jati were conquered by you and captivated as your subjects."
6-7-9,"Oh, annihilator of enemies, Commander of demons and the Lord! You after performing a battle for a year by you mighty demons who were beyond destruction, who were valiant and who obtained boons (for immortality) were defeated using your own strength in combat. Several fascinating tricks also were learnt from them."
6-7-10,"Oh, illustrious king! Varuna&#39;s sons, valiant strong and who were followed by an army having four limbs (viz. elephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry) were defeated by you in a battle."
6-7-11,"Oh, king! After entering a great ocean in the shape of Yama&#39;s realm, with a huge alligator in the form of death&#39;s rod of punishment, adorned with silk-cotton trees (bristling with thorns to be used a weapons), turbulent with a huge wave in the shape of noose of Kala (Time Spirit), with serpents in the form of Yama&#39;s servants and difficult to be conquered on account of mighty Jvara (Spirit presiding over fevers), and churning the sea in the form of Yama&#39;s forces, a great victory was obtained and death warded off by you. All the people there were delighted to see your good battle."
6-7-12,"The earth was filled, like with big trees, with many warriors who were strong with a courage equal to that Devendra (Lord of celestials)."
6-7-13,"Oh, King! Rama was not equal to them in combat, by their valour excellence and energy. Those warriors, who were difficult to be overcome in battle, were overpowered and killed by you."
6-7-14,"Oh, emperor! Why exertion to you? You remain here. Oh, emperor! This Indrajit alone can destroy the monkeys."
6-7-15,"Oh, emperor! After performing an excellent sacrifice to propitiate Mahesvara (the great lord shiva), a boon very rare to be obtained in the world, was acquired by him."
6-7-16,"Approaching that huge ocean of army of celestials, whose fish are lanes and spheres, whose guts thrown asunder as duck-weeds, whose turtles are the elephants, whose frogs are the teeming horses, infested with alligators in the form of (eleven) Rudras (gods of destruction) and (twelve) Adityas (sons of Aditi), with huge serpents in the form of (forty nine) Maruts (wind gods) and (eight) Vasus, having chariots horses and elephants for its volume of waters and the sandy elephants for its volume of waters and the sandy banks its infantry, Devendra (Lord of celestials) was captured by him and was impelled to come to Lanka (as a detenu)."
6-7-17,"Oh, king! Having been released by the orders of your grand father Brahma, Devendra who killed demons called Shambara and Vrita and who was adored by all celestials, went back to heaven."
6-7-18,"Oh, emperor! You send that Indrajit alone, so that the army of monkeys together with Rama will be brought to an end."
6-7-19,"Oh, king! This unbefitting danger has come froma a man who is ordinary. It is not to be kept by you in mind, you will kill Rama."
6-8-1,"A valiant demon by name Prahasta, the commander-in-chief, appearing like a darkcloud, joined his palms in salutation and spoke these words."
6-8-2,"All gods, demons, gandharvas, devils, birds and serpents can be attacked by you inbattle. Why to talk about two human beings?"
6-8-3,"All of us, in good faith but with negligence, were cheated by Hanuma. That monkeycannot go alive, while I am alive."
6-8-4,"I shall make the entire earth extending upto the ocean, along with mountainsforests and woods, bereft of monkeys. You command me."
6-8-5,"Oh, Ravana! I shall arrange for your defence from that monkey. Not a little troublewill come to you on account of your guilt (abduction of Seetha)."
6-8-6,"A demon by name Durmukha, being seriously enraged, spoke to him as follows: ""Thishumiliation meted out to us by that monkey is indeed not to be tolerated."""
6-8-7,"This insult to the city of Lanka and the palaces together with attack by Sugreevaon the glorious Ravana are still outrageous."
6-8-8,"Proceeding at this moment alone, I shall destroy those monkeys, whether theyentered the ocean or the subterranean region or the sky."
6-8-9,"Thereafter the very strong Vajradamshtra, beset with great anger, took hold of aterrific iron club smeared with flesh and blood and spoke (as follows):"
6-8-10,"What work for us with that pitiable and miserable Hanuma, when Rama along withLakshmana and Sugreeva who are difficult to be conquered exist?"
6-8-11,"Now itself, with this iron club, killing Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva afterperturbing the army of monkeys, I shall come back."
6-8-12,"Oh, king! If you are willing, hear my words further. One who is skilled din astratagem alone will be without lassitude and can indeed defeat the enemies."
6-8-13,"O, king of demons! Thousands of demons able to change their form at will courageaousappalling terrifying to look at and firm (in their purpose) can wear human body approach Ramawithout embarrassment and all speak to Rama (as follows)."
6-8-14,"We have been despatched by Bharata, your younger brother. He is summoning hisforces and will surely come here soon."
6-8-15,"Carrying spikes, javelins and maces together with arrows and swords in hand, wewill quickly go there from here soon."
6-8-16,"Standing as groups in the sky and beating that army of monkeys with a mighty hailof stones and missiles, we should send them to the world of Death."
6-8-17,"If Rama and Lakshmana thus approach softly into our trap they will surely abandontheir lives as they are taken away by the trap."
6-8-18,"Thereafter Kumbhakarna's son, by name Nikumbha, strong and powerful, became veryangry and spoke (as follows) to Ravana, who made people cry."
6-8-19,"All of you stay along with the king. I alone will kill there, Rama along withLakshman, Sugreeva along with Hanuma and all the monkeys also."
6-8-20,"Then, a demon by name Vajrahanu who was resembling a mountain, becoming enraged andlicking the corners of his mouth with his tongue, spoke as follows:"
6-8-21,"You do your occupations freely redeemed of mental pain, play comfortably and drinkspirituous liquor without any worry. I alone will devour the entire army of monkeys."
6-8-22,"At this time I alone will kill Sugreeva along with Lakshmana Hanuma along withAngada and all monkeys."
6-9-1,"Then, Nikumbha, Rabhasa, the exceedingly strong Surya satru, Suptaghna, Yaj"
6-9-2,"Now itself, we shall kill Rama along with Lakshmana and Sugreeva as well as thepitiable Hanuma by whom Lanka was attacked."
6-9-3,"Vibhishana (Ravana's youngest half-brother) restraining all those who were made toseize weapons, were made to sit again by saluting them with joined palms and spoke as follows:"
6-9-4,"Dear brother! That act which cannot be accomplished by three well-known strategies(viz . conciliation, gift and sowing dissention) , is only then to be accomplished by exhibitingprowess, as stated by wise men."
6-9-5,"The gallantries performed according to the prescribed precept, after being tested,O dear brother, only succeed against those who are indifferent, who have been already attacked byan enemy or who stand struck down by fate."
6-9-6,"How do you wish to attack that famous Rama, who is always attentive, who has a willto conquer, who is established in strength, who has subdued his anger and who is difficult to beconquered."
6-9-7,"Who can conceive or even imagine in this world, that Hanuma's speed in crossing theformidable ocean, which is the lord of streams and rivers?"
6-9-8,"O, demons! The strength and the abilities of the enemies are difficult to bemeasured. They cannot be treated with contempt hastily by any means."
6-9-9,"What offence was done earlier to the king of demons by the illustrious Rama, whosewife that he bore away from Janasthana?"
6-9-10,"Khara, who has gone beyond limits, was of course killed by Rama in an encounter.Lives are certainly to be protected, according to one's own strength, by living beings."
6-9-11,"For this reason, a very great danger because of Seetha will occur to us. She, whowas brought here, is to be given away. What is the use in doing anything, with an animosity as anend?"
6-9-12,"It is not appropriate to make enmity uselessly with Rama, who is valiant and whofollows righteousness. Let Seetha be given away to him."
6-9-13,"Before the City of Lanka with its elephants, horses and many riches are shattered byarrows, let Seetha be given away to him."""
6-9-14,"Not so long as the huge army of monkeys which is very dangerous and unconquerableattacks our Lanka, let Seetha be given away."
6-9-15,"If the beloved wife of Rama is not given away of your own accord, the city of Lankawill indeed perish. All our valiant demons too will Perish."
6-9-16,"I am propitiating you because of my relationship. Act on my words. I am telling youbeneficial as well as truthful word. Let Seetha be given away to him."
6-9-17,"Before Rama the prince discharges for your destruction, very strong and unfailingarrows equal to the rays of autumnal sun and provided with new heads and shafts, let Seetha begiven away to Rama."
6-9-18,"Abandon soon your anger, which destroys happiness and piety. Resort torighteousness, which augments joy and fame. Become placid so that we may live with our sons andrelatives. Let Seetha be given away to Rama."

6-10-14,"O, annihilator of enemies! We are seeing inauspicious omens, since Seetha arrivedhere."
6-10-15,"Even if the sacrificial fire is fed with oblations while uttering a proper set ofMantras (Spiritual texts), the fire is not flaring up well, emitting sparks, its flames areenveloped in smoke and are coming forth, polluted with soot."

6-10-21,"At city-gates are heard loud cries of carnivorous animals gathered in groups, withthundering noise."

6-10-23,"O, emperor! If I am speaking this because of infatuation or greed, in that casealso, you ought not to find fault with me."
6-10-24,"These bad omens are being seen indeed by demons and lady-demons of the city and ofthe gynaeceum as well as all these people here."
6-10-25,"All your ministers have abstained to pass this counsel to you. Whatever is seen orheard, it is to be told certainly by me. Hence, you ought to do according to a justification ofthings for the occasion."
6-10-26,"Vibhishana, the half- bother spoke these beneficial words to Ravana, the best amongdemons in the midst of his half-brother's ministers."

6-12-5,"Your army, as strong as you are, has been positioned both outside and inside thecity. Pray do quickly, with an undistracted mind, whatever is preferable to you."""
6-12-6,"Hearing the words of Prahasta, who wished the welfare of the kingdom, king Ravana,with a desire to obtain happiness, spoke in the desire midst of his friends as follows:"
6-12-7,"When you are in difficult situations regarding virtue pleasure and wealth, you areable to have a correct notion of pleasant and unpleasant things, happiness and sorrow, gain anddetriment as well as advantages and disadvantages."""
6-12-8,"All of my works undertaken by you with an act of attention, were never invain."
6-12-9,"I will obtain maximum prosperity, while abiding with you, as Indra obtainsproperity while abiding with moon, planets, stars and celestials."
6-12-10,"I am intent on reminding all of you again. But I could not inform this matterearlier to Kumbhakarna because of his sleep."
6-12-11,"This most powerful Kumbhakarna, the chief among all the wielders of weapons, wasindeed sleeping for the last six months and now, he woke up."
6-12-12,"Seetha the beloved wife of Rama was brought from the forest of Dandaka, the placefrequented by demons."
6-12-13,"Seetha of languid pace, does not like to reach my bed. I do not imagine any otherwoman similar to Seetha existing in the three worlds."""
6-12-14,"She has a slim waist, well-developed hips, and a face similar to an autumnal moon.Looking like an idol of gold and being placid She appears like an illusory image created byMaya."
6-12-15,"Seeing Her feet with rose-coloured soles, smooth and evenly resting on ground withthe rosy soles, my lust is kindled."
6-12-16,"Seeing her countenance similar to the flame of a sacrificial fire and looking likethe radiance of the sun, with her prominent nose and the pretty clear and handsome eyes, I becameunrestrained, having submitted to the will of my passion."
6-12-17,"I have been polluted by lust and equally by anger and pleasure thus making me paleand I have been ever since in grief and anguish."
6-12-18,"Looking forward Rama, her husband, that longish large eyed Seetha, requested me togive time for one year. I accepted the auspicious words of the charmingly eyed Seetha. I am weariedof this lust, like a horse galloping along a path continuously."
6-12-19,"How the monkeys or even Rama and Lakshmana can cross the unassailable ocean,completely infested as it was with sea-animals?"""
6-12-20,"on the other hand, a huge destruction was done to us, by a single monkey. Theconsequences of their acts are unpredictable. Tell me what is there in your mind, according to yourown understanding."
6-12-21,"We have no fear with human beings. Even so, the matter can be discussed. Earlier,together with you, I conquered the celestials in a battle between the celestials and demons. Youalso conquered them. Knowing the whereabouts of Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana together with Sugreevaand other monkeys reached the other shore of the ocean."
6-12-22,"Let a consultation be held by you and a judicious line of course suggested, so thatSeetha may not have to be handed -over to them back and Rama and Lakshmana may be killed."
6-12-23,"I do not see any other's capability to cross the ocean even so with the monkeys.Victory is surely mine."
6-12-24,"Hearing the lamentation of Ravana who was captivated by lust, Kumbhakarana becameangry and spoke the following words:"
6-12-25,"You should have contemplated thoroughly that very moment when Seetha was broughthere forcibly only after a single impulsive thought from the hermitage of Rama, who was accompaniedby Lakshmana, even like the river Yamuna fills the depression at its source the moment it descendson earth."
6-12-26,"O, emperor! If all this act of consultation with us was done at the beginning ofthis action itself (of bringing Seetha here), it would have been worthy of you."
6-12-27,"O, Ravana! A king who performs king's functions with a mind duly ascertained byjustice, will not repent thereafter."
6-12-28,"Actions done pervertedly without use of any stratagem get spoiled, even asoblations not intent on devotion got spoiled."
6-12-29,"He who is not aware of prudence and imprudence, wants to do actions which are to bedone before at a later stage and actions which are to be done later at a stage before."
6-12-30,"Seeing superior strength in a hasteful enemy, some look for his weak point, even asswans seek the cleavage in the Kraunca mountain."
6-12-31,"This great act was undertaken by you without proper thinking. By good fortune, Ramadid not kill you even as the meat mixed with poison would kill the consumer."
6-12-32,"O, irreproachable brother! Therefore by killing your enemies, I shall neutralizethe dishonourable act undertaken by you in relation to your enemies."
6-12-33,"O, ranger of night! I shall destroy your enemies. I shall do battle with the twobrothers, even if they are Indra and the sun-god or the god of fire and the wind-god or Kubera (thegod of riches) and Varuna (the god of water)."
6-12-34,"Entering the combat with a mountain-sized body and fiery teeth, roaring the whileand attacking with an immense bludgeon, I shall strike terror in Indra himself!"
6-12-35,"Even before Rama strikes me once more with a second arrow, I shall drink his blood.Cheer up freely."
6-12-36,"I shall try to fetch victory, which brings pleasure to you, by the killing of Rama.By exterminating Rama along with Lakshmana, I shall devour all the leaders of monkey-troops."
6-12-37,"Enjoy yourself freely. Drink excellent of wines to the extent of your desirewithout any anxiety. Rama, having been dispatched by me to the abode of death, Seetha will be atyour disposal forever."
6-13-1,"Perceiving Ravana enraged, a very strong demon named Mahaparsva thought for a whileand with joined palms, spoke as follows:"
6-13-2,"That man indeed is a fool, who after reaching a forest inhabited by wild beasts andvicious elephants and having duly found honey, does not drink it."
6-13-3,"O,annihilator of enemies! Who is a lord to you, who are a lord of all? Setting yourfoot upon the heads of your enemies, take pleasure with Sita."
6-13-4,"O, ruler endowed with a mighty prowess! Act in the mode of a cock, forcibly againsther. Enjoy that Sita, by charging on her again and again and revel with her."
6-13-5,"What fear will be there to you, after fulfilling your lust? All that comes or yetto come will be prevented (by us)."
6-13-6,"Kumbhakarna and Indrajit of great might together with us are capable of keeping offeven Devendra (god of celestials), wielding the weapon of a thunderbolt."
6-13-7,"Overstepping the methods of giving away gifts or conciliation or even showingdissention being followed by right men, I like accomplishment of actions through hostilemeans."
6-13-8,"O, ruler endowed with great might! We shall make all your enemies reaching here tosurrender, by the power of our weapons. There is no doubt about it."
6-13-9,"Appreciating the words spoken thus by Mahaparsva, King Ravana spoke the followingwords:"
6-13-10,"O, Mahaparsva! Know a little secret about me. I shall tell you an incident, whichoccurred to me long ago."
6-13-11,"Once I saw a celestial nymph, Punjikasthala(by name) flashing like a flame,concealing herself in the sky and proceeding towards the abode of Brahma."
6-13-12,"She was made unclothed by me and was enjoyed forcibly. Thereafter, appearing like acrumpled lotus, she went to the abode of Brahma."
6-13-13,"I think that the matter was made known to the high soled Brahama and then theenraged Brahma spoke to me the following words:"
6-13-14,"From today onwards, if you revel with any other woman forcibly, your head thenundoubtedly will break asunder into a hundred pieces."
6-13-15,"Fearing the curse given in this manner by Brahama, I am not violently making Sitathe daughter of Videha, to mount on my beautiful bed forcibly."
6-13-16,"My swiftness is like that of an ocean. My movement is like that of a wind. Ramadoes not know this and hence he is indeed having an encounter with me."
6-13-17,"If not otherwise, who wants to arouse me (for a combat) as one would awaken a lionasleep, sitting at a place in a mountain cave or arouse into activity an enraged Death?"
6-13-18,"Rama did not see the arrows, looking like two tongued serpents, coming forth fromme. That is why he is marching against me for a battle"
6-13-19,"I shall blaze up Rama swiftly with my arrows in hundreds resembling thunder boltsdischarged from my bow, like tormenting an elephant with fire brands."
6-13-20,"Surrounded by great army, I shall take away that strength of Rama, as a rising sunat dawn takes away radiance of the stars."
6-13-21,"Even Devendra (lord of celestials) with thousand eyes or Varuna (king of theUniverse) can not conquer me in battle. Once upon a time, this city of Lanka ruled by Kubera (Lordof riches) was conquered by me with the power of my arms."
6-14-1,"Hearing the words of Ravana the king of demons and the growls of Kumbhakarna,Vibhishana spoke the following friendly and meaningful words to Ravana the foremost king ofogres:"
6-14-2,"By whom, O, king, has been wrapped around your neck, this great serpent of giganticbody called Sita, with heap of expended hoods as her bosom, having poison as her anxiety and withsharp fangs as her sweet smile and with five hoods as her five fingers."
6-14-3,"Even before the monkeys with their body size as mountain peaks, having their teethand nails as weapons, rush full upon the city of Lanka, give back Sita to Rama."
6-14-4,"Even before arrows resembling thunder bolts and with a speed equal to wind,dispatched by Rama, take away the heads of chiefs of demons, give back Sita to Rama."
6-14-5,"O, king! Either Kumbhakarna or Indrajit and either Mahaparsva or Mahodara andeither Nikumbha or Kumbha or even Atikaya cannot withstand Rama in battle."
6-14-6,"Even if you are protected by the sun god, or by Maruts (storm gods) nor even seatedin the lap of Indra or god of Death nor if you have penetrated into the regions of heaven or underthe earth you will not be spared by the arrows of Rama."
6-14-7,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Prahasta spoke as follows: ""We are not knowing offear at all. We do not have fear of either celestials or demons at any time."""
6-14-8,"We do not have fear from Yakshas (demi- gods) or Gandharvas (celestial musicians)or eminent Nagas (serpent demons) or from birds and reptiles on the field of battle. When such isthe case, how can we have fear from Rama, the son of a human king at any time in battle?"
6-14-9,"Vibhishana who desired the welfare of the king and who possessed a stable mind invirtue wealth and pleasure, after hearing the inimical words of Prahasta, spoke highly meaningfulwords as follows:"
6-14-10,"O, Prahasta! The series of actions king or Mahodara as also yourself andKumbhakarna propose to take against Rama are impossible of being accomplished, any more than goingto heaven by wicked minded persons."
6-14-11,"How is it possible by me or by you or by all the demons to kill Rama, who is expertin all matters, any more than a person without a bark to cross a great ocean."
6-14-12,"Even the celestials would feel bewildered when placed in front of the king Rama whogives priority to righteousness, is a great car warrior, was born in the dynasty of Ikshvaku and iscapable of accomplishing his objects."
6-14-13,"O, Prahasta! The sharp arrows discharged by Rama, which are furnished with heron'sfeathers and are dangerous to be approached, have not yet penetrated, duly piercing, your body.That is why, you indulge in a boastful talk."
6-14-14,"The sharp and fatal arrows, discharged by Rama with the speed of a thunderbolt,have not yet penetrated, duly splitting your body. That is why; you are indulged in a boastfultalk."
6-14-15,"Ravana or Triseersha, with great strength or Nikumbha the son of Kumbhakarna orIndrajit or yourself are not capable to withstand Rama, who is equal in strength to Indra, inbattle."
6-14-16,"Even Devantaka or Narantaka or Atikaya or Atiratha of gigantic proportions, orAkampana who is mighty as an ocean are not capable to withstand against Rama in battle."
6-14-17,"This king who is overcome by evil addictions, * is rude in nature and actsinconsiderately. Such a king is being surrounded as a caucus by you who are his companions takingthe form of his enemies for the ultimate destruction of demons."
6-14-18,"You lift up and release this king, who has been wrapped forcibly by a terrific andexceedingly strong snake of boundless proportions having thousand hoods and make him completelyfree."
6-14-19,"All the well-wishers who are getting their desires fulfilled by the king, shouldcome together and protect the king by coercion even by pulling his hair if necessary as one who istaken ossession of by evil spirits with terrific strength, is protected by one's kith and kin."
6-14-20,"This Ravana, for his part who is going to be enveloped forcibly by an ocean in theshape of Rama - which is full of excellent water (who possesses excellent moral character) and whois about to fall into the mouth of Patala (the nethermost subterranean region) in the shape ofRama, is fit to be rescued united by you."
6-14-21,"I am telling these right and wholesome words, as per my opinion, to this city andthe demons inhabiting in it as well as to the king and his well wishers: Let Sita be given back toRama."
6-14-22,"A counselor is he, who after knowing the strength of the enemies and that of hisown (master) and even so duly grasping with his intellect, the status quo, fall, or rise inmilitary power like-wise on both sides, renders advice which is appropriate to the interest of hisking."
6-15-1,"Carefully hearing the words of Vibhishana, whose intellect was equal to that ofBrihaspati (god Of wisdom and eloquence) the high spirited Indrajit, the chief of army of demonsspoke as follows:"
6-15-2,"O, youngest uncle! Pray, what? Your words are meaningless and very muchfrightening. Even he who is not born in this race would neither speak such words nor do such athing (as you suggest)."
6-15-3,"In our race, this Vibhishana the youngest uncle is the only individual lacking instrength, heroism, prowess, courage, valor and vital powers W.w m."
6-15-4,"What after all are those princes who are mere human beings? They can be killed evenby one very ordinary demon among us. O, coward! Why are you frightening us? "
6-15-5,"At one time, the competent Devendra, the lord of three worlds, was indeed tosseddown on the floor by me. All the flocks of celestials were cast into fear and all of them fled todifferent quarters."
6-15-6,"Airavata (Indra`s elephant), which was making noise discordantly, was hurled downby me on the floor. I forcibly extracted its teeth and frightened the entire flock ofcelestials."
6-15-7,"How can I, with great valor, who suppressed the arrogance of even the celestialsand who made the lives of even excellent of the demons miserable, not capable of conquering the twoprinces who are ordinary human beings?"
6-15-8,"Hearing those words of Indrajit, who was equal to Indra (god of celestials),dangerous to be approached, and possessing great vital power, Vibhishana the excellent one amongbearers of weapons spoke then the following highly meaningful words:"
6-15-9,"O, child! There is no stability of thought in you. Being a boy, you are stillimmature in mind. That is why, many a meaningless word was prattled by you too, for only yourself-destruction."
6-15-10,"In the guise of a son, O, Indrajit, you are an enemy of Ravana putting on the maskof a well wisher in that even hearing (from me) of his destruction at the hands of Rama, you areblindly agreeing with him."
6-15-11,"You surely are fit to be killed. Nay, he too is fit to be killed, who brought you,a reckless boy here today and ushered you foolishly in the proximity of counselors."
6-15-12,"O, Indrajit! You are a stupid, irresolute, without humility, rude natured; unwise;evil person, inexperienced and highly evil minded. You are speaking in this manner because you arean immature boy."
6-15-13,"Who can endure the arrows, discharged by Rama in battle right in front of theenemy, which resemble Brahma's (creator's) staff in glory, which present a form similar to that ofGod of Death and are equal to the Yama's staff?"
6-15-14," O, king! Offering riches, precious stones, good jewellery, excellent clothes,bright colored gems and the god-like Sita to Rama, let us live here, free from anguish."
6-16-1,"Ravana, goaded by death, spoke the following harsh words to Vibhishana, who was verystable and who had spoken wholesome words:"
6-16-2,"One can stay together with an enemy or even with a furious snake, but one cannotstay together with an adversary yet avowing himself as a friend"
6-16-3,"O, demon! I know the conduct of kinsmen in all the worlds. These kinsmen always arerejoiced at the calamities of their kinsmen"
6-16-4,"O, demon! The kinsmen indeed insult and even humiliate their kinsman, who is aneffective leader, a person of education and right conduct and a valiant man."
6-16-5,"The horrible kinsmen with their concealed thoughts and treacherous minds, terrificones as they are, always rejoice each other in adversities."
6-16-6,"Previously in a forest called Padmavana, some maxims were spoken by elephants,which saw men with nooses in hand. Hear and I shall tell them."
6-16-7,"For us, fire or weapons or nooses are not begetting fear. The terrific kinsmen,incited by selfishness are begetting fear to us."
6-16-8,"These kinsmen will inform the strategy to our enemies to seize us. There is nodoubt about this. Out of all fears, the fear of kinsmen is very much troublesome for us. It is awell known thing."
6-16-9,"There is wealth in cows. There is fear for kinsmen. There is fickleness in women.There is austerity in Brahmins."
6-16-10,"O, gentleman! Hence, it is not of liking to you that the people are venerating me,that I obtained riches and that I am sitting tight in the heads of enemies."
6-16-11,"As drops of water fallen on lotus leaves do not get clung to those leaves, so alsoa friendship does not cling to vulgar ones."
6-16-12,"As rainy clouds in autumn, even though thundering, cannot get the earth saturatedwith water, so also friendship does not have tenderness of heart in vulgar people."
6-16-13,"As a honey bee, even though getting nectar from a flower, does not stick on to thatflower due to its eager desire for more, you also belong to that category as friendship does notstick on to vulgar people."
6-16-14,"As even though trying to drink nectar from a flower of grass, a honey bee cannotget it, so also friendship cannot be extracted from vulgar persons."
6-16-15,"How an elephant abuses its body by helping itself with dust after taking bathearlier with its trunk, friendship gets an abuse in vulgar persons in the same manner."
6-16-16,"O, demon, walking about by night! If any other person utters these words in thismanner, he will be ceasing to exit at this moment. O, destroyer of race! A curse upon you!"
6-16-17,"Hearing those harsh words from Ravana, Vibhishana who advocates justice, wielding amace in his hand, soared high into the sky, along with four other demons."
6-16-18,"Then, the illustrious Vibhishana who became angry also spoke these words to kingRavana, his brother after moving into the sky."
6-16-19,"O, king! You are a brother to me. You utter whatever you like. Elder brother islike a father. Even if he is not staying in a right path, he is to be respected. But I cannotforbear these harsh words from you."
6-16-20,"Those who have an ill composed mind and who get conceded to the occasion do notassimilate the words of prudence, spoken by a well wisher."
6-16-21,"O, king! Men who forever speak pleasing words are easy to be obtained. But one whospeaks of useful but unpleasing words as also the one who listens to them, are rare to beobtained"
6-16-22,"I could not ignore you, being destroyed by the noose of Yama (god of death); tiedaround you and which snatches away all beings, as none can ignore a burning house."
6-16-23,"I do not wish to see you, being killed by Rama with his sharp arrows, adorned withgold and each resembling like a blazing fire."
6-16-24,"Persons who are valiant, strong and skilled in weaponry, when time comes, sink down(ruin) as a dam constructed with sand sinks down."
6-16-25,"As an elder brother, bear the words spoken by me, who desire your welfare. Guardthis city and yourself along with demons, by all means. Let all be well with you. I am departing.Be a happy person without me."
6-16-26,"O, Ravana the ranger of the night! My words are not relishing to you, who are beingrestrained by me duly desiring your welfare. Persons whose duration of life is to end, do notaccept the salutary words spoken by their well wishers"
6-17-1,"Having spoken the aforesaid harsh words to Ravana, Vibhishana arrived almostimmediately to the place where Rama was together with Lakshmana."
6-17-2,"Those leaders of monkeys standing on the ground saw Vibhishana, resembling the peakof Mount Meru and shining like a thunderbolt in the sky."
6-17-3,"His four companions of terrific prowess were also there with him. They were wearingweapons and armour and were adorned with excellent ornaments."
6-17-4,"Vibhishana also resembled a mass of cloud, the equal of the God who wields thethunderbolt. He was holding excellent weapons and was adorned with wonderful jewels."
6-17-5,"Sugriva the valiant of monkeys, who was difficult to be overpowered, having seenVibhishana, the fifth one along with four others, became thoughtful along with monkeys."
6-17-6,"Having thought for a moment, Sugriva spoke these sterling words to all those monkeysand to Hanuman in particular."
6-17-7,"See this demon possessing all types of weapons, coming along with four demons.There is no doubt that he is coming to kill us."
6-17-8,"Hearing Sugriva's words, all those excellent monkeys lifted trees and mountains andspoke as follows:"
6-17-9,"Do you swiftly order us to slay these wicked doers, O, king? Let us strike thesefools down so that they drop to the ground!"
6-17-10,"While the monkeys were speaking thus among one another, Vibhishana had reached thenorthern shore and indeed coolly halted there."
6-17-11,"That great and highly intelligent Vibhishana, halting in the sky itself, saw Sugrivaand those monkeys and spoke to them in a loud voice (as follows):"
6-17-12,"There is a demon called Ravana, the king of demons, having a bad conduct. I am hisyounger brother, known as Vibhishana."
6-17-13,"It is Ravana who, having killed a bird Jatayu, took away Sita from Janasthana.Thatunfortunate lady is held captive against her will and she is now amidst the female titans who guardher jealously"
6-17-14,"I persuaded Ravana again and again by my diverse words and arguments to restoreSita smoothly to Rama."
6-17-15,"That Ravana, impelled by fate, did not receive my sage advice, as a pervertedperson does not accept his prescribed medicine"
6-17-16,"Reviled by him and humiliated as a slave, I, leaving my sons and my wife, have cometo take refuge with Rama."
6-17-17,"Inform immediately to high soled Rama, the protector of all the worlds, that I,Vibhishana, have come here."
6-17-18,"The swift-paced Sugriva, having heard the words of Vibhishana, spoke more hurriedlyto Rama, in front of Lakshmana as follows:"
6-17-19,"Belonging to the enemy force, here is an adversary taking us unawares, whounexpectedly has come here to slay us at the first opportunity like an owl destroying crows!"
6-17-20,"O, annihilator of enemies! You ought to be aware of the design, distribution,leading of the army and the secret service of the monkeys and also of your foes. May good come toyou!"
6-17-21,"These demons can assume any form at will and can disappear. They are valiant anddeceitful. We can not trust them at any time."
6-17-22,"He may be a spy of Ravana the king of demons. He will succeed to become a memberamong us and create differences. There is no doubt."
6-17-23,"Otherwise he , intelligent by himself, can get into possession of a weak point inus. Having first gained our confidence by craft, he may even at any time attack us."
6-17-24,"A contingent supplied by friends or an inhabitant of the woods (like our selves),or furnished by hereditary warriors or paid servants - all these contingents can be accepted butnot that furnished by an enemy."
6-17-25,"O, Lord! He is indeed a demon by nature and a brother of an enemy who came directlyfrom an adversary. How can we keep trust in him?"
6-17-26,"The younger brother of the famous Ravana, called Vibhishana along with four otherdemons approached you for refuge."""
6-17-27,"O, the excellent one among men knowing what is right! Know that Ravana is sendingVibhishana. I opine that Vibhishana is fit for arrest."
6-17-28,"O, the faultless one! Being sent with a crooked intent, this demon came here toattack when you are going to repose faith in him, (remaining hidden by his witchcraft)."
6-17-29,"This Vibhishana is indeed the brother of cruel Ravana. Hence, let him along withhis ministers be killed, by imposing severe punishment on them."
6-17-30,"The chief of army Sugriva, who knew how to speak expressed thus hurriedly to Rama,who was skilled in oratory and thereafter entered into silence."
6-17-31,"Hearing those words of Sugriva, the exceedingly strong Rama addressed as follows tothe monkeys in front of Hanuman staying near by:"
6-17-32,"The very reasonable words uttered by Sugriva about Vibhishana were heard by youtoo."
6-17-33,"An efficient and intelligent person ever desirous of everlasting well being of hisfriends should properly advise them well in difficult matters. Hence, tell your opinion one byone"
6-17-34,"Thus asked by Rama, those monkeys free from lassitude, wishing to do good and out oftheir politeness, spoke their respective opinions to Rama as follows:"
6-17-35,"O, Rama! Nothing is unknown to you in the three worlds. You are consulting us witha friendly heart, as an honor to us."
6-17-36,"You are avowed to truth, a valiant man and a righteous man of firm fortitude. Youtake action only after proper investigation. You have good memory. You are committed in your heartto your friends."
6-17-37,"Hence, your counselors, who are rich in their minds and are moreover efficient, oneby one, will tell their opinion with reason."
6-17-38,"Having spoken thus by the monkeys, Angada the intelligent monkey told Rama toarrange for examination of Vibhishana before hand."""
6-17-39,"Vibhishana who came from an enemy is indeed to be doubted by all means. He is notto be made as a trust worthy person so soon."
6-17-40,"Deceitful persons move around, concealing their peculiar nature and attack at weakplaces. They will create a very great misfortune."
6-17-41,"One must take a decision, after ascertaining the pros and cons of it. One shouldtake up the action, if there is an advantage and reject it, if it is faulty."
6-17-42,"O, king! If there are great faults in him, let him be rejected undoubtedly. If werecognize many good qualities in him, let him be accepted."
6-17-43,"Thereafter Sharabha on his part spoke the following meaningful and decisive words:""O, tiger among men! Let a spy be sent to shadow him"""
6-17-44,"By sending out a spy and causing a suitable investigation by a keenly intellectualspy, he can then be accepted as per justice."
6-17-45,"Then, the discerning Jambavan on his part, perceiving the matter through hislearning derived from scriptures, advised the following fault-less and qualitative words:"
6-17-46,"This Vibhishana came from sinful Ravana who has contracted hostility with you andthat too at a wrong place and time. He is to be suspected by all means."
6-17-47,"Then Mainda, skilled in discriminating good and bad conduct in others observed thematter carefully and spoke in his perfect oratory in the following highly reasonable words:"
6-17-48,"O, king of kings! This Vibhishana is indeed the younger brother of that Ravana. Lethim be questioned slowly by sweet words"
6-17-49,"O, the best among men! Having read actually his mind whether he is dangerous ornot, you should act according to your feelings."
6-17-50,"Then the well educated Hanuman, the excellent among counselors; spoke the followingsmooth meaningful, sweet and brief words:"
6-17-51,"Even Brihaspati, while talking cannot excel you, who are possessing an exaltedintellect. You are powerful and the foremost man among those who are eloquent."
6-17-52,"O, king! O, Rama! I am talking neither for argument, nor for competition (withother counselors, nor for superiority, nor out of passion for debate but on account of importanceof this matter in hand."
6-17-53,"I am perceiving an error in what was advised by your counselors assigned to lookinto advantages and disadvantages, accruing from accepting Vibhishana. It is not possible for sucha judicious investigation into his character."
6-17-54,"Without entrusting any work, it is not possible to understand his ability. But atthe same time, it occurs to me as a mistake to entrust any work so soon to a stranger."
6-17-55,"What ever was told by your counselors that it was befitting to send spies toVibhishana, that action is not possible due to impracticality of the proposition."
6-17-56,"It has been said that Vibhishana came into a wrong place and time. In that matter,I have to express my thought. Listen to it."
6-17-57,"This place and time become rightly obtained in his mind , as he has thought thatyou are superior to Ravana and also found merits in you and demerits in Ravana."
6-17-58,"It is indeed appropriate for him to arrive at this place and time, by seeing theprowess in you and the wickedness in Ravana. It is worthy of his judgment."
6-17-59,"O, king! Whatever was told by your counselors that let Vibhishana be questioned byspies of unknown identity, my considered view is as follows:"
6-17-60,"A wise man being questioned suddenly would be apprehensive of that questioning. Inthose circumstances, an easily obtained friend becomes faithless upon facing a deceitfulquestioning."
6-17-61,"O, king! Without possessing a high skill of reading his diversified tones, it isnot possible rapidly to comprehend his intention."
6-17-62,"I am not seeing any bad intention at all in his talk. His face is also bright.Hence, I do not doubt him."
6-17-63,"A deceitful person does not approach so fearlessly and confidently. His expressiontoo is not bad. Hence, there is no doubt to me on him."
6-17-64,"It is not possible to hide expression of the face, even if it is concealed. Byforce, the internal intent of the persons certainly gets revealed."
6-17-65,"O, the eminently skillful man in work! An action endowed with proper place and timetransacts successfully, if it is performed quickly."
6-17-66,"Seeing your perseverance and the improper conduct of Ravana as well as hearingabout Vali having been killed and Sugriva anointed as king, he deliberately came here, with adesire to obtain the kingdom of demons. On consideration of this aspect alone, he is worthy ofacceptance by us."
6-17-67,"O, Rama the best among the wise! It has been told by me this according to myability about the sincerity of this demon. After hearing my words, you are indeed the final judgeof the issue."
6-18-1,"Thereafter the inviolable Rama who possesses sacred knowledge, after hearingHanuman's words, spoke with a clear understanding, the following opinion that was firm in hismind:"
6-18-2,"I also wish to tell my opinion about Vibhishana. I want it to be heard by you, whoare firmly established in our welfare."
6-18-3,"By any means, I do not desert anyone who arrives with a friendly appearance, evenif he has a defect. His acceptance is irreproachable in the eyes of good men"
6-18-4,"Then, Sugreeva the chief of monkeys closely analyzed and examined the aforesaidwords of Rama and thereafter spoke the following most auspicious words:"
6-18-5,"What matters if this ranger of night is very dangerous or other wise, if he candesert his own brother at a time of peril? Whom will he not betray subsequently?"
6-18-6,"Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Rama who was truly mighty looked round all of them ,smiled a little and spoke the following words to Lakshmana, of virtuous characteristics:"
6-18-7,"Without studying scriptures and without serving elders, it is not possible to speaksuch words as Sugreeva spoke."
6-18-8,"It appears to my mind that there is however something peculiar in thesecircumstances which are clearly to be seen in all lives of kings and even occurring in ordinarylife."
6-18-9,"It is told that persons of the same family and rulers belonging to adjoiningterritories become enemies and strike in times of adversities. For this reason, he came here."
6-18-10,"Even if belonging to the same family, persons who are virtuous do respect their ownwell wishers in that family. Generally among kings, even a virtuous person is apprehended."
6-18-11,"With regard to the draw back you told me in the matter of accepting a person comingfrom the side of an adversary, hear from me what the scriptures say."
6-18-12,"We do not belong to the same family. Further, Vibhishana the demon is desirous ofacquiring the kingdom. A few of the demons also may be rather learned ones. That is why, Vibhishanais acceptable."
6-18-13,"Kinsfolk do not live together in a fearless mode and in a delightful manner. Hence,they get a split among themselves. For this reason, a fear has come to him. This loud appeal isalso major cause. That is why, Vibhishana can be accepted."
6-18-14,"My dear one! Neither all brothers are like Bharata, nor all sons of a father likeme nor all friends are like you."
6-18-15,"Hearing Rama's words Sugreeva who was together with the highly wise Lakshmana stoodup saluting and spoke these words:"
6-18-16,"O, Rama the excellent among the tolerant! Realise that Ravana has sent Vibhishana,the demon. I think of him to be worthy of being taken as a captive."
6-18-17,"O, the mighty armed Rama! The faultless one! This demon is being sent to kill youwho are unsuspecting, or to kill Lakshmana or me in trust. He came here with a crooked mind. Hewith his counselors is fit to be imprisoned. Is not Vibhishana the brother of cruel Ravana?"
6-18-18,"Speaking thus to Rama, the best of Raghu dynasty, Sugreeva who knew the mode ofexpression, thereafter kept silent."
6-18-19,"Hearing those words of Sugreeva, Rama pondered over the words and thereafter spokemore auspicious words to Sugreeva as follows:"
6-18-20,"What does it matter whether that demon is very bad or not bad? He is incapable ofdoing even a little harm to me."
6-18-21,"O, Sugreeva, Lord of monkey-troops! If I wish, I can kill those devilish beings,demons, supernatural beings and ogres living on earth with just a tip of my finger"
6-18-22,"It is narrated how by a dove, its enemy ( a fowler) when it came for a refuge, wasreceived according to rules of hospitality and was invited for a feast with its own flesh."
6-18-23,"O, the excellent of monkeys! The aforesaid dove indeed accepted as a guest, thefowler as he came, although he killed its wife .How much more a man like me has to do?"
6-18-24,"Hear the verses inculcating virtue so long ago, by Kandu, the son of a sage calledKanva, a great sage and a speaker of truth."
6-18-25,"O, king the terminator of enemies! Even an enemy, who formed a cup with hishollowed hands, a miserable person, a person who is begging and who is seeking a refuge should notbe killed with the aim of not being cruel."
6-18-26,"An enemy who comes for protection against others, even if the aforesaid enemy isoppressed or arrogant, is to be protected by one who has a disciplined mind, even by abandoningone's life."
6-18-27,"If he does not protect rightly through his strength, by fear or by ignorance or bydesire, it is a sin to be reproached by the world."
6-18-28,"If having not been protected, a refugee dies before the eyes of a man who is ableto protect him, the former takes along all his moral merit and goes."
6-18-29,"In not protecting thus the persons who take refuge, there is a great blemishinvolved in it. It does not bestow heaven. It destroys reputation. It devastates strength andvalor"
6-18-30,"I will follow the excellent words of Kandu. It becomes a very righteous thing,gives reputation, leads to heaven and the rewards appear consequently."
6-18-31,"He who seeks refuge in me just once, telling me that �I am yours', I shall give himassurance of safety against all types of beings. This is my solemn pledge"
6-18-32,"O, Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys! Let him either be Vibhishana or even Ravanahimself; I have given an assurance of safety to him. Bring him here."
6-18-33,"Hearing Rama' s words, Sugreeva the lord of monkeys, overwhelmed as he was withcordial friendship, replied to Rama as follows:"
6-18-34,"O, Rama, who knows righteousness, the crest jewel among lords of the world! Whatsurprise is there in thinking that you, duly endowed with true essence of life and established in aright path, speak these venerable words?"
6-18-35,"My inmost spirit also feels Vibhishana to be a genuine person, he being wellexamined from all angles, by act of inference and by his appearance."
6-18-36,"O, Rama! Hence, let the highly wise Vibhishana be equal among us soon together. Lethim get our friendship too"
6-18-37,"Hearing those words of Sugreeva, Rama the king of men, as acknowledged by Sugreeva,held meeting with Vibhishana, as Indra the lord of celestials once met Garuda the king ofbirds."

6-19-1,"While the assurance of protection having been given to Rama, the highly sagaciousVibhishana the brother of Ravana bent down and glanced towards the earth."
6-19-2,"The virtuous Vibhishana descended joyously from the sky to the ground along with hisfaithful companions and alighted in the vicinity of Rama."
6-19-3,"Thereafter, Vibhishana along with the four demons fell prostrate and spoke to Ramathe following words which were equitable suitable and delightful."
6-19-4,"I am the younger brother of Ravana and was humiliated by him. I sought refuge inyou, who are the refuge for all the beings."
6-19-5,"Abandoning Lanka, friends and possessions, I place my kingdom, life and happinessat your disposal."
6-19-6,"Hearing those words of Vibhishana, Rama in a soothing tone and with a refreshinglook in his eyes, spoke these words: ""Tell me really the strengths and weaknesses of thedemons."""
6-19-7,"Thus asked then by Rama who was unwearied in action, Vibhishana started tellingabout the detailed strength of Ravana."
6-19-8,"O, prince! Because of a special boon given by Brahma (lord of creation), Ravana cannot be killed by all beings, Gandharvas (celestial musicians), serpents, and birds."
6-19-9,"Kumbhakarna, my elder brother born after Ravana, who is valiant and highly powerful,has enough strength to fight against Indra (Lord of celestials) in battle."
6-19-10,"O, Rama! You might have heard about Prahasta, his chief of army. He defeatedManibhadra in a battle on the mountain of Kailasa."
6-19-11,"When furnished with gloves made of the skin of Iguana (to prevent injury from thebowstring) and when clad in armor that no arrow can pierce, that Indrajit (son of Ravana) standingin battle wielding a bow, becomes invisible."
6-19-12,"O, Rama! The glorious Indrajit, having propitiated the God of Fire, strikes hisenemy while remaining invisible in the battle field with a huge battle array (on both sides)"
6-19-13,"Mahodara and Mahaparsva along with a demon called Akampana who are equal to theguardians of the world in battle - they are the commanders of his army."
6-19-14,"In the city of Lanka, are residing ten thousand crore demons, who can assume anyform at will and who consume flesh and blood as their staple food"
6-19-15,"King Ravana along with those demons made war against the guardians of the earth.Those guardians of the earth along with the celestials were defeated by the wicked Ravana."
6-19-16,"Hearing the aforesaid words of Vibhishana, Rama scrutinized them all attentively andspoke the following words:"
6-19-17,"O, Vibhishana! I indeed know those feats standing to the credit of Ravana, whichwere told by you, as true."
6-19-18,"After killing Ravana along with Prahasta and his son (Indrajit), I will make youthe king. Hear this truth from me."
6-19-19,"Ravana may well plunge into Rasaatala (the penultimate subterranean region) or evenPaataala (the nethermost subterranean region) or seek the presence of Brahma and he will not beleft alive by me."
6-19-20,"I will not enter Ayodhya without killing Ravana together with his sons, companionsand relatives in battle. I take oath on my three brothers."
6-19-21,"Hearing the words of that Rama, who was unwearied in action, the right mindedVibhishana saluted him by bowing his head and started telling as follows:"
6-19-22,"I will extend my help in killing the demons and in attacking the city of Lanka.According to my strength, I will also penetrate into the army of the adversary to fight."
6-19-23,"Rama on his part, duly delighted, embraced Vibhishana who was speaking as aforesaidand spoke to Lakshmana as follows: ""Bring some water from the ocean."""
6-19-24,"O, Lakshmana who bestows honor on others! Quickly consecrate as a king of demonsthis greatly intelligent Vibhishana with that water, so that I am pleased."
6-19-25,"Hearing Rama's words, Lakshmana consecrated Vibhishana as a king, as per the royalinstructions, amidst the leaders of monkeys."
6-19-26,"Perceiving that instant graciousness in Rama, the monkeys cried, proclaiming""excellent, excellent"" about the high soled Rama."
6-19-27,"Hanuman and Sugreeva asked Vibhishana as follows: "" How can we cross theimperturbable ocean, the habitation of Varuna, the god of water by all of us along with our army ofmonkeys possessing a great splendor?"""
6-19-28,"In what manner shall we along with the army swiftly cross the sea, the lord ofstreams and rivers, and arrive at that strategy?"
6-19-29,"Hearing their words, the right minded Vibhishana replied as follows: ""It is apt ifprince Rama seeks ocean as his refuge"""
6-19-30,"This immeasurable great ocean was excavated by Sagara*. Hence, this great oceanwill be inclined to do the act for Rama, his kinsman."
6-19-31,"Hearing the aforesaid words of the learned demon Vibhishana, Sugreeva came to theplace where Rama and Lakshmana were there."
6-19-32,"The long necked Sugreeva then started to tell the auspicious words of Vibhishana,advising Rama to approach the ocean (to allow him a passage)."
6-19-33,"That advice found favor with Rama who by nature is of pious attitude. Then thathighly illustrious Rama replied to Sugreeva, the ruler of monkeys who was skillful in action andwho was accompanied by Lakshmana. Full of respect for Vibhishana's words, he told him as also hisbrother Lakshmana smilingly as follows:"
6-19-34,"O, Lakshmana! This idea of Vibhishana is agreeable to me. Sugreeva is a learnedperson. You are ever wise in your thoughts. Both of you decide on the matter and inform whicheveris agreeable to you."
6-19-35,"Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva and Lakshmana both, valiant as they were, spoke withproper courtesy, the following words: ."
6-19-36,"O, Rama the tiger among men! Why not Vibhishana's words, which are soothing at thistime of crisis be agreeable also to us?"
6-19-37,"Without constructing a bridge across this fiery ocean, which is an abode of LordVaruna, even the celestials and demons along with Indra cannot reach the city of Lanka."
6-19-38,"Let the valiant Vibhishana's words be followed suitably. It is enough that we havealready wasted our time. Let the ocean be commanded to yield a passage for the army to reach thecity being ruled by Ravana."
6-19-39,"Having been thus exhorted, Rama then sat on the shore of the ocean covered withblades of Kusha grass, as the God of Fire ascends the altar."
6-20-1,"Thereafter, an energetic demon named Shardula came and saw the army, commanded bySugriva, which was drawn up in a battle array."
6-20-2,"That demon, the spy of Ravana the evil natured king of ogres, coolly observed thatarmy from all sides, speedily returned to Lanka and spoke to their king as follows:"
6-20-3,"Boundless and immeasurable like another ocean, this multitude of monkeys and bearsis approaching Lanka.."
6-20-4,"These brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the sons of Dasaratha, the excellent and themost dignified men endowed with beauty have arrived in the cause of Sita and settled in a campafter reaching the sea shore ."
6-20-5,"O, monarch! Their army is employed around a radius of ten yojanas (eighty miles)onall sides. You have to ascertain this truth quickly"
6-20-6,"O, monarch! Your other spies also ought to ascertain the fact quickly. Under suchcircumstances, either conciliation or an act of giving away or sowing dissention (in the enemy'sranks) may be employed."
6-20-7,"Hearing Shardula's words Ravana the lord of demons was perturbed and immediatelydetermined his cause of action. Then he spoke the following words to a demon by name, Shuka theforemost among those who know their duty."
6-20-8,"Going quickly, speak fearlessly to king Sugriva on my behalf, according to mycommand, in an excellent and gentle voice, as follows:"
6-20-9,"O, great king! You are indeed born in a noble family, possessor of a great strengthand are a son of Riksharaja. No gain whatsoever or any harm will accrue to you (from this battle).O, lord of monkeys! Nevertheless, you are like a brother to me."""
6-20-10,"What does it matter to you, if I have embezzled the wife of a wise prince?(Therefore) return to Kishkindha"
6-20-11,"This Lanka cannot be reached by monkeys in any way. It cannot be acquired even bycelestials and Gandharvas (celestial musicians), why to talk about men and monkeys?"
6-20-12,"Then Shuka the demon heralded by Ravana turned himself into the form of a bird andquickly flew into the sky."
6-20-13,"Proceeding in the sky for a distance continuously over the ocean, Shuka then stoodup in the sky itself and spoke these words to Sugriva:"
6-20-14,"Shuka repeated all the words the wicked Ravana had told him to say to Sugriva. As hewas still speaking, the monkeys bounded into the air to reach him at that moment quickly to tearoff his wings and to smite him by their fists."
6-20-15,"The demon thus attacked was forcibly seized by all the monkeys and immediatelybrought down to the ground from the sky."
6-20-16,"Shuka being harassed by monkeys spoke the following words: ""O, Rama! Messengers arenot to be killed. Let your monkeys be restrained properly."""
6-20-17,"That messenger, who by abandoning the opinion of his king will speak about his ownopinion though he being a messenger and he who on the other hand speaks that which was not told tohim, that messenger is indeed fit to be killed."
6-20-18,"Hearing Shuka's complaining words, Rama spoke to the foremost of monkeys, who werebeating him as aforesaid, saying ""Do not kill him"""
6-20-19,"Perceiving no fear from monkeys, Shuka became light winged, virtually standing inthe sky and spoke again the following words."
6-20-20,"O, Sugriva, rich in courage and possessing great strength and valor! What am I totell Ravana, whose nature is to cause world to cry?"
6-20-21,"Hearing the aforesaid words, the mightily strong Sugriva the king of monkeys and theforemost among them, with a merciless mind then spoke to the blame less Shuka, Ravana's spy, asfollows:"
6-20-22,"O, Ravana, worthy of killing! You are not my companion. You are not worthy ofsympathy. You are not the person who helped me in any way. I do not like you, as you are Rama'senemy. Hence, You are worthy to be killed like Vali, along with your associates"
6-20-23,"O, the king of demons! I am killing you along with your sons, relatives and otherkinsfolk. Arriving with a great army, I will reduce the entire Lanka and all of you to ashes."
6-20-24,"O, stupid Ravana! You along with your younger brother will not be left unkilled byRama, even if you are protected by all including Indra (the lord of celestials) or even if you havedisappeared (by virtue of conjuring trick) or obtained, the solar orbit or entered the nethermostsubterranean region or even if approached the lotus feet of Shiva (the lord of Kailasamountain)"
6-20-25,"I do not see any protector to you as such in the three worlds, nor do I see anydevilish being or a demon or a Gandharva (celestial musician) or an ogre coming forward to protectyou."
6-20-26,"You killed Jatayu, the king of vultures and who was senior to you in old age. Whythe wide-eyed Sita was not taken away in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana? Having made hercaptive, you do not recognize her for what she is."
6-20-27,"You are unaware how strong, high soled and irresistible even to celestials, is thisRama the excellent man of Raghu dynasty, who shall deprive you of your life."
6-20-28,"Thereafter, Angada the son of Vali and the foremost of the monkeys spoke as follows:""O, Sugriva the highly intelligent! He is not an ambassador. He appears to me as a spy."""
6-20-29,"All our army has been indeed evaluated by him, standing here. Let him be madecaptive. Let him not return to Lanka. This indeed finds favor with me."
6-20-30,"Commanded then by the king Sugriva, the monkeys jumped up, seized and bound him, whowithout defence, wailed loudly."
6-20-31,"Harassed by those monkeys there, Shuka on his part cried loudly towards Rama, thehigh soled son of Dasaratha as follows:"
6-20-32,"My wings are being pulled out forcibly. My eyes are being pierced. If I die, allthe sins incurred by me between my birth and my death would fall to your share."
6-20-33,"Hearing that lamentation of Shuka, Rama did not allow his killing by the monkeys.Rama ordered monkeys to release him, as he came as an ambassador."
6-21-1,"Thereafter Rama, the annihilator of enemies, spreading sacred grass on the seashore, making a respectful salutation (by joining his palms) to the great ocean with his faceturned eastward, lied down with his arm, resembling the body of a snake , as his pillow."
6-21-2,"His arm formerly adorned with armlets of gems and gold and the most excellent jewelsof pearls, was touched more than once, by excellent women ( Kausalya and other mothers or by royalmaids)."
6-21-3,"Formerly, his arm used to be tended with sandalwood and aloe and with saffron pastesand made beautiful like the splendor of a rising sun."
6-21-4,"In the past, the aforesaid arm was graced by the head of Seetha on the couch. Itresembled the body of Takshaka. (A snake) supported on the water of the Ganga."
6-21-5,"The aforesaid arm resembled a yoke. It enhanced the grief of his enemies in battle.It was delightful to his friends. It is now placed at the shore of the sea."
6-21-6,"The aforesaid arm whose skin had been hardened by the strokes of the bow string, offthe left arm resembling a great mace and that mighty right arm that bestowed thousands of cows incharity was used as a pillow. Rama, the competent man and the mighty armed said: "" Either crossingof the ocean or a death should occur to me today"". Making that resolve he laid down by the ocean,restraining his speech and with a pious disposition according to tradition."
6-21-7,"Following the scriptural injunction, that Rama who was devoted to his sacred vow,while sleeping on the ground spread with Kusha grass, spent a time of three nights there."
6-21-8,"Remaining there for three nights, Rama who was skilled in policy and fond of piety,waited upon the ocean, the lord of rivers."
6-21-9,"Though honored according to his worth by the self subdued Rama, the careless oceandid not appear in his personal form to Rama."
6-21-10,"Rama becoming angry with the ocean, having the outer corners of his eyes turned red,spoke those words to Lakshmana, having auspicious marks, who was in his vicinity:"
6-21-11,"O, what arrogance of the ocean, who does not appear himself personally before me!Indeed calmness, forbearance kind spoken ness and straight -forwardness- these qualities of noblemen give weak results, when directed towards those having no virtues."
6-21-12,"This world honors that man, who boasts himself, is corrupt and shameless, runsabout in all directions advertising himself and commits every kind of excess"
6-21-13,"O, Lakshmana! In this world, it is not possible to obtain fame, glory or victory atthe end of a battle, by conciliation"
6-21-14,"O, Lakshmana! Behold now this ocean, having its water made suffocated soon with itscrocodiles floated on all sides and broken asunder by my arrows."
6-21-15,"See here, O, Lakshmana, the coils of water snakes, the huge bodies of alligatorsand the trunks of sea elephants being shattered by me."
6-21-16,"I will make the ocean with its multitude of conches, oyster shells, fishes andcrocodiles, dry up now in this great battle"
6-21-17,"This ocean is considering me as an incapable man endowed as I am with forbearance.It is a great mistake to show forbearance to such an individual."
6-21-18,"The Ocean is not appearing himself before me on kind words. O, Lakshmana! Bring thebow and the serpentine arrows. I shall dry up this ocean, so that our monkeys can cross it byfeet."
6-21-19,"Being provoked now, I will shake this ocean, even if it is unshakable. I will forcethe ocean, which is demarcated by banks and agitated with thousands of waves, bereft of a boundary,by my arrows. I will agitate the great ocean, thronged with great demons."
6-21-20,"Speaking as aforesaid, Rama with his eyes made larger by anger and wielding a bowwith his hand, became dreadful to look at, as a blazing fire at the end of the world."
6-21-21,"Swaying his terrific bow and making the earth tremble by his violence Rama releasedthe arrow resembling a powerful thunderbolt of Indra. (god of celestials)."
6-21-22,"Those excellent arrows having a great speed and ablaze by their splendor, penetratedthe waters of the ocean, striking the water- snakes with terror."
6-21-23,"The great jerk of water with fishes and alligators of the ocean, together with theresonance of the wind became very much dreadful."
6-21-24,"Immediately that great ocean, became shaken by the cluster of huge waves envelopedby a multitude of conches in its rolling waves and a smoke came out."
6-21-25,"Sea-snakes having brilliant faces and glittering eyes and the very valiant demonsresiding in nethermost subterranean region of the sea, were perturbed."
6-21-26,"Thousands of waves, so large resembling Vindhya and Mandhara mountains, jumped upfrom the sea with its crocodiles and sea monsters."
6-21-27,"That ocean with its multitude of fluctuating waves, with its frightened serpents anddemons, with huge crocodiles coming out, became full of noise."
6-21-28,"Then Lakshmana rushed towards Rama who in a terrific velocity was stretching hisincomparable bow, with a penetrating sigh, crying: ""No further, no farther"" and took hold of thebow."
6-21-29,"O, honorable man! Even without the destruction of the ocean, the purpose of you thegreatest hero will be fulfilled. Men like you do not fall into the sway of anger. You see somedurable and noble alternative"
6-21-30,"Brahmana-sages and celestial sages, stationed in the interior of the sky cried in aloud voices, saying ""No farther, no farther"" and making a noise ""Ah,Oh,Alas!"""
6-22-1,"Then, Rama spoke these harsh words to the ocean: ""O, ocean! I will make you dry upnow along with your nethermost subterranean region."""
6-22-2,"O, Ocean! A vast stretch of sand will appear, when your water gets consumed by myarrows; when you get dried up and the creatures inhabiting you get destroyed by me."
6-22-3,"By a gush of arrows released by my bow, our monkeys can proceed to the other shoreeven by foot; O, ocean!"
6-22-4,"O, Sea the abode of demons! You are not able to recognize my valor or prowessthrough your intelligence .You will indeed get repentance at my hands."
6-22-5,"Fixing an arrow resembling the Rod of Brahma (the creator) charged with a missile(presided over by Brahama) to his excellent bow, the exceedingly powerful Rama stretched it towardsthe sea."
6-22-6,"While Rama was stretching that bow, both the heaven and earth suddenly seemed to besplit asunder. Mountains also were shaken."
6-22-7,"Darkness enveloped the world. All the quarters were obscured. Lakes and rivers weresoon agitated."
6-22-8,"The moon sun and the stars moved obliquely and though the sun's rays lighted thesky, it was enveloped by darkness and shined with a blaze of hundreds of meteors while thundersreverberated with an unparalleled sound in the sky."
6-22-9,"Series of celestial winds blew in their colossal form and the winds, then sweepingaway the clouds, tore up the trees again and again."
6-22-10,"The wind, shattering the mountain peaks, broke off the points of the rocks. Winds ofgreat velocity struck together in the sky and emitted flashes of radiance proceeding from lightningwith a great sound and then there were great thunders."
6-22-11,"The visible creatures cried out along with the thunders. The invisible beings toogave off a terrific noise. The creatures were overpowered, frightened, agitated, lied down and alsovery much anguished. They did not move due to fear."
6-22-12,"The great ocean with its waves and water, along with its living creatures includingsnakes and demons soon became possessed of a terrific velocity. Due to that speed and swelling ofwaters, the ocean crossed beyond the other shore to the extent of a Yojana (eight miles)."
6-22-13,"Rama born in Raghu dynasty and the annihilator of enemies, did not retreat beforethat ocean, which swelled and crossed its limits."
6-22-14,"Then, Sagara (the ocean god) himself rose from the middle of the ocean as the sunrises at dawn from the huge mountain of Meru."
6-22-15,"That ocean along with snakes of flaming jaws appeared with a hue of glossy emeraldadorned with gold."
6-22-16,"The valiant ocean, the lord of rivers, wearing a wreath of pearls, with his eyesresembling lotus leaves, bearing a beautiful garland made of all kinds of flowers on his head, withornaments of refined gold, adorned with excellent jewels made of pearls from his domain, decoratedwith different kinds of gems and metals, resembling Himavat mountain, wearing on his broad chest alocket shedding a white luster, resembling a Kaustubha gem (adorning the blossom of Lord Vishnu)and hanging in the middle of a single string of pearls, with a multitude of waves whirled aroundhim, encircled by the clouds and winds, escorted by rivers mainly the Ganga and Sindhu, endowedwith diverse forms resembling various deities, approached Rama with joined palms, who stood witharrows in hand, addressing him first as �Rama!' and spoke the following words:"
6-22-17,"O, beloved Rama! Earth, wind ether, water and light remain fixed in their ownnature, resorting to their eternal path."
6-22-18,"Therefore, I am fathomless and my nature is that it is impossible of being swumacross. It becomes unnatural if I am shallow. I am telling you the following device to crossme."
6-22-19,"O, prince! Neither from desire nor ambition nor fear nor from affection, I am ableto solidify my waters inhabited by alligators."
6-22-20,"O, Rama! I shall make it possible to see that you are able to cross over. I willarrange a place for the monkeys to cross me and bear with it. As far as the army crosses me, thecrocodiles will not be aggressive to them."
6-22-21,"Then, Rama spoke to that ocean as follows: ""Listen to me. This great arrow shouldnot go in vain. In which region should it be descended?"""
6-22-22,"Hearing Rama's words and seeing that powerful arrow, the large splendid Ocean spokethe following words to Rama:"
6-22-23,"Towards my northern side, there is a holy place. It is well known as Drumatulya, inthe same way as you are well known to this world."
6-22-24,"Numerous robbers of fearful aspect and deeds, having the sinful Abhiras as theirchief, drink my waters there."
6-22-25,"I am not able to bear that touch of those wicked people, the evil doers, O, Rama!Let this excellent arrow with out vain be released over them there."
6-22-26,"Hearing those words of the high-soled Ocean, Rama released that excellent andsplendid arrow towards that place as directed by the ocean."
6-22-27,"The place where the arrow, whose splendor was akin to that of a thunder and athunder bolt, was descended by Rama- that place is indeed famous as desert of Maru* on thisearth."
6-22-28,"The earth there, pierced by the dart, then emitted a sound . The waters of thepenultimate subterranean region gushed forth from the mouth of that cleft."
6-22-29,"Then the hollow became known as Vrana. Water constantly seen, gushing forth from itresembled seawater."
6-22-30,"A terrific splitting sound was born in that place. Water was dried up in thosecavities, as a result of hurling of that arrow by Rama."
6-22-31,"That desert of Maru became famous in the three worlds. Rama (the son of Dasaratha),a wise man and a valiant man resembling a celestial, made that cavity dried up and gave a boon tothat desert of Maru."
6-22-32,"Due to granting of a boon by Rama, that desert of Maru became the most congenialplace for cattle rearing, a place with a little of disease, producing tasty fruits and roots, witha lot of clarified butter, a lot of milk and various kinds of sweet- smelling herbs. Thus it becamean auspicious and suitable move, bestowing these merits."
6-22-33,"While that cavity was burning, Ocean the lord of rivers spoke these words to Ramawho knew all scientific treatises."
6-22-34,"O, excellent man! This one, named Nala, a glorious person, is the son ofVishvakarma; who was given a boon by his father and is equal to Visvakarma."
6-22-35,"Let this greatly energetic monkey build a bridge across me. I can hold that bridge.He is just the same as his father."
6-22-36,"Thus speaking, the god of Ocean disappeared from that place. Then Nala, the moredistinguished among monkeys stood up and spoke the following words to Rama of great power:"
6-22-37,"The great Ocean disclosed a truth. I will construct a bridge across this largeOcean, taking recourse to the skill and ability of my father."
6-22-38,"This Sagara, the formidable mass of water, in fear of punishment, gave a passage toRama, wishing to see a bridge constructed on it."
6-22-39,"On the mountain of Mandara, the following boon was given by Visvakarma to mymother: O, god like lady! A son equal to me will be born to you."""
6-22-40,"I am a son born of Visvakarma's own loins. I am equal to Visvakarma. This god ofOcean has reminded me. The great ocean spoke the truth. Being unasked, I have not told you mydetails earlier."
6-22-41,"I am capable of constructing a bridge across the ocean. Hence, let the foremost ofmonkeys build the bridge now itself."
6-22-42,"Then, being sent by Rama, hundreds and thousands of monkey heroes jumped in joy onall sides towards the great forest."
6-22-43,"Those army-chiefs of monkeys, who resembled mountains, broke the rocks and treesthere and dragged them away towards the sea."
6-22-44,"Those monkeys filled the ocean with all types of trees like Sala and Asvakarna,Dhava and bamboo, Kutaja, Arjuna, palmyra,Tilaka, Tinisa, Bilva, Saptaparna, Karnika, in blossom asalso mango and Asoka."
6-22-45,"The excellent monkeys, the forest animals lifted and brought, like Indra's flagposts, some trees with roots intact and some others without roots."
6-22-46,"From here and there the monkeys brought Palmyra trees, pomegranate shrubs, coconutand Vibhitaka, Karira, Bakula and neem trees."
6-22-47,"The huge bodied monkeys with mighty strength uprooted elephant-sized rocks andmountains and transported them by mechanical contrivances."
6-22-48,"The water, raised up due to sudden throwing of mountains in the sea, soured upwardtowards the sky and from there again, gushed back."
6-22-49,"The rocks befalling on all sides perturbed the ocean. Some others drew up strings ahundred Yojanas long (in order to keep the rocks in a straight line.)"
6-22-50,"Nala on his part initiated a monumental bridge in the middle of the ocean. Thebridge was built at that time with the cooperation of other monkeys, of terrible doings."
6-22-51,"Some monkeys were holding poles for measuring the bridge and some others collectedthe material. Reeds and logs resembling clouds and mountains, brought by hundreds of monkeys, leadby the command of Rama, fastened some parts of the bridge."
6-22-52,"Monkeys constructed the bridge with trees having blossom at the end of their boughs.Some monkeys looking like demons seized rocks resembling mountains and peaks of mountains andappeared running hither and thither."
6-22-53,"Then, a tumultuous sound occurred when the rocks were thrown into the sea and whenmountains were caused to fall there."
6-22-54,"On the first day, fourteen Yojanas of bridge were constructed by the monkeysspeedily, thrilled with delight as they were, resembling elephants."
6-22-55,"In the same manner, on the second day twenty Yojanas of bridge were constructedspeedily by the monkeys of terrific bodies and of mighty strength."
6-22-56,"Thus, on the third day twenty-one Yojanas of the bridge were constructed in theocean speedily by the monkeys with their colossal bodies."
6-22-57,"On the forth day, a further of twenty-two Yojanas were constructed by the dashingmonkeys with a great speed."
6-22-58,"In that manner, on the fifth day, the monkeys working quickly constructedtwenty-three yojanas of the bridge up to the other seashore."
6-22-59,"That Nala, the strong and illustrious son of Visvakarma and an excellent monkeybuilt the bridge across the sea as truly as his father would have built it."
6-22-60,"That beautiful and lovely bridge constructed by Nala across the ocean the abode ofalligators, shone brightly like a milky way of stars in the sky."
6-22-61,"With a desire to behold that marvel, celestials along with Gandharvas, the heavenlymusicians, Siddhas (semi-divine beings of great purity and perfection, possessing super naturalqualities) and great sages came then and stood up in the sky."
6-22-62,"The celestials and Gandharvas, the heavenly musicians saw Nala's bridge, having awidth of ten yojanas and a length of hundred yojanas and which was very difficult to be built."
6-22-63,"The monkeys taking long leaps and short leaps shouted in joy. All other beings sawthat construction of the bridge across the ocean as unimaginable, impossible and wonderful, causingtheir hair to stand on end in amazement."
6-22-64,"Those thousand crores of monkeys in a great spectacle reached the other shore of thegreat ocean soon after building that bridge across the sea."
6-22-65,"That colossal bridge, which was broad, well-constructed, glorious, well postured andheld together firmly, looked beautiful like a separating straight line in the ocean."
6-22-66,"Vibhishana, wielding a mace in his hand, stood up on the seashore along with hisministers, for the purpose of invading the enemies."
6-22-67,"Thereafter, Sugriva on his part spoke to Rama, the truly brave man as follows: ""O,valiant man! This ocean, the abode of alligators, is indeed vast. You ascend the shoulder ofHanuman and let Lakshmana ascend the shoulder of Angada. These monkeys can hold both of you whileflying in the sky."""
6-22-68,"Rama the glorious and righteous man, wielding a bow along with Lakshmana togetherwith Sugriva, went in front of that army."
6-22-69,"Some monkeys went along the middle of the bridge. Some others went along the sides.Some others were jumping into water. Some others marched forward on the path. Some monkeys enteredthe sky and aviated like Garuda the eagle."
6-22-70,"The highly terrific sound of the ocean was covered up by the great sounds of theterrific monkeys who were crossing the sea."
6-22-71,"That army of monkeys, which crossed the ocean by the bridge constructed by Nala, wasencamped by Sugriva at a shore having many fruits tubers and water."
6-22-72,"Seeing that Rama's accomplishment, which was amazing and arduous; celestials,Siddhas (semi-divine beings possessing supernatural faculties) and Charanas (celestial bards) alongwith great sages, forthwith approached Rama and consecrated him with very splendid watersseparately."
6-22-73,"The celestials, Siddhas and others exalted Rama, who was duly respected by kingswith their auspicious -words as follows: "" O, king! Defeat the enemies. Rule the earth and oceaneternally for years."""
6-23-1,"Rama, who was well acquainted with portents, on seeing the portents around, embracedLakshmana and spoke as follows:"
6-23-2,"O, Lakshmana! Acquiring this region endowed with cold water and woods abounding infruits, let us speedily divide this multitude of forces into battalions and drawing it up in battlearray, we shall stand attentive."
6-23-3,"I perceive an impending danger which will be terrific, causing destruction to theworld, and torture to the eminent heroes among bears monkeys and demons."

6-23-8,"The splendorous moon as though rising at the time of universal dissolution,invested with a black and red halo is tormenting the mind this night."
6-23-9,"O, Lakshmana! A dark stain appears on the cloudless solar disc, which isdiminished, dreary, inauspicious and coppery."
6-23-10,"O, Lakshmana! Look! Stars enveloped in enormous dust, appear to announce adissolution of the world."
6-23-11,"Crows, eagles and vultures are flying low. Jackals too are howling very dreadfuland inauspicious sounds."
6-23-12,"Earth will become a quagmire of flesh and blood, covered with rocks spears andswords hurled by monkeys and demons."
6-23-13,"Abounding with all the monkeys we shall attack the city ruled by Ravana, now itselfat a quick pace."
6-23-14,"Rama the lord, the conqueror of enemies and a charming man thus speaking, wielded abow and sallied forth in front, facing towards Lanka."
6-23-15,"All those excellent monkeys, together with Vibhishana and Sugriva making roaringsounds surged forth for the destruction of the audacious enemies."

6-24-2,"The earth pressed under foot by that multitude of army which was energetic like asea, was trembled with fear by the rapid movement of that army."
6-24-3,"Then the monkeys heard a great tumult arising in Lanka and noisy sounds ofkettledrums and tabours, which caused their hair to stand on end."
6-24-4,"The leaders of monkeys were rejoiced by that sound. But by not tolerating thatsound, they emitted shouts, which surpassed that uproar."

6-24-22,"Then, Rama with great splendor spoke the following words to Sugriva, ""Our forces areproperly marshaled. Let this Shuka be released."""
6-24-23,"Hearing the words of Rama, Sugriva the lord of monkeys released Shuka the messenger,as per the order of Rama."
6-24-24,"Shuka who was harassed by the monkeys and released then as per the words of Rama,was trembling with great fear and reached Ravana."
6-24-25,"Ravana, even while laughing, enquired Shuka with the following words: "" why wereyour wings tied up? You appear with your wings plucked up. Have you not fallen as a victim to theirvarious fickle minds?"""
6-24-26,"Asked as aforesaid by the king Ravana, Shuka agitated as he was with fear, gave himthe following excellent reply: ""On the northern shore of the ocean, I conveyed your message in asmooth tone, conciliating and without any ambiguity exactly as per your instructions."""
6-24-27,"Just on seeing me, the enraged monkeys jumped on me and seized me. They soonstarted beating and plucking me with their fists."
6-24-28,"O, Lord of demons! Those monkeys are not capable of being spoken to, or possible ofbeing questioned in this matter. Monkeys, by their very nature, are angry and ferocious."

6-24-32,"There is no more possibility of an alliance between these two armies - the army ofdemons and the army of monkeys- than between a God and a demon."
6-24-33,"Very soon they will come to our rampart. Immediately, do any one of these two acts-either to restore Sita or to offer a combat to him."
6-24-34,"Hearing the words of Shuka, Ravana with his eyes becoming blood red in anger, as ifhe would consume him with his glance, said as follows:"
6-24-35,"Even if I were frightened by all the worlds or even if I were to face a battle withcelestials or Gandharvas (celestial singers) or demons, I would not give back Sita."
6-24-36,"When will my arrows soon fall upon Rama, as large black bees excited with joy fallupon a tree in bloom at spring time?"
6-24-37,"When shall I consume his body flowing with blood, by the blazing arrows releasedfrom my bow, as flaming torches destroy an elephant?"
6-24-38,"Endowed with a huge army I shall eclipse the aforesaid army of Rama, as thebrilliance of all stars is obscured at the rising of the sun."
6-24-39,"My rashness is like that of the sea and my strength is like that of the wind. Ramais not aware of it. That is why, he is desirous of meeting me in a combat."
6-24-40,"Rama has not seen my arrows resembling venomous serpents lying in my quiver. Thatis why, he desires to fight with me."
6-24-41,"Rama was not formerly aware of my prowess in battle. I shall cause to resound Vina(a musical instrument) in the form of my bow, which is played on with the heads of my arrows, thebow string producing a tumultuous sound, the huge cries of the wounded its terrible accompaniment,the darts sounding its innumerable notes, when I enter a vast stage in the form of my enemy ranksin that battle."""
6-24-42,"Neither by the thousand eyed Indra the god of celestials nor by Varuna the God ofwaters in person in a combat, nor by Yama the god of death with the fire of his arrows, nor byKubera the lord of riches in person, can I be able to be attacked in a great battle."
6-25-1,"While Rama, the son of Dasaratha, crossed the ocean along with his army, theillustrious Ravana spoke to Shuka and Sarana, his ministers as follows:"
6-25-2,"The entire army of monkeys crossed the impassable ocean. The construction of thebridge, unprecedented, across the ocean was executed by Rama."
6-25-3,"I am not able to believe under any circumstances that a pass-way has beenconstructed across the ocean. Certainly, that army of monkeys is worth to be counted (carriedweight) by me."
6-25-4,"Become unrecognisable to others, enter the army of monkeys and make out the realquantum of their army, their prowess, as to which monkeys are important among them, which ministersof Rama and Sugreeva have come together, which monkeys are abiding in front, which monkeys arevaliant, how that bridge was constructed across the ocean full of water, how the encamping is donefor those great-souled monkeys; the determination, strength and the striking senses of Rama and ofthe heroic Lakshmana."
6-25-5,"Knowing also accurately who the Chief of Army of those high-souled monkeys is, youhave to come back quickly."
6-25-6,"Having thus been commanded by Ravana, the valiant demons Shuka and Sarana , both inthe disguise of monkeys, entered that army of monkeys."
6-25-7,"Shuka and Sarana were not able to count then that inconeviable army of monkeys,causing their hair to stand on end."
6-25-8,"That army was stationed on the tops of mountains, round about the waterfalls, in thecaves, on the sea-shores, in the woodlands and in the gardens. It was either in the process ofcrossing the ocean, or was intending to cross it in its entirety. It had either encamped or wasstill encamping, making a terrible noise. The two demons saw that very strong and imperturbable seaof army."
6-25-9,"Vibhishana with great splendour beheld both of them in disguise. He caught hold ofShuka and Sarana and told Rama as follows:"
6-25-10,"O, Rama the conqueror of hostile citadels! These two demons are Shuka and Sarana,the ministers of Ravana and they came here as spies from Lanka."
6-25-11,"Both of them, having seen Rama, were trembled with fear, without any hope for theirlives and having joined their palms, spoke the following words:"
6-25-12,"O, excellent man! O, Rama! We both of us, as sent by Ravana, came here together toknow everything about your entire army."
6-25-13,"Hearing their aforesaid words, Rama the son of Dasaratha who was interested in thewelfare of all beings, smilingly spoke the following words:"

6-25-15,"Even if you have not seen something you may see it now also. Otherwise, Vibhishanawill show it to you again entirely."
6-25-16,"You, having been caught, need not fear about your life. The captured messengersholding no weapons indeed deserve no killing."
6-25-17,"O, Vibhishana! Always try to draw a bow-string on the opponents and not on thesetwo demons. Set them both, who are spies in disguise, free."

6-28-25,"O, king! Carefully observing this army, which appears much the same as a blazingplanet, prepare yourself for a great effort to get victory and take measures to avoid defeat fromthe enemies."
6-29-1,"Beholding those foremost of monkey leaders pointed out by Shuka- the most valiantLakshmana; Rama's right arm, his own brother Vibhishana standing close to Rama, the terriblypowerful Sugreeva the king of all monkeys, the strong Angada grandson of Indra the wielder ofthunderbolt, the powerful Hanuman, the imincible Jambavan, Sushena, Kumuda, Nila, Nala theexcellent of monkeys, Gaja, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Mainda and Dvivida- that Ravana - his heart becameagitated a little, was enraged and then abused those two heroes Shuka and Sarana who had completedtheir report."
6-29-2,"Ravana spoke (the following) excited and harsh words, in a voice choked in anger toShuka and Sarana who stood saluting with their faces bent down."
6-29-3,"It is not befitting to utter unpleasant words by dependent ministers to their kingwho has the power to mete out any punishment or reward."
6-29-4,"Is it proper for both of you to shower irrelevant praise on our enemies who areadverse to us and are approaching for a war?"
6-29-5,"In vain have you sat at the feet of your elders, your preceptors and the aged,since the essence to be followed from political sciences has not been grasped by both of you."
6-29-6,"Or if you have imbibed them, you have not remembered them. You are over-burdenedwith ignorance! Being associated with such foolish ministers, it is a miracle that I am still ableto retain my sovereignty."
6-29-7,"Have you no fear of death that you dare address me thus rudely, I whose tongue thatyou dare tongue dispenses good and evil?"
6-29-8,"Trees may survive in the forest, even if disturbed by fire. But the guilty cannotsurvive, if touched by the royal scepter."
6-29-9,"If my anger is not softened by the services they rendered earlier, I would havekilled thse two miscreants who are praising the band of enemies."
6-29-10,"Keep away from my neighbourhood. Do not be seen anywhere here. I am recollectingyour past services and hence do not wish to kill you. Both of you, who are ungrateful andunfaithful towards me, are just as dead to me."
6-29-11,"Hearing Ravana's words, Shuka and Sarana felt ashamed to see Ravana paid obeisanceto him saying, ""Be thou victorious!"" and went away."
6-29-12,"The demon Ravana spoke to Mahodara who was standing nearby as follows: ""Bring me thespies here quickly."""
6-29-13,"Hearing those words, Mahodara immediately ordered for the spies. The spies camehurriedly as per the orders of the king, paid obeisance to him by joining their palms andapproached him, having made a complement expressing their desire to see him victorious."
6-29-14,"Then, Ravana the king of demons spoke the following words to those spies, who werefaithful, brave, energetic and free from fear:"
6-29-15,"You go from here to investigate about the first impression concerning Rama, asregards who are his intimate friends and in respect of those who joined on his side with a likingtowards him."
6-29-16,"Find out what are his hours of sleeping and waking and what he intends to do next.You ought to come here, after acquainting with all this information completely and skillfully."
6-29-17,"An enemy in battle, got known through spies by kings, will be defeated with only alittle of effort."
6-29-18,"Those spies on their part delightfully replied, ""May it be so"", kept Shardula intheir front and made their circumambulation clockwise around Ravana."
6-29-19,"Having thus made circumambulation to Ravana the excellent and the distinguisheddemon, the spies went to the place where Rama along with Lakshmana were there."
6-29-20,"Having gone in a disguised manner, those spies saw Rama and Lakshman together withSugreeva and Vibhishana in the neighbourhood of Mountain Suvela."
6-29-21,"Seeing that army, those demons became overwhelmed with fear. However, they wereobserved by the high-souled Vibhishana the Lord of demons."
6-29-22,"Accidentally, the deomons there were caught by Vibhishana, who said that the demonShardula among them was wicked and got him alone seized."
6-29-23,"That Shardula also, who was going to be killed by the monkeys, was got released byRama. The other demons also were got released by Rama, the kind man."
6-29-24,"Those demons, harassed by the courageous and the quick-paced monkeys, becameinsensible, heaved a sigh and reached back Lanka."
6-29-25,"Those spies, who always wander outside and who were valiant rangers of the night,thereafter approached Ravana and informed him that Rama's army was camping in the vicinity of theSuvela mountain."
6-30-1,"Thereafter, the spies informed Ravana about Rama, with his unperturbable army,having encamped on Suvela Mountain."
6-30-2,"Hearing from the spies about the arrival of Rama, the exceedingly strong man, Ravanabecame a little perturbed and spoke to Shardula as follows:"
6-30-3,"O, demon! Your complexion is not so as it should be. You look miserable too. I hopethat you have not fallen a victim to the enraged monkeys."""
6-30-4,"Thus questioned by Ravana, Shardula afflicted with fear, then sluggishly spoke thefollowing words to Ravana the tiger among demons:"
6-30-5,"O, king! Those strong, bold and excellent monkeys protected by Rama are not capableof being spied upon."
6-30-6,"They are not capable of being talked with and nothing can be found in interrogatingwith them. The entire path is being protected by the monkeys looking like mountains."
6-30-7,"I was identified when that army was merely penetrated into (by me) and began to beexamined. I was seized forcibly by the demons (forming the retinue of Vibhishana), who investigatedme in various ways."
6-30-8,"I was beaten on all sides with knees, fists, teeth and palms by the enragedmonkeys. I was also paraded round in the midst of their army."
6-30-9,"Having been paraded all around thus, I was finally taken to the court of Rama. Allmy limbs were bleeding and Rama. All my limbs were bleeding and I was trembling, with my sensesdisturbed."
6-30-10,"While being plagued by the monkeys and asked for protection with joined palms, Iwas saved fortunately by Rama, saying �stay!stay!'"
6-30-11,"Rama has filled the sea with boulders and rocks, taking up his position at thegates of Lanka and stands there, well-equipped with weapons."
6-30-12,"Having released me, Rama of great splendour arranged the army in the form of Garuda(an eagle). He is encircled on all sides by the monkeys and is approaching towards Lanka."
6-30-13,"Before he reaches the ramparts, do one thing or the other quickly or give awaySeetha immediately or even offer him battle."
6-30-14,"Having heard those words, Ravana the lord of demons reflected on it and thereafterspoke the following significant words to Shardula."
6-30-15,"I will not give away Seetha even if the celestials or Gandharvas the celestialmusicians or the demons were to fight against me or even under danger from all beings."
6-30-16,"After uttering the aforesaid words, the heroic Ravana again spoke as follows: ""Hasthe army been espied by you? Who are the valiant monkeys among them?"""
6-30-17,"O, the virtuous gentle Shardula! What radiance do the monkeys, who are difficult tobe conquered possess of? what kind? Whose sons and grandsons are they? You tell me thatinformation."
6-30-18,"After knowing their strengths and weakness, I will decide in this matteraccordingly. Is it not necessary to count clearly those who are really yearning to fight thebattle?"
6-30-19,"Hearing Ravana's words, Shardula the excellent spy then started to narrate thesewords for Ravana's information:"
6-30-20,"Certainly, king Sugreeva, the son of Riksharajasa, is difficult to be conquered inbattle. Here is the son of Gadgada, famously called as Jambavan."
6-30-21,"The other one is the son of the same Gadgada. Another one is the son of Brihaspatithe teacher of Indra the lord of celestials, called Kesari by whose son Hanuman the demons weredestroyed."
6-30-22,"O, king! Here is Sushena the son of Yama the Lord of Death who is valiant andvirtuous, as well as a monkey called Dadhimukha, the cool-minded, who is the son of moon."
6-30-23,"Sumukha, Durmukha and a monkey called Vegadarshi are surely the personifications ofdeath in the form of monkeys, created by Brahma, the Lord of creation."
6-30-24,"Here is Nila the army-general himself, the son of Agni the Lord of Fire. Here isthe son of Vayu the Lord of Wind well- known as Hanuman."
6-30-25,"The young Angada, Indra's grandson, the strong and invincible one, both the mightyMainda and Dvinda born of the two divinties of Ashvin* as well as Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabhaand Gandhamadhana the five sons of Yama the God of Death all of them resembling Yama at the time ofdissolution of the world, the valiant ten crores of monkeys who are yearning for battle are allhere. I cannot venture to tell about the remaining glorious sons of god."
6-30-26,"This young man is Rama, Dasartha's son, who is well-built like a lion, by whomDushana ws killed as also Khara and Trishana."
6-30-27,"There is no one on earth who is equal in prowess to Rama, by whom Viradha waskilled as also Kabandha who was equal to Yama."

6-30-31,"There is the prince of demons Vibhishana, your brother, who having secured the cityof Lanka (as a prospective gift from Rama) remains devoted to the good of Rama."
6-30-32,"Thus, I have described about the entire army of monkeys stationed on the MountSuvela. Now, it is for you to decide what remains to be done!"
6-31-1,"Agitated to learn that Rama had arrived to Lanka and is stationed at Suvela mountain along with his army, Ravana confers with his ministers and after dismissing them, approaches Seetha with Vidyujjuha, knower of conjuring tricks. Informing Seetha that her husband along with his army had been killed in battle, he produces before her an illusive Rama&#39;s head along with bow and arrows created with Vidyujjuha&#39;s conjuring trick. Thus, Ravana deceives Seetha about the death of Rama."
6-31-2,"The spies of king Ravana informed him that Rama with his imperturbable army was encamped at Mount Suvela in Lanka."
6-31-3,"Hearing through his spies that Rama with his mighty army had arrived to Lanka, Ravana was a little agitated and spoke to his counsellors as follows:"
6-31-4,"The time for deliberation has come to us. Let our ministerial colleagues come quickly with their keenly attentive minds."
6-31-5,"As per his command, the ministers came instantly. Ravana conferred with the ogres, his ministers."
6-31-6,"The dreadful Ravana discussed about the ensuing things to be done immediately. He sent away the ministers and entered his palace."
6-31-7,"Thereafter, Ravana the practiser of conjuring tricks, took the exceedingly strong Vidyujjihva who was a great sourcerer along with him and went to Seetha&#39;s place."
6-31-8,"Ravana the lord of demons spoke to Vidyujjihva, who was a knower of conjuring tricks as follows: With your spells, create an illusion in order to deceive Seetha, daughter of Janaka."
6-31-9,"O, demon! Produce a head resembling Rama&#39;s along with a great bow and arrows created deceptively and present yourself before me."
6-31-10,"Hearing Ravana&#39;s words, the demon Vidyujjihva said, Be it so. He showed to Ravana those things of his conjuring trick, well-performed. The king became satisfied of his work and gave him an ornament (as a gift)."
6-31-11,"The exceedingly strong Ravana the suzerain lord of demons, duly entered the Ashoka grove, eagerly longing for the sight of Seetha."
6-31-12,"Then, Ravana the younger brother of Kubera ( the god of riches) saw Seetha the unfortunate one, who did not deserve that fate, seated on the ground with her head bent down in the Ashoka grove plunged in grief as she was and absorbed in the thought of her husband."
6-31-13,"Then, approaching Seetha who was attended upon by ghastly ogresses seated not far distance from her and mentioning his own name with great delight, Ravana spoke the following audacious words to Seetha."
6-31-14,"O, Beautiful one! He in whom you trusted and repelled me when I sought to console you - that murderer of Khara, your husband Rama has been killed in battle."
6-31-15,"O, Seetha! Your root has been cut off in all ways by me and your pride has been slain. By your present evil predicament, you will become my wife."
6-31-16,"O, Foolish one! Give up this resolution. What will you do with one dead. O, beautiful one! Become the Chief Queen over all my consorts."
6-31-17,"O, Foolish one, with scant virtue and failed purpose! You think yourself as wise! O, Seetha! Hear about the dreadful killing of your husband in battle, as the killing of the demon Vritra (at the hands of Indra)"
6-31-18,"Rama, encircled by an extensive army led forward by Sugreeva, is said to have arrived at the sea-shore, to kill me."
6-31-19,"While sun was going to set, Rama with his mighty army was encamped there, encroaching upon the northern shore of the sea."
6-31-20,"Their army stationed there, comfortably asleep at the middle of the night and completely fatigued in the course of the journey, was approached first and espied by our spies."
6-31-21,"By my great army, which was led by Prahasta, Rama&#39;s army was killed in the night at the place where Rama and Lakshmana were there."
6-31-22,"The demons wielding harpoons, maces, discus, daggers, sticks, great arrows spears, shining maces with spikes, picks lances, darts, massed weapons, clubs and circular missiles, made use of them again and again in order to strike down the monkeys."
6-31-23,"The impetuous Prahasta, with his steady hand, severed the head of Rama sleeping there, with his mighty sword without a resistance from any one."
6-31-24,"Fortunately, Vibhishana was over leaped and held captive. Lakshmana along with the monkeys were made to run away in all directions."
6-31-25,"O, Seetha! Sugreeva the king of monkeys with his neck broken and Hanuman with his jaw removed were laid down and killed by the demons."
6-31-26,"Thereafter Jambavan who was rising up on his knees was killed in the battle. His body was cut off with many sharp-edged spears, like a tree is cut off."
6-31-27,"Mainda and Dvivida - those two great scourgers of their foes, the long bodied and the foremost of the monkeys, groaning and breathless, their limbs bathed in blood-were cut to pieces at the waist-level, by a sword."
6-31-28,"Panasa, crying for help was stretched on the earth under a tree of the same name. Pierced by lying in a pit. The exceedingly valiant kumuda on his part, shrieking, was killed by a hail of missiles."
6-31-29,"Angada, who was adorned with bracelets lies fallen down, emitting blood on all sides, as he was pierced by the demons with many arrows, after approaching him."
6-31-30,"The monkeys sleeping there were crushed by elephants and multitude of chariots, like clouds are crushed to pieces by the velocity of wind."
6-31-31,"The enemy fled in terror, pursued by demons, while being struck on the bak, like lions pursuing great elephants."
6-31-32,"Some monkeys fell in the sea and some sought shelter in the sky. The bears with the monkeys climbed the trees."
6-31-33,"By the demons with monstrous eyes, were killed a multitude of monkeys, at the shores of the sea, in the mountains an in the woods."
6-31-34,"Thus, your husband together with his army was killed by my troops. This head, drenched in his blood and besmeared with dust has been gathered up."
6-31-35,"Thereafter, Ravana the Lord of demons who was very much difficult to be attacked, spoke the following words to an ogress, while Seetha was overhearing them."
6-31-36,"Bring Vidyujjihva, the demon of the cruel deed, by whom himself Raghava&#39;s head was brought back from the battle-field."
6-31-37,"Holding that head along with a bow, Vidyujjihva making a respectful salute with his head bent low, stood in front of Ravana."
6-31-38,"Thereafter, the king Ravana spoke the following words to Vidyujjihva, the demon who had a large tongue and who was standing and moving closely."
6-31-39,"Keep Rama&#39;s head immediately in front of Seetha. Let the miserable Seetha see well the final condition of her husband."
6-31-40,"Hearing Ravana&#39;s words, that demon deposited the cherished head in the vicinity of Seetha and soon disappeared from the site."
6-31-41,"Here is Rama&#39;s bow famous in the three worlds! - saying thus, Ravana threw a great shining bow in front of Seetha."
6-31-42,"This is the bow with its cord stretched, belonging to Rama, that was brought back by Prahasta here, after killing that hero in the night."
6-31-43,"That Rama&#39;s head and bow on the ground in front of Seetha the illustrious daughter of Janaka, saying: You now become submissive to my desire."
6-32-1,"Seetha saw the illusory head and bow. She heard Ravana narrating about Rama&#39;s friendly relationship with Sugreeva, as earlier apprised by Hanuman. Recognizing that head as that of Rama, with a proof resembling her husband&#39;s eyes, facial complexion, hair, expanse of his forehead and the beautiful jewel worn on the top of his head, she was very much afflicted with sorrow, cried like an osprey and abused Kaikeyi who was the originator of the present calamity (as follows):"
6-32-2,"Kaikeyi! Be a fulfiller of your craving! This Rama, causing a joy to the family, has been slain. The entire race has been destroyed by a woman of squabbling nature."
6-32-3,"You gave clothes made of bark to the venerable Rama and sent him on exile to the forest along with me. What harm has he done to you?"
6-32-4,"Thus speaking, Seetha the miserable girl was trembling and fell on the ground like a plantain tree that was cut off. Thus speaking, Seetha the miserable girl was trembling and fell on the ground like a plantain tree that was cut off."
6-32-5,"The wide eyed Seetha thereafter was consoled in a moment, regained consciousness, approached near that illusory head and lamented as follows:"
6-32-6,"O, the long armed Rama! The pursuer of a strong will! Alas, you have been killed! I have become a witness to your last fate. I have been made a widow."
6-32-7,"It is said that the early death of a husband is the misfortune of a wife. You, having good conduct, have preceded me in death."
6-32-8,"Even you who were actually intent on protecting me, fallen in great affliction and immersed in an ocean of grief, have been killed by the enemies"
6-32-9,"O, Rama! My mother- in-law Kausalya who cherished you tenderly has been left without a son and resembles a cow that has lost its calf."
6-32-10,"O, Rama! It was mentioned even by astrologers that your life span is lengthy. O, Rama! Their words are wrong. You are short lived."
6-32-11,"Otherwise, your prudence might have disappeared even though you were sagacious, for, Time the master of all beings has brought you to an end."
6-32-12,"How is it possible that you, who knew the doctrine of political ethics obtained an unforeseen death? You, who knew the science of expediency, were indeed skilled in warding off calamities"
6-32-13,"O, Rama, the lotus eyed! The night of destroying time which was very much cruel and terrible thus has encircled you, embezzled you and snatched you away from me."
6-32-14,"O, the mighty armed! O, the best of men! Leaving the miserable me, you lied down here, embracing the earth as your beloved"
6-32-15,"O, valiant Rama! Here is your bow which was decorated with gold, dear to me and worshipped diligently by you with sandal paste and wreath of flowers."
6-32-16,"O, the faultless Rama! Surely, you must have met in heaven your father and my father-in- law Dasaratha as well as all the multitude of manes."
6-32-17,"You have abandoned your own pious lineage of royal sages but whereas you performed a great act, which illuminated the heaven like a luminary."
6-32-18,"O, prince! Why don&#39;t you look at me? Why don&#39;t you reply me, a wife who lived with you together since the time of obtaining me as a girl by you as a boy."
6-32-19,"O, Rama! Remember your solemn promise at the time of our marriage, saying I shall have righteous conduct with you&#39; Take me also with you, wretched as I Am."
6-32-20,"O, Rama the best of beings! Why have you gone away, quitting me like this? Leaving me, the miserable woman, why have you gone to the other world from this world?"
6-32-21,"That beautiful body, which was cuddled by me with divine essences, is now being dragged about by wild beasts."
6-32-22,"Why are you not securing the privilege of being cremated with a sacrificial fire, even though you have worshipped the Lord through sacrificial performances such as Agnishtoma, duly furnished with abundant gifts?."
6-32-23,"Kausalya absorbed as she was with grief can only see Lakshmana alone returned out of the three who attained exile."
6-32-24,"He will narrate surely to her when enquired, about your slaughter as also the killing of the army of your alley, by demons at night."
6-32-25,"O, Rama! Hearing that you were killed while sleeping and that I was kept in the house of ogres, she will be no more, as her heart will be broken."
6-32-26,"The strong and faultless prince Rama was killed in a small puddle, after crossing the ocean, for the cause of me, an unworthy woman."
6-32-27,"I, the obloquy of my race, was wedded by Rama due to ignorance. Thus, a wife herself has eventually proved to be the cause for death of Rama, an honorable man."
6-32-28,"Even though I was a wife of Rama who showed hospitality to all the guests, it is I, that very person, who is weeping here and now, because without doubt, in a previous existence, an excellent gift was refused by me (to an eligible person)."
6-32-29,"Unite the wife with the husband and without delay, arrange to kill me right at the head of Rama. Thus, you will perform an admirable and auspicious act."
6-32-30,"O, Ravana! Join my head with his head and my body with his body. I shall go along the path of my magnanimous Lord."
6-32-31,"The wide-eyed Sita, seeing her husband&#39;s head and bow there again and again, was tormented with grief and lamented as aforesaid."
6-32-32,"While Seetha was lamenting thus, a demon who was a royal guard approached his Lord there with his joined palms in salutation (and cried as follows):"
6-32-33,"May you be victorious, O noble Lord! he respectfully announced thus, thereby winning his pleasure and informed that Prahasta the army chief had come."
6-32-34,"O, Lord! Prahasta has come with all ministers. He has sent me, eager as he is, to see you."
6-32-35,"O, king, endowed with patience! There is a little urgent work by way of king&#39;s duty. Please accord them your audience now."
6-32-36,"Hearing the aforesaid communication of the demon, Ravana left the garden of Ashoka and bestowed audience to his ministers."
6-32-37,"He deliberated with his ministers as to what action in its entirety to be pursued and entered the council-chamber and issued his commands in accordance with the knowledge he possessed of Rama&#39;s forces."
6-32-38,"Soon after the departure of Ravana, the illusory head and bow had vanished."
6-32-39,"Then, Ravana the king of demons in consultation with his highly powerful ministers, decided on the measures he would adopt against Rama."
6-32-40,"Ravana the king of demons, resembling Yama the god of death, addressed all the generals standing nearby, devoted to his interests as follows:"
6-32-41,"By a sound of a drum beaten audibly with a drum stick, immediately summon all my forces. Do not tell them the reason for which I am calling."
6-32-42,"Then, the messengers answered, So be it obedient as they were to his words and instantly gathered a huge army together and informed their lord longing for fight, that they had since assembled the army."
6-33-1,"Seeing the bewildered Seetha, a demon named Sarama*, an affectionate femalecompanion then approached Seetha, her beloved Seetha, her beloved friend."
6-33-2,"Sarama, the soft-spoken woman, consoled Seetha who having been infatuated by Ravanawas very much in distress."
6-33-3,"Sarma, who was assigned by Ravana to guard Seetha, was kind hearted and firm inausterity. She was indeed made a companion by Seetha, who was being protected by her there."
6-33-4,"The affectionate Sarama found Seetha stupefied and just risen after rolling in thedust and soiled, resembling a female horse."
6-33-5,"Sarama consoled the very virtuous Seetha as follows ""O, Seetha! Be comfortable! Donot get perturbed in your mind."
6-33-6,"timid woman! Because of my friendship with you, I overheard Ravana's words and allthe words you have spoken in reply to him, by hiding nearby in a barren sky without fear. O, largeeyed woman! I do not have any fear of Ravana, owing to my affection towards you""."
6-33-7,"O, Seetha! Every thing was ascertained by me on the spot, after going out, aboutthe reason for which Ravana has gone away agitated."
6-33-8,"It is not possible to attack Rama, a man of self awareness, while he is asleep. Nayeven killing him, the tiger among men, is well nigh impossible."
6-33-9,"It is not possible to kill in this manner even monkeys, who perform fighting withtrees, in as much as they are fully protected by Rama, even as celestials are protected by Indratheir lord"
6-33-10,"O, Seetha! Rama, who is endowed with long and well rounded arms, an illustriousman, who is large-chested, a man of great energy, an archer well known in the world, a man endowedwith muscularity, a righteous minded man, a person of celebrity on earth, a man of eternalstrength, a protector for himself and for others, while together with his brother Lakshmana, a manof high descent, a knower of doctrines of conduct and behavior, the killer of a stream of enemyforces, a man of inconceivable strength and valor, a venerable man and an annihilator ofadversaries, has not been killed."
6-33-11,"A trickery has been hurled on you here by the cruel Ravana, a conjurer, who isperverse in thinking and action and an enemy of all beings."
6-33-12,"Your sorrow is (now) gone once for all. An all-pervading auspiciousness will awaityou. Accordingly prosperity will attend on you. Hear me."
6-33-13,"Rama, along with his army of monkeys, having crossed the ocean, reached itssouthern shore and is encamped there."
6-33-14,"Rama, who was along with fully meaningful Lakshmana, was perceived by me. He standsprotected by the troops gathered together at the vicinity of the ocean."
6-33-15,"Some swift paced demons, who were dispatched by Ravana, brought this very news herethat Rama has crossed the ocean."
6-33-16,"O, the wide-eyed Seetha! Hearing that news, yonder Ravana is busy makingdeliberations with all his ministers."
6-33-17,"While Sarama, the ogre was talking as aforesaid with Seetha; a terrific sound washeard, from the troops engaged in the impending war."
6-33-18,"Hearing the crashing sound of kettle drums, made to sound like a thunder storm witha drum stick, Sarama in her sweet voice spoke to Seetha as follows:"
6-33-19,"O, timid Seetha! This frightful sound of a kettledrum is indeed indicative ofpreparation for a war. Hear also the thundering crash of the kettle drums, which resembles therumbling of clouds"
6-33-20,"Elephants in rut are being caparisoned for war. Chariot horses are being preparedfor a battle. Thousands of horsemen carrying darts in their hands are seen."
6-33-21,"Thousands of soldiers equipped with armor are marching quickly hither and thither.Royal highways are filled with wonderfully looking warriors like a swift flowing sea with its floodof waters making a roaring sound."
6-33-22,"See hurriedly, this sheen of polished weapons, shields and coats of mail sendingforth luster of many hues like the splendor of fire consuming a forest in summer. Here is seen theflurry of chariots, horses and elephants following the lead of Ravana as well as of energeticdemons thrilled with joy."
6-33-23,"Hear the sound of bells of elephants. Hear the ratting of chariots. Hear the cry ofneighing horses, resembling the flourish of trumpets. Here is the bustle of demons, carryinguplifted weapons in their hands; following the lead of Ravana. This bustling activity is causinghair to stand erect through terror."
6-33-24,"A good fortune, which will bring your sorrow to an end, awaits you. A peril hasarrived for demons. The lotus eyed Rama, your husband, who has overcome his anger but having anunimaginable strength will kill Ravana in battle and win you back"
6-33-25,"Your consort along with Lakshmana will show his valor against the demons, likeIndra the lord of celestials along with Vishnu the lord of preservation, the annihilator of enemiesexhibited his strength over his adversaries."
6-33-26,"Very soon, I shall see you, mounted on the lap of Rama who actually arrived, yourobject of his coming being fulfilled and the enemy fallen."
6-33-27,"O, Seetha! You will shed tears of joy on the bosom of that broad-chested Rama, re-united with you and holding you clasped to his breast."
6-33-28,"Before long, O divine Seetha, that mighty Rama will loosen the one single plaitwhich has reached past your hips, which you have worn these many months."
6-33-29,"O, Queen! Seeing his face, looking like a rising moon, you will renounce your tearsborn of grief, like a female snake casts off its slough."
6-33-30,"O, Seetha! Having killed Ravana in combat within no time, Rama (who deservesfacility); will enjoy happiness in the company of the beloved, namely yourself."
6-33-31,"Acclaimed by the high soled Rama, you will be so happy as how the earth, endowedwith crops, feels after the onset of good rains."""
6-33-32,"O, queen! Seek refuge now with him - the sun that rolls towards Meru the highestmountain, like a horse that makes its round rapidly. That sun is indeed the source of allcreatures."
6-34-1,"Seetha, who was overwhelmed with anguish on hearing Ravana's words, was comfortedand rendered happy by Sarama, as parched earth is solaced by rain."
6-34-2,"Desiring to be of further service to her friend Seetha, the affectionate Sarama,skilled in the knowledge of time, smiling while talking, spoke the following words at thatappropriate time."
6-34-3,"O, black eyed lady! I am capable of carrying a message of your words and good willto Rama and to return secretly."
6-34-4,"When I am journeying in the sky self -supported, neither the god of wind nor Garudathe eagle can follow my movement."
6-34-5,"To Sarama, who was speaking as aforesaid, Seetha her voice no longer charged withgrief, gently and sweetly replied in the following words:"
6-34-6,"You are capable of going to heaven or to the penultimate subterranean region. Knowfrom me today the duty that has got to be performed by you for my sake."
6-34-7,"If your intention is to act kindly towards me and your resolve is firm , I wish youto go and know what Ravana is doing now."
6-34-8,"That cruel and evil minded Ravana, equipped with strength in the shape of conjuringtricks, who makes his enemies cry has bemused me, as spirituous liquor bemuses one, the moment itis imbibed."
6-34-9,"He causes me to be threatened by words all the time by the most frightful ogresses,who always surround me and insult me by their act repeatedly."
6-34-10,"I am depressed in mind and distrustful. My mind is not in its natural state.Staying in Ashoka grove, I am distressed because of his fear."
6-34-11,"Report to me, all that is decided by him during his talk going on with hisministers about the matter of releasing me or keeping me captive. It will be of great service tome."
6-34-12,"The soft spoken Sarama, wiping her face, which got moist with tears, replied asfollows to Seetha who was speaking as aforesaid:"
6-34-13,"If your opinion is like this, I shall go on that account, O, Seetha! Having graspedthe feeling of the enemies, I shall return O, Seetha!"
6-34-14,"Speaking thus, Surama thereafter went to the vicinity of that demon and heard theconversation of Ravana who was with his ministers."
6-34-15,"Sarama, who knew how to investigate could hear the wicked Ravana's resolve and soonreturned to Ashoka grove."
6-34-16,"Sarama, who entered the Ashoka grove, saw Seetha who looked like Lakshmi the goddessof prosperity (and the wife of Vishnu); bereft of the lotus and waiting for her only."
6-34-17,"Seetha affectionately embraced the kindly speaking Surama who returned there andoffered personally a seat to her."
6-34-18,"Sitting here comfortably, tell me about the real design of that cruel and wickedRavana"
6-34-19,"When Seetha trembling with fear enquired thus, Sarama narrated all the conversationof Ravana together with his ministers."
6-34-20,"Excellent words were spoken by Kaikasi, the mother of Ravana as well as Aviddha theaged minister asking for your release, O Seetha!"
6-34-21,"Let Seetha, be restored honorably to Rama the Lord of men. That wonderful** thinghappened in Janasthana is an enough eye- opener to you."
6-34-22,"Which mortal would accomplish the crossing of the ocean, the discovery of Seetha byHanuman, and the carnage of the demons in combat on this earth?"
6-34-23,"Though admonished in many ways by the aged ministers and his mother he is notinclined to set you free, any more than a miser would leave his hold on his riches."
6-34-24,"O, Seetha! He does not want to release you, without dying himself in a battle. Thisis the resolve of the cruel Ravana along with his ministers."
6-34-25,"'-""Thereafter, due to infatuation caused by his impending death, his aforesaiddetermination is very firm .He is not in a position to release you, not through sheer fear, butuntil he is actually defeated in battle through the carnage of all the demons and of himself."""
6-34-26,"O, dark eyed Seetha! Killing Ravana by his sharp arrows in combat, Rama will takeyou back to Ayodhya by all means."
6-34-27,"In the meantime was heard the sound of all the monkey troops blended with the soundof kettle drums, causing earth to shake."
6-34-28,"Hearing that sound of that monkey troops, the servants of Ravana stationed in Lankawere lack- luster with their movements, overcome by depression. They did not see anything salutaryin it, owing to the fault of their king."
6-35-1,"The mighty armed Rama, the conqueror of hostile cities sallied forth with theresonant roll of kettle drums, mingled with the blast of couches."
6-35-2,"Hearing that sound, Ravana the Lord of demons, paused for a moment to reflect andlooked towards his ministers."
6-35-3,"Ravana of great strength the tormentor of the world, and a cruel lord of demons thenaddressed all his ministers in a voice that resounded the entire hall as follows, accusingnone."
6-35-4,"I have heard what you told me about Rama's crossing the ocean, his prowess,strength and heroism."
6-35-5,"I know that you are truly brave in the battle-field, yet, on beholding that valiantRama, you too look on each other in silence."
6-35-6,"Hearing those word of Ravana whose maternal grandfather he was, the highlyintelligent demon called Malyavan, answered him thus:"
6-35-7,"O, king! He who is well-versed in (fourteen)* sciences and follows the path ofprudence, enjoys sovereignty for a long time and compels his enemies too into subjugation."
6-35-8,"He who concludes peace even with enemies or wages war at a fitting time strengthenshis own party and attains a great power."
6-35-9,"A treaty of peace should be reached by a king who is weaker or equal to an enemy.The king should never underrate that enemy. If the king is more powerful, he should make war on theenemy."
6-35-10,"O, Ravana! For that reason, alliance with Rama finds favour with me. Let Seetha,for whose sake you are being attacked, be restored to him."
6-35-11,"All the celestials, sages and Gandharvas the celestial musicians are wishing forvictory of Rama. Do not get an enmity with them. Let alliance with him be acceptable to you."
6-35-12,"Brahma, the lord of creation, created only two classes of beings, the celestialsand the demons. Celestials take refuge in righteousness and demons in unrighteousness."
6-35-13,"O, Ravana! Righteous is said to be on the side of the high-souled celestials.Unrighteousness is indeed on the side of ogres and demons."
6-35-14,"When righteousness swallows unrighteousness, it becomes kR^ita Yuga, a golden age.When unrighteousness swallows righteousness, it incites Kali Yuga the fourth age."
6-35-15,"Therefore, while you were wandering in the worlds, even the great righteousness wasdestroyed and unrighteousness favoured by you. So, the enemies are stronger than us."
6-35-16,"Due to your negligence, that well nourished unrighteousness is swallowing us. Beingfavourable to demons, the sect of demons is thereby getting augmented."
6-35-17,"You, who are interested in sensual enjoyments, doing whatever you like, havecreated a great alarm in the sages, having the nature of fire."
6-35-18,"The power of those sages is insurmountable like an igniting fire. Having purifiedtheir minds through penance, they are intent on promotion of righteousness, in as much as theseBrahamans worship the gods through different principal sacrifices, also pour oblations into thesacred fires with due ceremony and read the Vedas (Sacred texts) in a loud voice. Having subduedthe demons, they continued to chant the sacred text, on hearing which all the demons scattered inall directions, as thundering clouds in a hot season."
6-35-19,"The smoke coming forth from the sacred fire of the sage who resemble the fire (inbrilliance), enveloping the ten directions, takes away the magical power of the demons."
6-35-20,"The severe austerity practised by the sages, firm of resolve, in differentcountries torment the demons."
6-35-21,"You received a boon of invincibility from celestials, demons and semi-divinebeings, but then are men, bears as well as powerful and very efficacious having strong prowess whoare coming hither, roaring like lions."
6-35-22,"By seeing various kinds of unexpected events (portents) and many types of terrificthings, I am perceiving a destruction of all the demons."
6-35-23,"With terrifying clamour, monstrous clouds, inspiring horror, rain hot blood onLanka on every side."
6-35-24,"Drops of tears drop from the weeping elephants, horses etc., whose skins becamediscoloured, covered with dust and are not shining as before."
6-35-25,"Flesh-eating animals, jackals and eagles and howling horribly. Entering Lanka, theyare in the groves, forming into groups."
6-35-26,"Black women, chattering incoherently in dreams and robbing different houses standin front, laughing loudly with their white teeth."
6-35-27,"Dogs devour the sacred offerings offered in homes. Donkeys are born of cows andrats of mongoose."
6-35-28,"Cats mate with tigers, pigs with dogs, Kinnaras (a species of demi-gods with thehuman figure and the head of a horse or with a horse's body and the head of a man) with demons andmen."
6-35-29,"Red-footed and white pigeons, messengers of death, move in different directions,foretelling the extermination of demons."
6-35-30,"Domesticated minas (a kind of birds) making a chirping sound, defeated by otherbellicose birds drop down, being twined together in groups."
6-35-31,"Birds and wild animals, facing towards the sun, cry out. Death, in the form of afrightful, monstrous and cruel blackish fellow with a shaven head casts his eyes on all ourdwellings, both morning and evening. These and such other sinister omens appear."
6-35-32,"I deem Rama of firm fortitude as Vishnu dwelling in human form. This Rama is not amere human being, he by whom that most wonderful bridge was built across the sea. O, Ravana!Conclude peace with Rama, who is the king of men. Having come to know of his acts, let that whichis good for the future be done after a mature understanding."
6-35-33,"Having spoken thus, the mighty Malyavan, who was foremost in valour among thebravest warriors, being aware of what was passing in Ravana's mind, eyeing him, became silent."
6-36-1,"The evil- minded Ravana the ten-faced monster, who had fallen under the sway of Death; could not brook that beneficial advice tendered by Malyavan."
6-36-2,"He had fallen under the sway of anger, knitting his brows on the face as he was, rolling his eyes in fury and spoke to Malyavan (as follows)"
6-36-3,"I have closed my ears to the speech you have made, albeit with good intentions and even by taking sides with the enemy."
6-36-4,"How can you hold Rama, who is a mere human being, a small feeble man, taking help from monkeys and dwelling in a forest having been abandoned by his father, to be a competent person?"
6-36-5,"How can you hold me, the Lord of demons, terrifying celestials and possessing all powers in full, to be a weaker person?"
6-36-6,"I suspect that you spoke these harsh words to me because of your envy of my prowess or your partiality towards the enemies or my lenience towards you."
6-36-7,"Which learned man, understand the truth in the scriptures, would speak thus harshly to a mighty person in power, were it not to instigate him?"
6-36-8,"Why should I give back Seetha, who is like Lakshmi the goddess of fortune without the lotus, having brought her away from the forest, through fear of Rama?"
6-36-9,"See Rama killed within a few days by me, along with Lakshama together with Sugreeva in the midst of crores of monkeys."
6-36-10,"How should this Ravana, whom in combat, the celestials themselves dare not meet in a duel, entertain fear in this encounter?"
6-36-11,"Rather would I be cut into two pieces than bend before anybody! Such was I from birth, it is my nature by difacult and unalterable."
6-36-12,"What great marvel is there in that which gave way to terror if by happy chance, a bridge indeed was constructed by Rama across the ocean."
6-36-13,"That Rama along with his army of monkeys, having crossed the ocean, will not go back alive. It is my true promise to you."
6-36-14,"Beholding Ravana to be highly excited and speaking with such fury, Malyavan, abashed, did not reply."
6-36-15,"Invoking blessings of victory to the king as courtesy demanded Malyavan took permission and went home."
6-36-16,"Ravana the demon on his part, assisted by his ministers having deliberated on the things to be examined, set about planning the defense of Lanka."
6-36-17,"Thereafter, he assigned the eastern gate to the demon, Prahasta and the southern gate to Maha Parshva and Mhodara both of great prowess. At the western gate, he placed his son Indrajit, a powerful conjuror, with considerable force of demons."
6-36-18,"Placing Shuka and Sarana at the northern city-gate, Ravana told his ministers that he would go there personally."
6-36-19,"He place the demon Virupaksha, who was full of energy and courage, to be in the center of the fort, with a large number of demons."
6-36-20,"Making an arrangement in Lanka in this manner, that bull among demons, under the sway of Time, deemed his purpose as accomplished."
6-36-21,"Having ordered for adequate arrangements for the defence of the city, Ravana then let his ministers depart. Having been honoured with blessings of victory by the body of counsellors, he entered his mighty and sumptuous inner apartments."
6-37-1,"Meanwhile, Rama the king of men and Sugreeva the Sovereign of monkeys, Hanuman theson of the wind, Jambavan the king of the Bears, Vibhishana the demon, Angada the son of Vali,Lakshmana, Sushena along with his kinsfolk, Mainda, Dvivida, Gaja, Gavaksha, Kumuda, Nala andPanasa, all having reached the enemy's territory, assembled to take counsel together."
6-37-2,"Observe this city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana, impregnable both to celestials and thedemons together, or the uragas (the serpent-demons) and Gandharvas (celestial musicians)."
6-37-3,"Ravana, the lord of demons always stays in the City. Think of the ways and meansfor the success of our expedition."
6-37-4,"While they were talking thus, Vibhishana the younger brother of Ravana spoke thefollowing meaningful and polished words:"
6-37-5,"My counsellors named Anala, Panasa, Sampati and Pramati went to the City of Lankaand returned here."
6-37-6,"Assuming the form of birds, all the four entered that enemy's citadel and observedthe measures taken by Ravana closely."
6-37-7,"O, Rama! I give a detailed report as it was given to me of the defence-arrangementsmade by tha evil-minded Ravana, hear me."
6-37-8,"The very strong Prashata is standing near the eastern gate. Mahaparshva andMahodara of mighty prowess are at the southern gate."
6-37-9,"Indragit, the son of Ravana is at the western gate along with many demons armedwith harpoons, swords, bows, spears and hammers together with warriors furnished with weapons ofvarious kinds."
6-37-10,"A prey to great anxiety, Ravana knower of magical formulas, is himself stationed atthe northern gate, along with several thousands of demons holding lances in their hand."
6-37-11,"As for Virupaksha he with mighty army carrying spears, clubs and bows along withother demons, occupies the center of the fort."
6-37-12,"All these counsellors of mine watched those groups of troops arranged in Lanka inthis manner and immediately returned here."
6-37-13,"The elephants and chariots number some ten thousand each, the cavalry twentythousand and there are more than a crore foot soldiers. These strong and intrepid demonsendeavouring to kill someone in battle have ever been their sovereign's favourites."
6-37-14,"O, Rama! In these demons, a retinue of ten lacs each is near at hand for eachdemon."
6-37-15,"The mighty armed Vibhishana showed those counsellors to Rama after reporting theaforesaid news pertaining to Lanka, thus informed by his counsellors."
6-37-16,"The counsellors of Vibhishana themselves confirmed all that was known regardingLanka. Thereafter, the illustrious Vibhishana, in his desire to please Rama, addressed thatlotus-eyed one, further with the following words:"
6-37-17,"O, Rama! When Ravana attacked Kubera in battle, sixty lacs of demons sallied forthwith him. All of them were akin to the evil-minded Ravana in prowess, in strength, in courage andin pride."
6-37-18,"Indignation need not be resorted to (by you) based on this report. I am notterrifying you, bt only arousing your wrath. You are indeed capable of overpowering even celestialsby your valour."
6-37-19,"Having set out these monkey-forces in battle-array, you shall destryoy Ravana withthis great army of monkeys, composed of four divisions, which surround you."
6-37-20,"Vibhishana having spoken thus Rama gave the following orders for the attack of theadversaries."
6-37-21,"At the eastern gate of Lanka, Nila that lion among monkeys for his part, surroundedby many monkeys, should attack Prahasta."
6-37-22,"At the southern gate, Angada the son of Vali, surrounded by his mighty army, shouldoppose Mahaparshva and Mahodara."
6-37-23,"Let Hanuman that son of the Wind and of inscrutable spirit, surrounded by amultitude of monkeys, enter the City through the western gate."
6-37-24,"I am myself determined to slay that wicked who owing to the boon he has received,enjoys oppressing multitudes of Daityas (gaints) and Daanavas (demons), as also the magnanimoussages and who ranges the world, persenting all being. With the aid of Lakshmana, I shall forciblyenter the northern gate where Ravana is stationed along with his army."""
6-37-25,"Let the mighty Sugreeva the king of monkeys, the valiant Jambavan the king of bearsand Vibhishana, the younger brother of the Lord of demons occupy the central position of thearmy."
6-37-26,"Monkeys should not assume human form in the battle, for, in the army of monkeys,this monkey-shape should serve as a sign of recognition among us."
6-37-27,"Among our own people also, the form of monkeys will become a sign of recognitionfor us. Seven of us will attack the foe in our human form, I, my brother Lakshmana, who is full ofvalour, my friend Vibhishana and his four companions."
6-37-28,"Having said thus to Vibhishana for the success of the enterprise, Rama in the roleof a wise leader, decided to stay on Mount Suvela, after observing its charming slopes."
6-37-29,"Thereafter, having covered the entire filed with his great army and having made uphis mind to destroy the enemies, that high-souled Rama of great courage, set out for Lanka with ajoyous and exultant air."
6-38-1,"Rama, who was followed by Lakshmana, having made up his mind to ascend Mount Suvela, spoke in a gentle and prime voice to Sugreeva and to Vibhishana who was the knower of what is right, a demon devoted to him who was experienced in counsel and a knower of prescribed rules (as follows):"
6-38-2,"We shall ascend up on high this Suvela mountain, shining well with hundreds of minerals. All of us will stay on this mountain for this night."
6-38-3,"We shall see Lanka the abode of that demon, Ravana the evil-minded by whom my wife was taken away for the sake of his own death, by whom virtue was not understood, good character was not known and noble lineage was not seen and by whom that contemptible act was done with an inferior demoniacal mind."
6-38-4,"My anger is increased on hearing the name of that demon. Because of the offence committed by him, I shall see that all these demons are destroyed."
6-38-5,"Falling into that power of trap of death, one does an evil act. Because of the offence committed by him the vilest, his lineage is destroyed."
6-38-6,"Rama, thus thinking of Ravana in anger, approached and ascended the mountain of Suvela with its conspicuous summits."
6-38-7,"Lakshamana too who took delight in his own valour and steadfastness, keeping ready his mighty bow with arrows, followed behind Rama Sugreeva along with his ministers and Vibhishana ascended the mountain, by following him."
6-38-8,"Hanuman, Angada, Nila, Mainda, Dvivida, Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, Panasa, Kumuda, Hara, Rambha the chief of the troop, Jambavan, sushena, the greatly wise Rishabha, Durmukha of great splendour, Shatabali the monkey and other hundreds of monkeys which are fast-moving, which can wander easily on mountains with a speed akin to that of wind, ascended that Suvela mountain which Rama ascended."
6-38-9,"Having ascended the mountain from all sides within no long time, they saw at its apex, the city of Lanka which appeared as though it was hanging in the sky."
6-38-10,"The chiefs of monkey-troops saw that beautiful City of Lanka, furnished with excellent gates, enriched with exquisitc ramparts and pervaded all over with demons."
6-38-11,"Those excellent monkeys saw another rampart formed out of the black demons so standing together scribble on that existing exquisite rampart."
6-38-12,"Seeing the demons who were craving for war, all those monkeys made various types of noises, while Rama was witnessing the scene."
6-38-13,"Then, the sun reddened with evening-twillight went down and the night shining with full moon arrived."
6-38-14,"Thereafter, Rama along with Lakshmana as well as Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys together with troops and captions of troops, duly greeted welcomingly and treated hospitably by Vibhishana, halted happily on the mountain resort of Suvela."
6-39-1,"The valiant army-chiefs of monkeys stayed on Suvela mountain for that night and sawthe garden and groves in Lanka."
6-39-2,"Seeing those gardens which were levelled, beautiful, spacious, majestic andenchanting to look at, they became astonished."
6-39-3,"Thick with Champaka, Ashoka, Vakula Sala and palmyra trees, covered with groves ofTamala and Panasa trees, surrounded with rows of Nagakesara trees, Lanka looked splended on allsides like the city of Amaravati reigned by Indra the god of celestials, with green lawns andvariegated avenues and with beautiful trees of various kinds like Hintala, Arjuna, Nipa Saptaparnain full flowering, Tilaka, Karnikara and Patal whose crests were laden with flowers and which wereintertwined with climbers laden with multi-coloured flowers and red tender leaves."
6-39-4,"The trees there were laden with fragrant and greatly enchanting flowers and fruits,as human beings were laden with ornaments."
6-39-5,"That garden, which bore flowers and fruits in relation to all seasons and with fullof bees, like chaitraratha (garden of Kubera, the god of riches), was quite charming, like Nandana(garden of Indra the Lord of celestials)"
6-39-6,"In that garden abounding in cascades, the songs of birds like gallinules,lapwings(small white cranes), dancing peacocks and cuckoos were heard."
6-39-7,"Then, those monkeys, thrilling with rapture, delighted, brave and assuming any shapeat will, entered the aforesaid groves and gardens, with birds ever excited with joy, wandered bybees, with clusters of trees occupied by cuckoos, having variegated sounds of birds and song of thelarge bees, abounding with sounds of ospreys, with the music of wagtails and cries of canes."
6-39-8,"While those mighty and splendid monkeys were entering the groves a breeze withflowery fragrance, delightful to the nose, blew."
6-39-9,"Some other troop-leaders of the valiant monkeys came out of their troops with duepermission from sugreeva and went towards Lanka, the city adorned with flags"
6-39-10,"Those monkeys, great in making noises causing the birds to frighten and displeasingto the animals and elephants, went, causing that Lanka to tremble, by their noises."
6-39-11,"Those monkeys with great speed marched ahead, making the earth flattened by theirfeet and the dust thus raised by their feet went up instant aneously."
6-39-12,"Frightened by that sound, bears lions buffaloes elephants, deers and birds weretrembled and terrified and hastened towards ten different directions."
6-39-13,"The solitary peak of Trikuta mountain, which is so high as if touching the sky, allover covered with flowers entirely, resembling gold; to an extent of eight hundred miles; bright;charming to look at, beautiful, glorious, majestic, inaccessible even by birds, hard to be ascendedby people may, even by the mind-how much more by an act of walking?"
6-39-14,"Lanka, ruled by Ravana, with a breadth of eighty mile and a length of one hundredsixty miles, was located on the apex of the mountain there."
6-39-15,"The city of Lanka looked beautiful with its towering City-gates resembling whiteclouds as well as with golden and silver ramparts."
6-39-16,"The city of Lanka, greatly adorned by palaces and seven storied mansions, lookedlike the sky with clouds at the end of a summer and as a region of Vishnu (the god of preservation)between earth and heaven."
6-39-17,"A palace, duly graced with a thousand pillars, which looked like a peak of MountKailasa was three in the City of Lanka, which was always the City of Lanka, which was alwaysprotected by a complete army of demons. The palace seemed to be scraping the skies and was to beseen as an ornament to the City of Ravana."
6-39-18,"The glorious Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana along with monkeys saw thatcharming golden city of Ravana, graced with mountains picturesque with various minerals, splendidwith gardens reechoing with songs of birds of every kind, frequented by varieties of deer, richlyendowed with various kinds of flowers, inhabited by demons of every degree and duly flourishing,having increased its wealth."
6-39-19,"Beholding that City, which looks like heaven and crammed with huge palaces, thevaliant Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana was seized with astonishment."
6-39-20,"Rama with his great army saw that City, full of precious gems, having all kinds offacilities, adorned with rows of mansions, having excellent doors with huge mechanical appliancesand with a large armed forces protecting the City."
6-40-1,"Then, Rama along with Sugreeva, together with the troop leaders of monkeys, ascendedthe top of Suvela mountain which was having a circumference of sixteen miles."
6-40-2,"Halting there just for a while and surveying the ten cardinal points, Rama saw thecity of Lanka, which was beautifully constructed by Visvakarma, the divine architect on the top ofTrikuta Mountain with nice arrangements and ravishing with enchanting groves."
6-40-3,"There above a gateway, stood the invincible Ravana the lord of demons, who was beingfanned with white whisks on both sides, was graced with a triumphal parasol, was smeared with redsandal paste, adorned with scarlet ornaments, attired in raiment embroidered in gold, resembling adark cloud, who bore on his breast scars of wounds inflicted on him by Airavata (the elephant whocarries Indra the Lord of celestials, on his back) with his tusks, wrapped in a cloak of red colourresembling the colour of hare's blood and looked like a mass of clouds in the sky enveloped withsunshine at sunset."
6-40-4,"On seeing Ravana, Sugreeva got up all at once, while Rama and the chiefs of the armyof monkeys were looking on."
6-40-5,"Gathering up his strength and courage, Sugreeva, in an impulse of fury, bounded fromthe summit of the mountain and then sprang to the top of the gate (where Ravana was)."
6-40-6,"For a moment, he paused and then with a fearless soul, he saw that demon, whom heregarded as a mere straw and thereafter spoke the following words harshly:"
6-40-7,"O, demon! I am a friend and a servant of Rama, the Lord of the world. You will notbe spared by me today, by the inspiring grace of Rama."
6-40-8,"Thus speaking, Sugreeva jumped up all at once, bounced over on ravana, pulled hisbrightly coloured crown from his head and threw it away on the ground."
6-40-9,"Seeing Sugreeva about to rush upon him again, Ravana spoke as follows: ""You wereSugreeva (one who has a handsome neck), when your were not present before my eyes. But now, youwill now become Hinagriva bereft of your neck."""
6-40-10,"Speaking thus, Ravana raised up and quickly flung Sugreeva to the ground with bothhis arms. Bouncing like a ball, Sugreeva flung back his adversary with his arms."
6-40-11,"Ravana and Sugreeva of great strength carried on a duel which was unbearable, withperspiration broke out on their limbs, with their bodies red with blood, each clung to other otherparalyzing his opponent's movements resembling silk-cotton and Kimshuka trees, followed by blows offists, slaps of hands blows of elbows and blows of fingers on each other."
6-40-12,"Having wrestled for a long time in the center of the flat floor of the gate way,each in turn repeatedly lifting their bodies and bending their feet in a particular way, the twohighly swift combatants remained in that flat roof of the gate way."
6-40-13,"Crushing one another and their bodies clung together, they both dropped down betweenthe defensive walls and the moat. They would leap up again, seizing each other from the ground,after pausing an instant to regain their breath."
6-40-14,"With arms interlaced like with ropes joined together, they remained locked togetherin the struggle. Both of them, who had received training in wrestling and fully endowed with night,were now moving to and fro in the arena."
6-40-15,"The two heroes, who resembled a tiger and a a lion having their tusks growing or twoyoung lordly elephants encountening in a hostile manner, with arms interlaced and having duly triedtheir strength, fell on the ground together."
6-40-16,"Thereafter rising, those two heroes hurled themselves on each other, circling aroundthe arena again and again, like skilled and mighty wrestlers, nor were they easily fatigued."
6-40-17,"Like unto great tuskers with their enormous arms resembling the trunks, those twowarriors were keeping back each other, fought vehemently for a long time and moved speedily in acircular arena."
6-40-18,"Approaching each other like tow wild cats fighting over a piece of meat trying tokill each other, they stood growling again and again."
6-40-19,"The two warriors, Sugreeva and Ravana, who were skilled in wrestling, excutedinnumerable and myraid evolutions, taking up diverse postures, moving in a curved line like an ox'surine, coming and going, stepping side ways, having a retrograde motion to avoid blows, turningabout abandoning the attack, dashing towards each other, leaping, standing firm and erect,retreated, turned sideways, rushed in a bent posture, ran lifting their foot to kick the opponentand by letting go or stealing away."
6-40-20,"Meanwhile, Ravana decided to common using his magic power. Knowing it, Sugreeva flewinto the sky triumphantly shaking off all fatigue, while Ravana, baffled by Sugreeva stoodconfounded there alone."
6-40-21,"Thus, the Lord of the monkeys, acquiring fame as a warrior, reducing Ravana toexhaustion, ascended into the infinite sky and the offspring of the Sun then went to the side ofRama, who as in the middle of the mokye-troops."
6-40-22,"That Sugreeva, the offspring of the Sun, who was endowed with a speed of the wind,having accomplished that feat there, increasing the military zeal of the foremost of Raghu dynasty,honoured by the monkey leaders and delighted, rejoined the army."
6-41-1,"Seeing the marks of conflict on the person of Sugreeva, Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana after embracing Sugreeva spoke these words."
6-41-2,"Without consulting me closely, such a reckless act has been done by you, such a rashness is not seemly in a king."
6-41-3,"O, warrior longing for acts of daring! This wrong and reckless act has been done by you, causing me, this army and Vibhishana great anxiety."
6-41-4,"O, warrior! O, vanquisher of foes! Do not act thus in future. O, the mighty armed! O, annihilator of enemies! If you have come by some misfortune, I would have had nothing to do with Seetha, Bharata, Lakshmana or still younger Shatrughna or even with my own person."
6-41-5,"O, monkey of great strength, equal to Indra the god of celestials and Varuna the king of universe! If you have not returned, though I am conversant with your valour, this was my pre-determined resolve that having killed Ravana in fight with his sons forces and chariots, I should have installed Vibhishana as king of Lanka, placing the kingdom of Ayodhya in the hands of Bharata and renounced my life."
6-41-6,"Hearing Rama&#39;s words, Sugreeva replied as follows: O, brave Rama! Seeing Ravana who had taken away your consort and being conscious of my own strength, how can I act otherwise?"
6-41-7,"Complimenting that hero Sugreeva who was thus speaking, Rama addressed Lakshmana, who was endowed with auspicious marks, saying:"
6-41-8,"O, Lakshmana! Beside these fresh waters and trees laden with fruit, let us divide this multitude of troops, drawing it up in a battle array and remain alert."
6-41-9,"I foresee a terrible calamity to come, boding universal destruction and death to the intrepid bears, monkeys and demons."
6-41-10,"Harsh winds blow. The earth trembles. Mountain-peaks shake and the elephants bearing the earth trumpet."
6-41-11,"Sinister clouds prey-roar violently like carnivorous animals and let fall a rain mixed with drops of blood."
6-41-12,"The dusk, red as sandal, is full of horror and from the sun, this blazing mass of fire falls."
6-41-13,"Wile beasts and birds emit frantic cries, ill at ease and ominous, inspiring great fear, facing the sun."
6-41-14,"The moon shorn of its radiance, surrounded by black and fiery rays, burns red as at the time of destruction of the word and is creating an anguish in the night."
6-41-15,"O, Lakshmana! In the disk of the sun, a small halo with a black mark, fiery, shorn of its radiance and of coppery hue is seen."
6-41-16,"O, Lakshmana! The stars are not appearing as they should be duly foretelling their intention to hasten a final dissolution of the world."
6-41-17,"Crows, eagles and vultures are whirling round at a lower level. Jackals too are howling inauspicious sounds."
6-41-18,"The earth, crowded with rocks, darts and daggers discharged by monkeys and demons, will become a slime of flesh and blood."
6-41-19,"Now surrounded by the monkeys from all sides, let us make an attack on that invincible citadel ruled by Ravana quickly and swiftly."
6-41-20,"Thus speaking to Lakshmana, the heroic Rama of great strength climbed down from that mountain-peak."
6-41-21,"Having descended from that mountain, Rama, whose mind was set on righeousness, held a review of his own army, which was verily difficult to conquer for the enemies."
6-41-22,"Rama, who knew the fitting moment to act, along with Sugreeva made ready the great army and commanded the army to advance, at the appropriate moment for the battle."
6-41-23,"Rama, the mighty armed, together with the mighty army marched in front, wielding a bow, towards the city of Lanka, at the befitting moment."
6-41-24,"Then, Vibhishana, Sugreeva, Hanuman, Jambavan the king of bears, Nala, Nila and Lakshmana accompanied that Rama."
6-41-25,"Thereafter, fully covering a vast stretch of land, the great army of bears and monkeys, followed in the wake of Rama."
6-41-26,"Monkeys, the annihilator of enemies, resembling elephants, took hold of mountain-peaks and hundreds of well-grown huge trees."
6-41-27,"Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the destroyers of their adversaries, reached the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, in not a long time."
6-41-28,"The monkeys, encouraged by the sound of Rama&#39;s voice and obedient to his command, halted before the city of Lanka, garlanded with banners, beautiful and splendid with pleasure-gardens, having an unusual rampart which is inaccessible with its elevated arched door-ways and invincible even by the celestials."
6-41-29,"Reaching the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, the heroic Rama the son of Dasaratha accompanied by Lakshmana, halted near the northern gate, where Ravana stayed. Who else but Rama is capable of protecting the army besieging that gate, regulated by Ravana, as an ocean, regulated by Varuna, guarded by awful demons on all sides and creating fear to the weak as a subterranean region is guarded by demons?"
6-41-30,"Rama saw various types and multitude of weapons and shields kept there by the warriors."
6-41-31,"Nila, the valiant army-chief of monkeys together with Mainda and Dvivida reached and halted before the Eastern gate."
6-41-32,"Angada of very mighty prowess, together with Rishhabha, Gavaksha, Gaja and Gavaya took charge of the Southern gate."
6-41-33,"The strong monkey Hanuman together with Prajangha, Tarasa and other warriors, guarded the western gate."
6-41-34,"Sugreeva, along with all the chiefs of monkeys equal to the strength of Garuda (the eagle and the vehicle of Vishnu) as well as Vayu the god of the wind, was stationed himself in the middle of the fort."
6-41-35,"Thirty six crores of monkeys, highly renowned generals stood besiezed, where the monkey Sugreeva was there, having exerted pressure on the demons occupying that post."
6-41-36,"Meanwhile, under Rama&#39;s command, Lakshmana along with Vibhishana distributed a crore each of his monkeys at each gate."
6-41-37,"Behind Rama and not far from him, Sushena together with Jambavan, followed by a multitude of forces, stood at the intermediate post."
6-41-38,"Those lions among the monkeys, possessing the teeth of tigers, taking hold of trees and rocks, waited delightedly for the signal to fight."
6-41-39,"All of them were lashing their tails feverishly, using their jaws and nails as weapons, trembling in every limb and had their faces set grimly."
6-41-40,"Some were having the strength of ten elephants, some a ten times of that and some were equal to the strength of a thousand elephants."
6-41-41,"Some were having the strength of an ogha* of elephants. Some were endowed with a strength of ten times to that. some others there were chiefs of monkeys, having an immeasurable strength."
6-41-42,"Marvellous and astonishing was the gathering of those troops of monkeys there, like a swarm of locusts."
6-41-43,"By the monkeys who reached Lanka and by those stationed already beneath its walls, the air and earth seem to be completely filled."

6-41-47,"The demons, who in their valour equaled Indra the ruler of gods, seeing themselves besieged, as by clouds, were struck with sudden terror."
6-41-48,"While the flock of monkey- troops was advancing there, a tremendous clamour arose, resembling a roar in the ocean beating against its shore."
6-41-49,"By that great tumult, the entire Lanka with its ramparts arches, hills, woods and forests began to tremble."
6-41-50,"That army of monkeys, guarded by Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva became even more invinceible than all the celestials and demons put together."
6-41-51,"Having thus ranged his forces, with a view to destroy the demons, Rama who knew about the four expedients (to be used against an enemy in the shape of conciliation, gift, sowing dissension and punishment) employed in succession, took counsel again and again with his ministers and arrived at a decision. Calling to his mind the duty of the kings, Rama who was eager to undertake what was to be done next, in concurrence with Vibhishana, summoned Angada the son of Vali and spoke as follows:"
6-41-52,"Go my gentle Angada on my behalf and, passing thought the city of Lanka without fear and anxiety and Lanka without fear and anxiety and approaching Ravana - the unfortunate demon devoid of sovereignty and who has lost his splendour because of his inclination to die - admonish him in the following words:"
6-41-53,"O, Ravana the Ranger of the Night! In your reckless arrogance, sages, celestials, celestial musicians and their wives, serpent - demons, yakshas the semi-divine beings and kings have been oppressed by you. From now on, that arrogance, born of the boon you received from Brahma the Lord of creation, shall be subdued."
6-41-54,"I shall inflict a fitting penalty for your ruthless abduction of my consort. I am stationed myself at the gate of Lanka, with a Rod of chastisement."
6-41-55,"O, demon! Slain by me, you will attain the region of Gods, of all the great sages and all the royal sages."
6-41-56,"O, the worst demon! Demonstrate the same courage and magic that you did employ in bearing Seetha away from me."
6-41-57,"If you do not make an appeal to my clemency by returning Seetha, I shall make this world devoid of all demons."
6-41-58,"This pious minded Vibhishana, the foremost of demons has come to me. Surely, this illustrious demon will obtain the kingdom of Lanka, which will henceforth be free from troubles."
6-41-59,"You, without a knowledge of the self and a sinful demon having stupid followers around you, cannot indeed enjoy the kingdom even for a moment, by this unrighteousness."
6-41-60,"O, demon! Otherwise, get ready for a battle, by gathering courage and laying hold of your valour. Having been slain by my arrows in combat, you will be laid in peace."
6-41-61,"O, Ranger of the Night! Even if you range the three worlds in the forms of a bird, you will not return alive, when you come into my range of sight."
6-41-62,"I give you this salutary counsel prepare for your obsequies. Let Lanka be obliged to be seen well by you (like your last sight), as your survival is in my hands."
6-41-63,"Hearing the words of Rama, who was unwearied in action, Angada the son of Tara, leapt into air like a god of fire personified and marched ahead."
6-41-64,"Reaching Ravana&#39;s palace in an instant, the illustrious Angada saw Ravana, seated coolly along with his ministers."
6-41-65,"Angada, the foremost of the monkeys, wearing golden bracelets, descended close to the king and stood there like a flaming torch."
6-41-66,"Having made himself known, Angada communicated, that whole of the excellent speech of Rama without adding or subtracting anything to Ravana in the presence of Ravana&#39;s ministers, saying:"
6-41-67,"I am the son of Vali, Angada by name. I have come as a messenger for the king of Koshala, Rama of imperishable exploits. Has my name ever reached your ears?"
6-41-68,"Rama who is born in Raghu dynasty and who augements the joy of Kausalya speaks thus to you, �O, ruthless demon! Come forth and enter into combat. Prove to be the representative of your race!&#39; "
6-41-69," �I shall kill you along with your ministers, sons, cousins and other relatives. You being dead, all the three worlds will be rid of fear.&#39;"
6-41-70," �Now, I shall uproot you, a thorn to sages and an enemy to celestials, demons, semi-divine beings, celestial musicians, serpent-gods and ogres&#39;."
6-41-71,"If you do not restore Seetha honourably, by bowing respectfully before me, you are slain and Vibhishana will become the king.&#39;"
6-41-72,"Hearing these harsh words from Angada the lion among the monkeys, Ravana the Lord of the demon-tribe was infuriated."
6-41-73,"Then, the enraged Ravana repeatedly commanded his attendants, saying: Let this stupid monkey be seized and put to death."
6-41-74,"Hearing Ravana&#39;s words, four terrible demons seized Angada who, in his splendour, resembled a blazing torch."
6-41-75,"Then, the prudent and heroic Angada the son of Tara voluntarily allowed himself to be seized, in order to display his prowess before the host of demons."
6-41-76,"Then, seizing like unto birds those attendants clung to his arms, Angada leapt on to the palace that resembled like a mountain."
6-41-77,"All those four demons were shaken out by Angada&#39;s impetuous leap and fell on the ground there under the eyes of their king."
6-41-78,"Thereafter, the glorious Angada the son of Vali ascended the roof of Ravana&#39;s palace, which equaled the summit of a mountain in height."
6-41-79,"That roof of the palace, trampled by Angada, crumbled - as a peak of Himalayan range was shattered long ago by lightening - before Ravana&#39;s gaze."
6-41-80,"After destroying the roof of the palace, Angada proclaimed his name and with a triumphant roar, rose into the air."
6-41-81,"Causing restlessness to all the demons but delight to the monkeys, Angada approached close to Rama, who was stationed in the middle of the monkey-forces."
6-41-82,"Because of the destruction of his palace, Ravana on his part got extremely angry. Foreseeing his own destruction, he became a desponded demon."
6-41-83,"Surrounded by many monkeys, roaring with delight, Rama on his part was proceeding ahead already for the battle, with an intent to wipe out the enemy."
6-41-84,"Now, Sushena the highly valiant monkey, was stationed there like the head of the mountain surrounded by innumerable monkeys, who were bale to change their form at will."
6-41-85,"Under the order of Sugreeva, the invincible monkey, Sushena was patrolling the gates and wandering like a moon among the stars."
6-41-86,"Seeing hundreds of divisions of those monkeys encamped under the walls of Lanka, marshaled on the shores of the sea, the demons were amazed and some others were terror-struck while others, overjoyed at the prospect of fighting, leapt even in exultation."
6-41-87,"Those miserable demons saw the entire extensive space between the walls and the moat being occupied by the monkeys, like unto a second rampart. The demons cried out, Woe! Alas! in panic."
6-41-88,"As a result of that appalling tumult in the capital city of the demons, the soldiers of Ravana seized hold of their great weapons and sallied forth like the winds that blow at the dissolution of the worlds."
6-42-1,"Then, the demons there, approached Ravana and informed him that the city had beenbesieged by Rama along with his monkeys."
6-42-2,"Hearing that the city has been attacked, Ravana exhibiting his anger, doubly madethe necessary arrangements for the war and ascended his mansion."
6-42-3,"That Ravana caught a glimpse of the city of Lanka, with its mountains, groves andforests all being covered by innumerable troops of monkeys, waiting for war."
6-42-4,"Seeing the earth made all brown with innumerable monkeys, Ravana in great perplexityreflected: ""How can they be exterminated?"""
6-42-5,"Having pondered for long, regaining his confidence and with his eyes widened bysurprise, Ravana gazed on Rama and his troops of monkeys."
6-42-6,"Full of delight, Rama passed forward (on the back of a monkey) along with his armyand saw Lanka being guarded on all sides and thronged with demons."
6-42-7,"Seeing that city of Lanka duly decorated with banners and flags, Rama rememberedSeetha with a distressed heart."
6-42-8,"He said to himself, ""Here is that daughter of Janaka, whose eyes resemble those of afawn, tormented with grief, emacitated, with a bare ground as her bed and suffering here on myaccount."""
6-42-9,"Reflecting on Seetha being troubled, the virtuous Rama speedily issued a command tothe monkeys to destroy the enemies forthwith."
6-42-10,"Hearing those words of Rama, who was unwearied in action, the monkeys vying with oneanother filled the air with their roaring resembling those of lion."
6-42-11,"We shall tear asunder this Lanka with mountain-peaks or with fists alone. - thusresolved all the monkey- generals."
6-42-12,"Lifting up mountain peaks and huge rocks and plucking up various kinds of trees, themonkey-generals stood prepared (for the attack)."
6-42-13,"In order to fulfill Rama's cherished desire, those troops, forming themselves intocolumns, began to scale the heights of Lanka, while Ravana stood gazing."
6-42-14,"Those monkeys, of golden hue with coppery countenance, fighting with Sala trees andmountain-peaks, marched ahead towards the city of Lanka, ready as they were to lay down their livesin Rama's service."

6-45-16,"Pierced in their vital parts, exhausted, and covered all over with heads of arrows, those two mighty and courageous archers fell to the earth, they who were the lords of the earth, shaking violently like a pair of flag-staffs in honour of Indra the Lord celestials and freed from their raised of chords."
6-45-17,"Those warriors, Rama and Lakshmana, lying on that heroes&#39; bed (on the battle-ground), bathed in blood, all their limbs bristling with arrows and extremely injured, felt distressed."
6-45-18,"There was not a finger&#39;s breadth on their bodies form the tips of their fingers to the end of their feet that was not lacerated, implanted and pierced by those arrows."
6-45-19,"Struck down by that ferocious demon, who was able to change his shape at will, the hot blood gushed forth from both Rama and Lashmana, as water from a spring."
6-45-20,"Rama fell first, his vital parts pierced by arrows of the wrathful Indrajit, who had formerly vanquished Indra the Lord of celestials."
6-45-21,"Indrajit pierced Rama by arrows with golden shafts, with sharp points, which had downward movement, which go fast, Narchas, Demi-narachas, Bhallas (with wide tips), Anjalis, Vatsa dantas, Simha dantas and those shafts like unto razors."
6-45-22,"Throwing asunder his bow bent at three places, adorned with gold, with its string loosened away and detached from the hold of his fist, Rama lied down on the battle-ground."
6-45-23,"Seeing Rama the excellent man fallen, at a distance of an arrows range, Lakshman became hopeless about his own life."
6-45-24,"Seeing his elder brother Rama, with his eyes resembling lotus-leaves, having fallen on the ground, wounded as he was by a net work of arrows, Lakshmana felt sad."
6-45-25,"Beholding that Rama, the monkeys too were in great grief and wept terribly, with their eyes filled in tears, being afflicted as they were by sorrow."
6-45-26,"Those monkeys with Hanuman in first place gathered at a place and stood surrounding Rama and Lakshmana, who wee bound by a net work of arrows and lying down on the battle ground. They were disturbed and afflicted sorrow."
6-46-1,"Thereafter, surveying the earth and the sky, the monkeys beheld the brothers Ramaand Lakshmana, covered with arrows."
6-46-2,"Then, along with Sugreeva, Vibhishana came to that place, after Indrajit finishedhis work and retired; even as Indra* would, after raining."
6-46-3,"Nila, Dvivida, Mainda, Sushena, kumuda, Angada along with Hanuman forthwith began togrieve for Rama and Lakshmana."
6-46-4,"Breathing but faintly, bathed in blood; riddled with innumerable arrows, motionlessand lying inactive, they lay stretched on a bed of arrows, sighing like serpants, helpless, havinglittle prowess, their limbs smeared with a stream of blood, resembling two golden standards, andlying on heroes' couch, those warriors with tardy movement of their limbs, were surrounded by theirmonkey-leaders, whose eyes were suffused with tears. Seeing the two Raghavas, pierced by amultitude of arrows, all the monkeys along with Vibhishana became perturbed."
6-46-5,"The monkeys surveyed all the quarters in the sky, without being able to discoverIndrajit (the son of Ravana), who was veiled by his magic powers in the fight."
6-46-6,"Vibhishana, beholding by his magic arts, saw that nephew, standing nearby, dulyhidden by his occult power."
6-46-7,"Althought that warrior who had no peer in the field and who had unique exploits, hadmade himself invisible by virtue of the boon he had received, he was recognized by Vibhishana, whowas full of energy, glory and prowess."
6-46-8,"Contemplating his own feat, Indrajit gazed on those two warriors, stretched on theearth and in excess of joy, wishing to share it with all the demons, said."
6-46-9,"The exceedingly strong brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the killers of Khara andDushana have been killed by my arrows."
6-46-10,"Even were they aided by the gods and demons with the host of sages, these twobrothers would never be able to release themselves from those arrows that paralyse them."
6-46-11,"This non- sensical pest, which was wearing away the very roots of us all, on whoseaccount, the three watches of the night slipped past my father, who is unable even to touch hiscouch with his limbs, who remains absorbed in thought and stricken with grief and because of whom,the entire city of Lanka remains agitated, like a river during the rains, has ban destroyed byme."
6-46-12,"As clouds are useless in the autumn, so are all the exploits of Rama, Lakshmana andall the monkeys."
6-46-13,"Thus speaking to all those demons, Indrajit the son of Ravana (by his arrows0 struckthe monkey chief."
6-46-14,"Striking Nila with nine arrows, Indrajit the destroyer of foes tormented Mainda andDvivida with three superb arrows on each."
6-46-15,"Indrajit the wielder of a great bow smacked the chest-region of Jambavan with anarrow and released ten arrows towards Hanuman, the swift monkey."
6-46-16,"Indrajit the son of Ravana of great swiftness, struck both Gavaksha and Sharabha ofunbounded valour with two arrows on each of them, in that battle."
6-46-17,"Thereafter, Indrajit the son of Ravana swiftly with his various arrows, struckGavaksha (the ruler of golangulas) and then Angada the son of Vali too."
6-46-18,"Indrajit, that strong and highly courageous demons, pierced those jewels among themonkeys there with his arrows which resembled flames of fire and began to shout in triumph."
6-46-19,"Tormenting them with a multitude of arrows and frightening the monkeys, the mightyarmed Indrajit heartily laughed and spoke (as follows)."
6-46-20,"O, demons! At the forefront of the army, behold those two brothers (Rama andLakshmana) bound together by me by a terrible net work of my arrows."
6-46-21,"All those demons, the treacherous fighters on their part, after hearing the words ofIndrajit, were seized with a great wonder and were overjoyed."
6-46-22,"All of them cheered Indrajit unanimously with a roar like unto thunder, crying ""Ramais dead""."
6-46-23,"Seeing the two brothers - Rama and Lakshmana lying motionless and breathless on thefloor, Indrajit thought they were dead."
6-46-24,"Indrajit, full of joy and victorious in conflict, returned to Lanka, spreadinghappiness among the demons."
6-46-25,"Seeing Rama and Lakshmana riddle with arrows and pierced in every limb and bone oftheir bodies, a great fear had taken possession of Sugreeva."
6-46-26,"Vibhishana then spoke to that Sugreeva, who was frightened, whose eyes were filledwith tears, looking helpless and whose eyes were agitated in grief."
6-46-27,"Have no fear, O Sugreeva! Stay this rush of tears. Wars are like this. Victory isnot certain."
6-46-28,"O, warrior! If a remnance of luck is there with us, the highly-souled and theexceedingly strong Rama and Lakshmana will drive off this loss of consciousness."
6-46-29,"O, Sugreeva! Be courageous and bring about courage in me, having no protector. Forthose who are devoted to truth and righteousness, there is no fear of death."
6-46-30,"Thus speaking, Vibhishana then wiped the charming eyes of Sugreeva with his handmoistened in water."
6-46-31,"Then, the pious minded Vibhishana took water, enchanted it with an incantation andwiped the eyes of Sugreeva."
6-46-32,"Having dried the face of the wise Sugreeva Vibhishana spoke the following words fullof good sense and comfort."
6-46-33,"O, Sugreeva the king of monkeys! This is not the time to cling to despondency. Atthis hour, even too much attachment leads to death."
6-46-34,"Therefore, abandoning your despair, which ruins all actions, focus now on how bestto serve the troops which have Rama going before them."
6-46-35,"Or else, let Rama be protected till he regains consciousness. Having regainedconsciousness, Rama and Lakshmana can indeed drive away the fear of both of us."
6-46-36,"This is nothing to Rama nor Rama is going to die. The bodily splendour, which isdifficult to be found in those whose longevity of life has run out; is not abandoning him."
6-46-37,"Therefore console yourself and call on your prowess, till I restore confidence inthe entire ranks."
6-46-38,"O, the foremost of monkeys! These monkeys, having their eyes dilated due to fear,are signaling some words into each other's ear, terrified as they were."
6-46-39,"Let the monkeys cast off their fear, even as one would discard a used garland, onseeing me running about to activate the troops."
6-46-40,"Having emboldened Sugreeva, Vibhishana the foremost of demons once again reassuredthat army of monkeys, who were pushing away."
6-46-41,"Indrajit, the great conjurer, surrounded by all his forces, re-entered the city ofLanka."
6-46-42,"Approaching Ravana there and saluting with joined palms, Indrajit informed hisfather in pleasing words that both Rama and Lakshmana had been slain."
6-46-43,"Hearing in the midst of demons, the news that both the enemies having been killed,Ravana forthwith sprang on his feet in joy and embraced his son."
6-46-44,"Smelling on his head, Ravana delighted at heard, made enquiries in the matter.Indrajit reported the matter as it happened, to his enquiring father, as to how both Rama andLakshmana were made motion-less and luster-less by entwining them with arrows."
6-46-45,"Hearing the words of Indrajit the great charioteer, Ravana with his heart filledwith a gush of joy, relinquished his anguish, caused on account of Rama and applauded his son withpleasing words."
6-47-1,"Indrajit, the son of Ravana having returned to Lanka, his purpose accomplished, theleading monkeys surrounded Rama in order to watch over him."
6-47-2,"Hanuman, Angada, Nila, Sushena, Kumuda, Nala, Gaja, Gavaksha, Panasa, Sanuprasthaand the mighty Jambavan with Sunda, Rambha, Shatabali and Prithu all these monkeys, armed withtrees, reorganized their ranks, stood alert, surveyed the quarters of the sky up and down and onevery side and, even if a grass stirred, they exclaimed, ""It is a demon!"""
6-47-3,"Ravana, meanwhile, full of joy, dismissed his son Indrajit and thereafter summonedthe female demons who guarded Seetha."
6-47-4,"Following his orders, the female-demons along with Trijata appeared before him.Then, the rejoiced Ravana said to them as follows:"
6-47-5,"Tell Seetha that Rama and Lakshmana have been killed by Indrajit. Take her inPushpaka the aeroplane and show her Rama and Lakshman who were killed in battle."
6-47-6,"Her husband, the one depending on whom rendered her so proud that she refused to beunited with me, lies there killed with his brother in the battle-front."
6-47-7,"From now on, free from anxiety, grief and expectation of reunion, Seetha theprincess of Mithila kingdom, adorned in all her jewels, will submit herself to me."
6-47-8,"Beholding Rama and Lakshmana fallen under the sway of death on the battle-fieldtoday, finding no other haven and hoping for nothing else, the large-eyed Seetha will voluntarilyseek refuge with me!"
6-47-9,"Hearing these words of the cruel Ravana, they all replied, ""Be it so"" and went towhere the Pushpaka chariot was."
6-47-10,"Thereafter, the female-demons brought the aerial car, Pushpaka as per theinstructions of Ravana and carried it nearer to Seetha who was staying in Ashoka-grove."
6-47-11,"The female-demons brought Seetha who was afflicted with grief for her husband andmade her to ascend Pushpaka-plane."
6-47-12,"The female-demons along with Trijata made Seetha to ascend Pushpaka-plane andproceeded to show her Rama and Lakshmana."
6-47-13,"Ravana the king of demons, thrilled with rapture, caused Lanka to be garlanded withflags and banners and arranged a proclamation to be made in Lanka announcing that Rama andLakshmana had been slain by Indrajit in battle."
6-47-14,"Seetha along with Trijata, transported by that plane, saw all the monkey-troops whohad been slain."
6-47-15,"Seetha saw the demons who were delighted at heart and monkeys disturbed with grief,standing round Rama and Lakshmana."
6-47-16,"Then, Seetha beheld those two warriors Rama and Lakshmana lying unconscious on theground on a bed of arrows, their limbs pierced with arrows, riddled with weapons, their armourshattered, their bows cast aside at a distance and their entire body transfixed by darts."
6-47-17,"On seeing those two brothers, who were filled with valour, having lotus-eyes, theexcellent of men, lying streteched on a bed of arrows there in that wretched plight like the twosons of the fire-god (Shkha and Vishakha) lying on a bed of reeds, Seetha wailed piteously,stricken as she was with a great agony."
6-47-18,"The dark-eyed Seetha the daughter of Janaka with her faultless limbs, beholding herlord and Lakshmana lying in the dust, burst into sobs."
6-47-19,"Witnessing those brothers, the prominent sons of god, Seetha afflicted with tearfulsorrow, believing their death, spoke with grief the following words."
6-48-1,"Seeing her husband and the mighty Lakshmana having been killed, Seetha was very muchemaiated through grief and lamented pitiably (as follows):"
6-48-2,"The sooth sayers, reading the marks and signs on my body, prophesized that I shallbear sons and never be widowed. Now that Rama has been slain, their words have proved to beuntrue."
6-48-3,"Since Rama is slian, all those astrologers, who predicted that I shold be thecompanio of a sattra sacrifice and the consort of the performer of great sacrifices, now haveproved to be utteres of falsehood."
6-48-4,"Now that Rama has been slain, all those sooth-sayers who predicted that I should behonoured by my husband as well as the wives of warriors and kings, are proved to be liars."
6-48-5,"Now that Rama has been slain, all those astrologers among the wise brahmins. Whoopenly foretold that I should remain happy with my husband are proved to have spoken falsely!"
6-48-6,"Yet I bear the marks of lotus on my soles by virtue of which high-born women areconsecrated on an imperial throne with their husbands and lords."
6-48-7,"I do not find those marks of ill-fortune which betoken widowhood in women who areill-starred and as I examine, all the auspicious signs appear to be rendered void for me."
6-48-8,"Those marks of the lotus said to be good angury for women by wise men, have becomemeaningless, now that Rama is slain."
6-48-9,"My hair is fine, black in colour and smooth. My eye-brows are disunited. My shanksare hair-less and well rounded. My teeth are contiguous, without any gaps between them."
6-48-10,"My temples, eyes, arms, feet, ankles and thights are homogenous andwell-proportioned. My fingers have well-rounded and glossy nails, having a right lenght."
6-48-11,"My breasts are close to each other, fully developed and have depressed nipples. Mynavel is deeply idented. My flanks and bossom are well-formed."
6-48-12,"My complexion has the sheen of a pearl. The hair on my skin are soft. It is said ofme as endowed with auspicious signs, in that I touched the ground with my twelve limbs (viz. theten toes and two soles)."
6-48-13,"Those who interpret the marks of youthful maidens spoke of me that my hands andfeet are rosy, fully provided with marks each resembling a barley corn, devoid of space between myfingers and toes and that my smile is gentle."
6-48-14,"All that was told by brahmins well-versed in sooth-saying, of me that- I should beconsecrated on the imperial throne along with my husband -proved to be in vain."
6-48-15,"Having searched all the resorts of men, received the tidings of my fate, andcrossed the impassable ocean, those two brothers have perishe din the imprint of a cow's hoof ( asmall puddle)."
6-48-16,"Rama and Lakshmana surely knew the use of the arrows of Varuna, Agni, Indra andVayu, as also the Brahmashira weapon."
6-48-17,"By means of magic arts, an invisible foe has slain Rama and Lakshmana, myprotectors, who are equal to Indra in battle and I am now bereft of any support."
6-48-18,"Having reached the range of sight of Rama in a combat, no enemy could return alive,eventhough he were endowed with the swiftness of thought."
6-48-19,"There is no burden too heavy for death to shoulder, as Rama along with his brotherare lying struck down on the battle-field. Fate is inexorable."""
6-48-20,"I do not repent so much for Rama and Lakshmana or for myself or even my mother butfor my unfortunate mother-in-law, Kausalya."
6-48-21,"Kausalya for her part, forever remains absorbed in the thought 'When shall I seeLakshmana and Seetha with Rama returned (to Ayodhya) having completed his vow (of remaining inexile in the forest for fourteen years)?"
6-48-22,"The demoness Trijata spoke to that lamenting Seetha as follows : ""O, the god-likelady! Do not despair. Your husband, Rama is still living."""
6-48-23,"O, godlike lady! I will tell you mighty and cogent reasons, how these two brothersRama and Lakshmana are living."
6-48-24,"The leader having been lost, the faces of the soldiers on the field of battle arenever seized by anger nor are they animated with joy."
6-48-25,"O, Seetha! This aerial car called Pushpaka by name, celestial as it is, would nothave brought you here, if those two heroes have lost their lives."
6-48-26,"An army that sees its valiant commander falll, is bereft of courage and wandersaimlessly about on the battle field, like a ship which has broken its rudder in water."
6-48-27,"This army for its part is neither confused nor perturbed and is guarding Rama andLakshman. I am pointing this out to you on account of my affection for you, O lady given toausterities!"
6-48-28,"You as such, be reassured by these auspicious omens. Behold Rama and Lakshman whoare not dead. I am telling you this, on account of my affection for you."
6-48-29,"O, Seetha! I have not spoken falsehood before, nor shall I ever do so. By yourconduct and natural gaiety, you have found a place in my heart!"
6-48-30,"Even celestials and demons along with Indra cannot vanquish there two heroes inbattle. This is what I have observed and communicated to you."
6-48-31,"O Seetha!; See this, a great marvel !; See how, fallen under those shafts anddeprived of their senses, thier beauty has not deserted them."
6-48-32,"Generally, the faces of those who lost their lives and whose vital power hasvanished, will be appearing with an appalling alteration."
6-48-33,"O, Seetha! Banish your grief, pain and ignorance on account of Rama and Lakshmana.It is impossible, now with the splendour seen in their faces, for Rama and Lakshmana to die."
6-48-34,"Hearing her words, Seetha, the daughter of Mithila kingdom resembling a daughter ofgods, with joined palms exclaimed, ""May it be so."""
6-48-35,"After sending back that aerial car, Pushpaka which was as swift as the thought, thesorrowful Seetha was caused by Trijata to enter Lanka once more."
6-48-36,"Thereafter, Seetha along with Trijata who descended from Pshpaka the aerial car,were caused by the female demons, to enter the Ashoka grove again."
6-48-37,"Entering that Ashoka grove, planted with a multitude of trees, sporting ground ofRavana and recalling the two princes who she had just seen, Seetha gave way to extreme grief."
6-49-1,"Bound by that formidable network of arrows, the two high-souled sons of dasarathalay bathed in blood, breathing like serpants. All those foremost of monkeys who were exceedinglystrong, including Sugreeva, plunged in grief, were standing around those two illustriouswarriors."
6-49-2,"In the meanwhile, the mighty Rama by virtue of his hardihood and native strength,awoke from his swwon, despite the shafts that held him captive."
6-49-3,"Then, beholding his brother, bleeding unconscious, firmly thrown on teh floor, andhis features changed, Rama full of grief lamented thus:"
6-49-4,"Of what use to me is the recovery of Seetha or even life itself, since my brothernow lying, before my eyes, has been struck down in teh fight?"
6-49-5,"It can be possible, if I were to look for her, to find a consort equal to Seetha inthis world of mortals but not a brother, a friend and a comrade in a hostile war, such asLakshmana!"
6-49-6,"If Lakshmana returned to the five elements, he the increaser of Sumitra's joy, Iwill yield up my life-breaths while the monkeys stand looking on."
6-49-7,"What shall I say to my mother, Kausalya or to Kaikeyi? How can I talk to my motherSumitra, sighing for the sight of her son?"
6-49-8,"How shall I console Sumitra, trembling and crying out like an osprey, bereft of herson, if I return to Ayodhya without lakshmana?"
6-49-9,"How shall I tell Shatrughna and the illustrious Bharata when I return withoutLakshmana, who followed to the forest along with me?"
6-49-10,"Alas! I should not be able to endure Sumitra's reproaches. I will leave my bodyhere itself. I do not wish to continue living."
6-49-11,"Woe unto me to my wicked deed and to my lack of nobility. Through my fault,Lakshmana has fallen and lies indeed on a bed of arrows as on who has yielded up his life!"
6-49-12,"O, Lakshmana! You always used to consoe me whenever I was in a great sorrow. You,having lost your life now are not able to allay my sufferings with your words."
6-49-13,"You, who in this battle today, struck down inummerable demons to the earth, arefallen, pierced by darts, like a hero on the self same field."
6-49-14,"Lying on this bed of arrows, bathed in blood, you are piled up; sharajaalaiH= in aheap of arrows; saH= you, as such; bhaasi= look; bhaaskaraH= iva= like the sun; vrajan= settingbehind; astam= the horizon."
6-49-15,"Your vital parts having been pierced with arrows, you are not able even to speaknow. Eventhough you not speaking, your agony is disclosed by the redness of your eyes."
6-49-16,"I shall follow him to the region of Yama, as that illustrious warrior accompaniedme when I retired to the forest."
6-49-17,"He who loved his own kinsfolk and was filled iwth devotion for me, got this stateto which my misdeeds have brought him, wretched that I am!"
6-49-18,"I do not remember to have heard any harsh or hateful words from that valiantLakshmana, even if he is deeply provoked."
6-49-19,"Lakshmana, who was able to loose five hundred arrows in one shot, was surpassingkartavirya himself in the science of archery."
6-49-20,"This Lakshmana, who was accustomed to a rich couch and who by his arrows severe theweapons the mighty Indra the Lord of celestials, is lying slain on the ground."
6-49-21,"Those vain words uttered by me, will ndoubtedly consume me since I have not madeVibhishana the king of demons."
6-49-22,"O, Sugreeva! You ought to return at once from here since knowing that you arebereft of my support, Ravana will overcome you, O king!"
6-49-23,"O, Sugreeva! Recross the sea with your army, keeping Angada in front and with yourfollowers, Nila and Nala."
6-49-24,"I am fully satisfied by the great military exploit, done by Jambavan the king ofBears and the General of the Monkeys, which was impossible to any other in battle."
6-49-25,"A great act was done by Angada, Mainda and Dvivida. A terrible combat was done byKesari and Sampati in the battle-field."
6-49-26,"By Gavaya, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Gaja and other monkeys, who are willing to sacrificetheir lives for me, the battle was carried on."
6-49-27,"O, Sugreeva! It is not possible for mortals to avoid their destiny. O, Sugreeva thetormentat of enemies! Fearing to fail in your duty, you have done all that which a friend and acomrade could do."
6-49-28,"O. foremost of Monkyes! You have accomplished all this due to your friendship. Itake leave of you all; go where it seems best to you!"
6-49-29,"All the tawny eyed monkeys, who heard Rama's lament thus, allowed tears to fall fromtheir eyes."
6-49-30,"Meanwhile, Vibhishana having established order in all the ranks, with mace in hishand, came quickly to Rama."
6-49-31,"Seeing him, who resembled a mass of collyrium, hastening towards them thus, all themonkeys thinking him to be Indrajit the son of Ravana, fled away."
6-50-1,"Meanwhile, Sugreeva the king of Monkeys, possessing a great splendour and a mightypower, enquired saying, ""Why is this army agitated, like a ship driven out of its course inwater?"""
6-50-2,"Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Angada the son of Vali replied, saying ""Do you notsee the high-souled Rama and Lakshmana of the great chariot, those two valiant sons of Dasarathacovered with darts lying all bloody in a bed of arrows?"""
6-50-3,"Thereupon, Sugreeva the Lord of Monkeys said to his son Angada: ""To my mind, thereis some othere cause why the monkeys are bewildereed. There must be some danger ahead."""
6-50-4,"Here, these monkeys are runnng away in all directions, with their eyes distendedwith terror, throwing down their arms and looking dejected."
6-50-5,"They are not ashamed of one another. They are not looking behind than even. Theyare jostling each other and leaping over those who have fallen."
6-50-6,"In the midst of this turmoil, the valiant Vibhishana, wielding a mace in his handcame there and cheered Sugreeva and Rama saying ""Victory to Rama! Victory to Rama!."""
6-50-7,"Observing Vibhishana to be the cause of panic among the monkeys, Sugreeva spoke tothe illustrious Jambavan the king of Bears who stood near (as follows):"
6-50-8,"It is Vibhishana who has come here. On seeing him, the foremost of monkeys seizedwith terror have fled, deeming him to be Indrajit, Ravana's son."
6-50-9,"You reassemble those monkeys immediately, who in fear have scattered in manydirections and inform them that it is Vibhishana who has come!"
6-50-10,"Thus spoken by Sugreeva, Jambavan the king of Bears called the fugitive monkeys backand restored them to confidence."
6-50-11,"Hearing the words of Jambavan the king of Bears, all those monkeys, on perceivingVibhishana, retraced their steps, shaking off their fear."
6-50-12,"Meanwhile, the virtuous Vibhishana, on beholding Rama's body as also of Lakshmana'scovered with arrows, felt distressed."
6-50-13,"Washing their eyes with his hands dipped in water, Vibhishana began to weap, withanguish seizing his heart and lamented, saying:"
6-50-14,"These two powerful and valiant warrriors have been brought tot his state by thedemons, the treacherous combatants."
6-50-15,"The son of my brother, that wicked youth of perverse soul in his demoniac cunningmind, has decived those two honourable fighters."
6-50-16,"These two warriors, Rama and Lakshmana, who were struck badly by arrows and coveredwith blood are lying on the earth, like two porcupines."
6-50-17,"These two lions among men, on whom depended the positon aspired by me, are lyinginsensible, waiting for the dissolution of the body."
6-50-18,"Deprived of the hope now of becoming a king, I am as one dead, eventhoughsurviving; while my rival Ravana sees his vow fulfilled and gets his desires realised."
6-50-19,"Then, Sugreeva the magnanimous King of Monkeys embraced that Vibhishana thuslamenting and spoke the following words:"
6-50-20,"O, knower of what is right! You shall certainly reign over Lanka. Ravana and hisson will not acheive their purpose."
6-50-21,"The injury done to Rama and Lakshmana is not grave. Emerging from their swoon, theywill destroy Ravana with his hordes in battles."
6-50-22,"Consoling and convincing Vibhishana thus, Sugreeva spoke to Sushena, hisfather-in-law, who was on his side (as follows):"
6-50-23,"Taking these two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana with the troops of monkeys who arestrong, you go to Kishkindha, till these two scourgers of their foes have recovered theirconsciousness."
6-50-24,"As for me, I shall slay Ravana with his son and his relatives and bring back Seethaas did Indra the Lord of celestials, the prosperity he had lost."
6-50-25,"Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Sushena replied as followers:  A highly terrificand great was between celestials and demons was perceived by me."""
6-50-26,"By making themselves invisible again and again, the demons skilled in the use ofarrows overcame the celestials despite their skill in bearing arms."
6-50-27,"To those celestials who were wounded, unconscious and almost deprived of life,Brihaspati treated them by the aid of herbs accompanied by his spells of sacred formulas."
6-50-28,"Let the monkeys Sampati, Panasa and others go quickly in speed, to the ocean ofmilk, to bring those herbs."
6-50-29,"These monkeys are conversant with those efficacious mountianous herbs - thecelestial Sanjivakarani and Vishalya, which were created by a God."
6-50-30,"In the bosom of the milky ocean the best of oceans, rise the mountains calledChandra and Drona, where the ambrosia was formerly churned. These two excellent herbs existthere."
6-50-31,"The celestials place dthose two mountain in the vast sea. O, King! Let Hanuman theson of Wind-God go there."
6-50-32,"In the meantime, a great wind arose, accompanied by massed clouds and lightning,whipping up the salty waves in the ocean, causing the mountains to tremble as from anearthquake."
6-50-33,"Large trees on the sand-banks had their branches broken by the mighty stroke ofVata's wings and fell headlong into the briny waters of the ocean."

6-50-40,"Lifting them up both who were like Indra, the highly majestic Garuda the eagleembraced them. Rama also, being pleased, spoke to him (as follows):"
6-50-41,"Now, by your grace, we both have overcome a great disaster created by Indrajit theson of Ravana. We have been made strong as before."
6-50-42,"By meeting you thus, my heart is gladdened in the same manner as I am meetingDasaratha, my fatehr and Aja, my paternal grandfather."
6-50-43,"Who are you, the one endowed with beauty, having blissful garlands and anointments,wearing clean garments and adorned iwth divine ornaments?"

6-50-47,"These serpents, which took their base at, were none other than the sons of Kadruwith their sharp fangs, abundantly filled with poison, transformed into arrows, by the dint ofsorcery by Indrajit the demon."
6-50-48,"O, Rama the knower of righeousness and true to your promise! You, along with yourbrother Lakshmana the annihilator of enemies, indeed are lucky."
6-50-49,"Hearing about this incident, I have hastened all at once, duly cherishing the loveand friendship (for you)."
6-50-50,"You have been released from this quite terrific shackle of arrows. Both of youshould maintain vigilance, all the time."
6-50-51,"All the demons by their very nature are treacherous fighters in battle. For you,the warriors, your pue-mindedness and straight forwardeness are the strengths."
6-50-52,"What Indrajit has done, exemplifies how the demons are always crooked-minded. Forthis reason, you should not trust the demons in battle."
6-50-53,"That mighty Garuda, having spoken thus to Rama then and having affectionatelyembraced him, began to take leave of him."
6-50-54,"O, Rama the knower of piety, affectionate even towards your enemies and my dearfried! I wish to take leave of you. I shall proceed happily."""
6-50-55,"O, hero! You need not be so curious to know the casue of my friendship. You willknow of it, once you have accomplished success in battle."
6-50-56,"When, under the flutter of your arrows, Lanka has been destroyed save for the agedand the children and you have slain Ravana,. your enemy, you will bring back Seetha."
6-50-57,"Having spoken thus, Garuda of swift flight, having beautiful wings, who had justhealed Rama's wounds in the presence of monkeys, having paid obeisance presence of monkeys, havingpaid obeisance to him (by circumambulation) and taken him into his arms, entered the sky with thespeed of the wind."
6-50-58,"Seeing Rama and Lakshmana healed of their wounds, the cheifs of monkeys haowled likeroars of lions and lashed their tails."
6-50-59,"Thereupon, gongs were beaten, drums resounded, and couches were blown amid jumpingin joy of the monkeys as before."
6-50-60,"Some other strong monkeys who use trees as maces in battle, waving their arms anduprooting hundreds and thousands of various trees, stood there, ready for the battle."

6-51-7,"Thus commanded by Ravana, they mounted the rampart very briskly and saw the armylead by the high-souled Sugreeva and also the highly fortunate Rama and Lakshmana who were relievedof the terrific shackle of arrow a and risen up together. All the demons felt desponded on seeingit."
6-51-8,"With their hearts trembling with fear and faces turning pale, all those terrificdemons descended from the rampart and approached Ravana."
6-51-9,"With downcast faces, those demons skilled in speech, faithfully informed Ravana ofthose unpleasant tidings, saying:"
6-51-10,"The two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, whom Indrajit had bound with his benumbingshafts and whose arms he had pinioned, are free from the arrows which paralyzed them and now appearon the field of battle, as two strong elephants who have snapped their fetters."
6-51-11,"Hearing their words, the might Ravana was filled with anxiety and fury. His facebecame pale (and he spoke as follows):"
6-51-12,"If my adversaries, having thus been bound by Indrajit are freed, despite theirinjuries in battle by his formidable arrows which were infallible those rare boons, resemblingserpents, bright as the sun, I perceive my entire army in jeopardy."
6-51-13,"Those very arrows, bright as fire, which in battle have taken the life of myenemies, have now been rendered void indeed!"
6-51-14,"Having spoken thus in furious tones, hissing like a snake, he addressed a demoncalled Dhumraksha who was seated amidst the demons and said."
6-51-15,"You, with a terrific prowess, go quickly with a considerable force of demons andslay Rama, Lakshmana and his monkeys."
6-51-16,"Thus commanded by Ravana, the intelligent Dhumraksha, going past from there, quicklydeparted front her royal palace."

6-51-19,"Those strong demons of terrific form, making sounds with bells hung on their bodies,joyously surrounded Dhumraksha."
6-51-20,"Furnished with every kind of weapon, brandishing spears, hammers, maces, harpoons,sticks, iron cudgels, bars, clubs, javelins, missiles, nooses and axes, those terrible demonssallied forth with the noise of thunder."
6-51-21,"Clad in mail, mounted on chariots that were magnificently dressed with flags anddecorated with bands of pure gold, harnessed to mules of many heads or steeds of exceedingfleetness or elephants in furious rut, some other excellent demons went forth like veritabletigers."
6-51-22,"Dhumraksha, with a mule-like clatter, set out in a celestial chariot to which mulesadorned with gold and heads of deer and lions were hitched."
6-51-23,"That Dhumraksha of mighty prowess, surrounded by demons, set forth amidst mockinglaughter, through the western gate where the army-chief Hanuman was stationed."

6-56-4,"Those arrogant monkeys of terrific ferocity, armed with trees and rocks, dare toaffront me here."
6-56-5,"I wish to kill those andicious monkeys, who are seen herassing all the army ofdemons."
6-56-6,"Thereafter, in his chariot, drawn by fast-moving horses, Akampana the most skillfulof chariot-warriors, with a hail of darts, assailed the monkeys from a distance."
6-56-7,"The monkeys were no longer able to maintain their formation, much less fight in thebattle. all of them were crushed under the shifts of Akampana and took to their heels."
6-56-8,"Seeing those companions, getting under the sway of death pursued by Akampana'sdarts, the mighty Hanuman went to their rescue."
6-56-9,"Seeing Hanuman their great leader, all those valiant and the best of the monkeystogether rallied and grouped themselves boldly round him."
6-56-10,"Observing Hanuman's courage, those excellent monkeys took shelter in hispowerfulness and became powerfulness and became powerful indeed."
6-56-11,"Akampana, like Mahendra the Lord of celestials, assailed a hail of arrows onHanuman, who remained as firm as a rock."
6-56-12,"Heedless of the flood of weapons that fell upon his body, the mighty Hanumanresolved in his mind to slay Akampana."
6-56-13,"Laughing heartily , that Hanuman, the son of Maruta the wind-god and possessing agreat splendour, leapt on the demon, causing the earth to shake as it were."
6-56-14,"As he roared burning with energy, the form of Hanuman became difficult to overpower,like a blazing fire."
6-56-15,"Knowing himself to be bereft of any weapon, Hanuman the excellent monkey, with arage, uplifted a mountain quickly."
6-56-16,"That valiant Hanuman, seizing a very great mountain with one hand and letting up aroar, began to spin it rapidly."
6-56-17,"Thereafter, as formerly in an encounter Indra the Lord of celestials hurled histhunderbolt at Namuchi, Hanuman rushed towards Akampana."
6-56-18,"Beholding that crag flying towards him, Akampana shattered it even from a distanceby means of his great crescent-shaped arrows."
6-56-19,"Seeing that rocky peak shatterd in the air by the demon's arrows and falling inpieces, Hanuman became mad with anger."
6-56-20,"Approaching an Ashwakarna tree as large as a mountain, in the transport of rage thatpossessed him, that Hanuman uprooted it speedily."
6-56-21,"Taking hold of that Ashvakarna tree with large branches, in his great strength,Hanuman with immense delight spinned it, while standing on the ground."
6-56-22,"Then, the highly enraged Hanuman began to run with great strides, breaking down thetrees by his strength and tearing up the earth with his feet."
6-56-23,"Hanuman struck down elephants as also who rode upon them and charioteers with theirchariots and the terrific infantry of demons."
6-56-24,"Seeing that Hanuman, like unto Yama the Destroyer of vital Breaths, full of wratharmed with a tree and taking off lives, the demons took of flight."
6-56-25,"The valiant Akampana, beholding that Hanuman who was enraged and rushing on, sowingterror among his soldiers, was greatly perturbed and set up a mighty shout."
6-56-26,"With fourteen sharp arrows that tore the flesh, that Akampana pierced the highlyvaliant Hanuman."
6-56-27,"Riddled with sharp-pointed shafts, that warrior Hanuman appeared like a mountain onwhich a number of plants shooted up."
6-56-28,"That mighty Hanuman of great strength with a large body shone like a fire withoutsmoke and resembled a blooming Ashoka tree."
6-56-29,"Thereafter, showing a great haste in uprooting another tree, Hanuman struck the headof Akampana the General of demons."
6-56-30,"Struck with a tree by that high-souled and enraged Hanuman, that demon fell down anddied."
6-56-31,"Seeing their leader Akampana lying lifeless on earth, all the demons trembled as thetrees do during an earthquake."
6-56-32,"All those defeated warriors, throwing their arms, escaped in the direction of Lanka,terrified, pursued by those monkeys."
6-56-33,"Their hair loosened, bewildered, their pride broken by defeat, their limbs drippingwith sweat, those demons fled, blowing out their breaths."
6-56-34,"Mad with fear, looking back again and again and crushing each other in haste, theyentered the city."
6-56-35,"When those demons had entered Lanka, all the mighty monkeys approached Hanuman andpaid homage to him."
6-56-36,"That Hanuman, of noble nature honoured all those delighted monkeys, in accord withtheir rank and the occasion."
6-56-37,"The triumphant monkeys shouted in accord with their nighty and once again draggedthe demons who were still alive there on the battle-field."
6-56-38,"That great monkey, born of Maruta having encountered and killed the demons, enjoyedthe same renown as Vishnu when he overcame the mighty and terrific demon of immense powerdestroying his enemies in the forefront of the battle."
6-56-39,"Then, the troops of deities along with Rama himself, the exceedingly strongLakshmana, Sugreeva and other monkeys and the mighty Vibhishana paid homage to Hanuman."
6-57-1,"Hearing of Akampana's killing, Ravana the Lord of demons, with a little depressedface, was enraged and looked towards his ministers."
6-57-2,"Having reflected awhile and deliberated with his ministers, Ravana the king ofDemons then passed that forenoon in inspecting his defenses in the City of Lanka."
6-57-3,"The king Ravana saw that City, guarded by groups of demons, filled with innumerabletroops and decorated with banners and flags."
6-57-4,"Seeing Lanka besieged, Ravana the Lord of Demons spoke as follows to Prahasta whowas skilled in war-fare and who wished well of him even at a critical time."
6-57-5,"O, Prahasta the proficient in war-free! I do not see any other deliverance than abattle for this city, which is besieged suddenly and being devastated."
6-57-6,"Either myself or Kumbhakarna or yourself my army-chief or Indrajit or Nikumbha andnone else could undertake such a task!"
6-57-7,"For that reason, taking a company of warriors, you quickly place yourself in theirmidst and set forth in order to triumph over all those monkeys."
6-57-8,"Unsettled in no time on knowing your decision to enter the battle-field, the armyof monkeys will run away on hearing the raring sound of the leaders of demons."
6-57-9,"The monkeys are unsteady, mis-behaved and fickle-minded. They do not tolerate yoursound, as elephants the lion's roar."
6-57-10,"O, Prahasta! As that army takes to its heels, Rama along with Lakshmana beingsupportless, will fall into your power though unwillingly."
6-57-11,"A skeptical misfortune is preferable to one that is certain! Whether it isunpleasing to hear or not, say what you consider as an advantage to us."
6-57-12,"Hearing the words of Ravana, Prahasta the Army-General spoke the following words toRavana, like Ushana the preceptor of demons would speak to Bali, the king of demons."
6-57-13,"O, king! Formerly, we deliberated this matter with our wise ministers and, afterhaving a good dialogue with each other, a disagreement arose between us."""
6-57-14,"To return Seetha was what I considered preferable. Not to do so meant war; weforesaw this."
6-57-15,"I have ever been honoured by you at appropriate times by gifts, felicitations andnice words. When the opportunity arises, is it not for me to render you a service?"
6-57-16,"Neither wives nor sons nor riches are going to be spared by me. See you me,intending to sacrifice my life for your sake in the battle."
6-57-17,"Having spoken thus to Lord Ravana, the General Prahasta said to his leading officerswho stood before him as follows:"
6-57-18,"Gather a large army of demons together for me. Today, the flesh-eating birds andbeasts shall feed on the enemy that I strike down on the battle-field with my swift arrows."
6-57-19,"Hearing that command of Prahasta, the mighty leaders of the army assembled theforces in the abode of that demon."
6-57-20,"Within a short while, that City of Lanka was filled with those terrificdemon-warriors, resembling elephants and wielding various types of weaponry."
6-57-21,"While some demons propitiated the fire-god with their offerings and paid homage toBrahmanas, a fragrant freeze bearing the scent of clarified butter, began to blow."
6-57-22,"Then, the demons who were ready for the battle, delightedly wore garlands ofdifferent shapes, consecrated by certain Mantras (sacred formulas)."
6-57-23,"Thereafter, armed with bows and armours, the demons with their eyes turned towardstheir king Ravana, marched at a brisk pace and ranged themselves round Prahasta."
6-57-24,"Then, Prahasta who got ready with his weapons and armour, after bidding obeisance tothe king and striking a terrible kettle-drum, mounted his chariot, which was kept ready, yoked toan extremely swift horses, well controlled by a charioteer, emanating a noise resembling that of alarge cloud, actually shining like moon-light, inviolable with a flag bearing an ensign of snake,with a good collision-guard, with nice wheels and decorated with a net of pure gold smiling as itwere in its magnificence."
6-57-25,"Then, Prahasta the one who was commanded by Ravana, ascended his chariot and set outfrom Lanka soon along with a huge army."
6-57-26,"While Prahasta the general sallied forth, the sound of a kettle-drum, the resonanceof musical instruments and the sound of conches were heard, as though filling the earth like theroar of a cloud."
6-57-27,"The demons with terrific forms and bulky bodies, shouting with dreadful voices, wentin front, as forerunners of Prahasta."
6-57-28,"Narantaka, Kumbhahanu, Mahanada and Samunnata, attendants of Prahasta sallied forth,surrounding him on all sides."
6-57-29,"He emerged from the eastern gate in the midst of an immense, formidable and orderlyarranged army, resembling a herd of elephants."
6-57-30,"In the centre of that army, vast as the sea, that Prahasta in his fury, came forthappearing like Death at the end of the world."
6-57-31,"The uproar that arose on his setting forth with his demons raising the war-criesdrew sinister answering calls from all creatures in Lanka."
6-57-32,"In a cloudless sky, birds of prey eating flesh and blood, flew in circles from leftto right towards the chariot."
6-57-33,"Fearful jackals vomited forth fire and flames, howling repeatedly. A meteor fellfrom the sky and the wind blew harshly."
6-57-34,"The plants, in opposition to each other, lost their brilliance. The clouds, withtheir raucous sound, showered blood on Prahasta's chariot and dampened those who were walking infront of it."
6-57-35,"A vulture facing the south alighted on the top of the standard, croaking towardsboth of its sides and deprived the demon of his entire lustre."
6-57-36,"The goad fell several times then from the hand of the charioteer, himself a Suta(the son of a Kshatriya by a Brahamana woman) eventhough skilled in controlling the horses, as heentered the battle-field."
6-57-37,"That rarely splendour which clothed Prahasta at the time of his exit vanished in aninstant and horses stumbled on the even ground."
6-57-38,"Beholding that Prahasta, renowned for his excellences and martial valour; as headvanced to give battle, the army of monkeys went forward to attack him."
6-57-39,"Thereafter, an exceedingly tumultuous clamour arose among the monkeys as they toreup the trees and seized hold of huge rocks."
6-57-40,"Both the armies of the yelling demons and the roaring monkeys were delighted,impetuous and powerful with impatience to slay each other and challenging each other with greatshouts."
6-57-41,"Thereafter, the evil-minded Prahasta sallied forth for victory towards the army ofSugreeva, whom in his folly, imagined he would destroy, with an accelerated speed as a grass-hopperrushes towards a flame."
6-58-1,"Seeing Prahasta setting out with a martial ardour, Rama the conqueror of enemies,smiling, spoke to Vibhishana as follows:"
6-58-2,"Who is he with a very huge body, coming with a great speed along with a large army?O, the mighty armed! Tell me about this strong demon."
6-58-3,"Hearing Rama's words, Vibhishana replied as follows ""He is guarded by two-thirds ofthe army of Lanka. He is a demon of prowess, skilled in the use of mystic weapons and valiant. Heis the demon named Prahasta, the Army general of Ravana."""
6-58-4,"That huge and powerful army of monkeys, who began to emit cries of defiance withfury, thereupon saw the terrible Prahasta of formidable exploits coming forth towards them."
6-58-5,"Swords, lances, daggers, darts, spears, clubs, maces bars, barbed missiles, variouskinds of axes and different bows glittered in the hands of demons, who were running up towards themonkeys and seeking victory."
6-58-6,"The monkeys who were burning to fight took hold of trees in flower, rocks and loftyand thick stones."
6-58-7,"As they approached each other, a very great battle arose between those combatantswho showered down a hail of arrows and a bombardment of stones."
6-58-8,"In that battle, many of the demons killed several excellent monkeys and severalmonkeys killed many of the demons."
6-58-9,"Some monkeys were smashed by spears and some others by finer weapons. Some werestruck by iron bars and some others were slit by axes."
6-58-10,"Yet again, some fell breathlessly on the ground and some were destroyed by thearrows aimed at them with their hearts splits asunder."
6-58-11,"Cut into two with the strokes of swords by those powerful demons, some monkeys,trembling, fell on the earth, their sides torn open."
6-58-12,"Even the flock of demons on all sides were crushed on to the earth by the furiousmonkeys with tree and mountain-peaks."
6-58-13,"Having been administered thundering slaps with their hands and terrific blows withtheir fists, the faces and eyes of demons were were lacerated. The demons vomited plenty of bloodfrom their months."
6-58-14,"A tumultuous clamour arose among monkeys and demons, as cries of pain and leonineroars were bellowed."
6-58-15,"The monkeys and the demons with anger, following the path of heroes, with theircruel and hostile eyes, accomplished their deeds with great courage."
6-58-16,"Narantaka Kumbhahanu, Mahanada and Samunnata all these companions of Prahasta killedthe monkeys."
6-58-17,"Dvivida, with a mountain-peak, struck down Narantaka, the one among them who wasrushing upon quickly and killing the monkeys."
6-58-18,"The ape Durmukha on his part, with a ready hand, uprooted a very large tree andcrushed the demon Samunnata."
6-58-19,"The energetic Jambavan with a great fury seized a huge rock and threw it on thechest-region of Mahanada."
6-58-20,"Then, the valiant Kumbhahanu there in the battle, having attacked the General Tara,who was armed with a huge tree, received a blow immediately cost him his life."
6-58-21,"Not tolerating the aforesaid act, Prahasta having occupied his chariot with bow inhand, caused a terrible havoc among the monkeys."
6-58-22,"Then, with the rapid movement of both the armies, there arose of clamour resemblingthe roar of an unfathomable and tempestuous ocean in a time of dissolution."
6-58-23,"The demon Prahasta, who was hard to be subdued in battle, with full of anger,tormented the monkeys by an immense avalanche of arrows in that great combat."
6-58-24,"By the frightening corpses of monkeys and demons, appearing like hideous mountains,a very extensive area of the ground is covered."
6-58-25,"That ground, covered by the stream of blood, shone as in the month of spring whenoverspread fully with the bloossoming crimson-coloured Palasa flowers."
6-58-26,"With the heaps of warriors for its banks the broken weapons its trees, the torrentsof blood its huge waves, death appeared like an ocean receiving its floods, livers and spleens itsmire, entrails its moss, severed heads and trunks the fish, and morsels of flesh the grass, theinnumerable vultures its lovely swans, herons its geese, covered as it was with fat for the foam,the tumult the sound of its waters, the battle field resembled a river, incapable of being crossedby cowards, visited by water-fowls at the end of the rainy season, those demons and the foremost ofthe monkeys crossed over that impassable river, as elephants lead their herds across a lake thatthe lotuses have covered with pollen."
6-58-27,"Then, Nila saw Prahasta who was employing a multitude of arrows sitting in thechariot and annihilating the monkeys swiftly."
6-58-28,"Seeing Nila who was running towards him in the battle-field, as a rocking wind inthe sky rushes towards a large massive clouds, Prahasta the Army general attacked Nila himself withhis chariot having the sun's colour."
6-58-29,"That Prahasta the Army General, who was excellent among the wielders of bow, drewthe bow-string and hurled the arrows towards Nila in that great battle."
6-58-30,"Those arrows with a great speed resembling furious snakes employed by Prahastaproceeded towards Nila, pierced him and fell on the ground."
6-58-31,"That great ape of prowess Nila, who was struck by sharp arrows resembling flames,uprooted a tree and thumped it on the descending Prahasta who was most difficult to beassaulted."
6-58-32,"Being unable to restrain the series of arrows hurled at him by that evil-mindeddemon, nila received them with closed eyes."
6-58-33,"Like a bull standing under a sudden autumnal down-pour, so under that intolerableand sudden rain of darts released by Prahasta, Nila endured with closed eyes though it was scarceto be endured."
6-58-34,"The exceedingly strong and the great Nila, enraged over the volley of darts, killedPrahasta's horses by hurling a huge Sala tree on them."
6-58-35,"Thereafter the greatly enraged Nila quickly broke the bow of Prahasta theevil-minded demon and shouted again and again."
6-58-36,"Deprived of his bow, Prahasta the leader of the army, seizing a formidable mace,leapt down from the chariot."
6-58-37,"Those two army-chiefs, who were courageous and in whom enmity had sprung up, withtheir limbs covered with blood, wee standing like two elephants in rut."
6-58-38,"Lion and tiger in gait, lion and tiger in gestures, those two warriors tore eachother with their shap teeth. Vanquishers of other heroes and intrepid combatants, both of them,thirsting for fame, resembled Vritra and Indra."
6-58-39,"Then, that Prahasta exerting himself well struck Nila on his forehead with a maceand blood oozed from his forehead."
6-58-40,"Whereupon, that great ape, his limbs smeared with blood, seized a huge tree andstruck Prahasta full in his chest with fury."
6-58-41,"Ignoring that blow, he seized a huge mace and ran in strength towards Nila thestrong monkey."
6-58-42,"Seeing Prahasta of terrible velocity briskly rushing towards him, Nila the greatmonkey took a huge rock swiftly."
6-58-43,"Nila quickly hurled that rock on the head of Prahasta who was longing for war andfighting with a mace in the battle."
6-58-44,"Then, that huge and terrific rock hurled by Nila the leader of the monkeys brokePrahasa's head into myriad pieces."
6-58-45,"That Prahasta who lost his breath, was disfigured and dead, bereft of his senses andat once fell on the ground like a tree cut up by the root."
6-58-46,"A lot of blood oozed from his broken head. From his body two, blood streamed forthlike a cascade from a mountain."
6-58-47,"Thier leader having been slain by Nila that unshakable and large army of demons,becoming disconsolated, withdrew to Lanka."
6-58-48,"Thier chief of Army having been killed, those demons could not continue to standfirmy there, any more than water on reaching a breached bridge."
6-58-49,"That Prahasta the chief of Army having been slain, those demons dumb dispirited andinactive, regained the abode of their king. They became unconscious as it were plunged in an oceanof burning grief."
6-58-50,"The triumphant Nila, however, was honoured by Rama and Lakshmana for his task wellaccomplished and experienced supreme joy."
6-59-1,"While Prahasta the Army chief of demons was slain in the battle by Nila the foremostamong the monkeys, Ravana's army possessing terrible arms took to flight with the speed of atide."
6-59-2,"The demons went and told Ravana that Prahasta the Army chief had been killed by Nilathe son of Fire-god. Hearing those words of the demons, Ravana was possessed of anger."
6-59-3,"Hearing that Prahasta had perished in the fight, Ravana was afflicted with anger andhis heart filled with grief and he addressed the foremost of his leaders as Indra the Lord ofcelestials to the leaders of the celestial troops (as follows):"
6-59-4,"That enemy is not to be despised; under whose blows the destroyer of Indra's hostthe leader of my army with his followers and elephants fell."
6-59-5,"I myself shall go to that wonderful battle-front without hesitation in order todestroy the enemies and to gain victory."
6-59-6,"As a forest is consumed by blazing fires, so shall I scorch that army of monkeysnow along with Lakshmana and Rama with a multitude of arrows. Today, I shall satiate the earth withthe blood of the monkeys."
6-59-7,"Speaking thus, Ravana the enemy of the Lord of celestials ascended his chariot whichshone like a flame and was yoked to a team of excellent horses with its brilliance of an effulgentbody."
6-59-8,"Ravana the best among the kings of demons sallied forth with the sound of couches,kettle-drums, cymbals, clapping of hands and leonine roars and well-acclaimed by agreeableencomiums."
6-59-9,"That Ravana along with the flesh-eating demons whose forms resembled mountains andclouds and whose glances flashed like torches shone like Rudra the Lord of Immortals surrounded bygenii."
6-59-10,"Ravana who was endowed with extraordinary energy, issuing all at once from the city,observed a ferocious army of monkeys with trees and rocks in their hands, ready for combat androaring like a vast ocean and a mass of thunder-clouds."
6-59-11,"Seeing that army of demons who were excessively furious, Rama whose arms resembledgreat serpents, accompanied by his forces and having great fortune, spoke to Vibhishana the bestamong the wielders of weapons (as follows):"
6-59-12,"Who is in command of this army, furnished with every kind of standard, banner andcanopy, armed with javelins, swords, stakes and other weapons and missiles and composed ofimperturbable soldiers and elephants as high as the Mahendra Mountain?"
6-59-13,"Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana the equal of Indra in valour, then narrated toRama about the choicest army of the foremost among demons of the highest peculiarity (asfollows):"
6-59-14,"O Prince! That hero who has a face with a coppery hue resembling a newly risingsun, coming on the back of an elephant causing its head to sway, know him to be Akampana."
6-59-15,"He who, standing in his chariot, brandish his bow which has a splendour of Indra'sbow, whose standard bears the image of a lion, and who shines like unto an elephant with itsterrible curved tusks, he is Indrajit who is renowned for the boons he had received fromBrahma."
6-59-16,"He who, the archer like unto the Vindhya, Asta or Mahendra Mountains, standing inhis chariot, a mighty warrior, of superior strength, who wields a bow of unequalled size and havingan exceedingly grown body, he is called Atikaya."
6-59-17,"He who, with tawny eyes resembling the dawn, riding an elephant with its bellsjangling, who is shouting aloud, he is that strong demon of the highest peculiarity is calledMahodara."
6-59-18,"He who, ascending the brilliantly caparisoned horse raising high a gleamingjavelin, possesses a velocity of a well-directed thunder-bolt and resembles a mass of eveningclouds and a mountain, he is Pishacha."
6-59-19,"He who, seizing a sharp spike with a possesses the velocity of a well-directedthunder bolt and comes mounting on an excellent bull which shines like a moon, he is theillustrious Trishiras."
6-59-20,"The other resembling a thunder-bolt, of large and well-developed chest, who has anattentive mind, has the King of Snakes as his standard, who is moving and twanging his bow, he isKumbha."
6-59-21,"He who, holding a mace decorated with gold and diamonds, which are radiant (asfire) and also smoky (studded with sapphires), who advances as a standard bearer tot he army ofdemons, he is Nikumbha of Prodigious exploits."
6-59-22,"He who, mounted in a chariot, adorned with flags, gleaming like a glowing blazer,who is furnished with bows swords and a multitude of arrows, he is Narantaka who shines brightlyover there and who, in combat, fights with mountain-tops."
6-59-23,"He who, surrounded by ghosts of dreadful form of rolling eyes, with heads oftigers, buffalo mighty elephants, deer and horses, under an excellent white canopy with slenderribs and shining like a moon, he who is the humbler of the gods themselves, shining like unto Rudraamidst the genii, is the suzerain Lord of Demons there."
6-59-24,"Ravana, decked with a diadem, who has brought Indra the Lord of celestials andVaivasvata the Lord of Death low, is shining like the sun. His countenance is graced by ear-rings.His formidable stature equals the Vindhya the Lord of Mountains."
6-59-25,"Then, Rama the annihilator of enemies, answered Vibhishana and said ""Alas! Whatglory, what majesty is Ravana's the Lord of Demons!"
6-59-26,"Ravana is beaming like the sun with his rays difficult to be gazed, neither can theeye rest on him such is the binding strength of his magnificence!"
6-59-27,"The body of celestial or demonical heroes may not be so radiant in this manner asthis body of the king of demons."
6-59-28,"All the warriors of the suzerain Ravana are as high as hills. All fight withmountains. All wield fiery weapons."
6-59-29,"Amidst the fiery ghosts of terrible aspect, this king of demons shines like Yamathe Lord of Death surrounded by blazing genii endowed with hideous forms."
6-59-30,"By good luck, that wretch comes today within my range of sight! Today, I shallexpunge my wrath, born of Seetha's abduction!"
6-59-31,"Having spoken thus, the valiant Rama who was accompanied by Lakshmana, took up hisbow and then standing erect, drew out an excellent arrow."
6-59-32,"Thereafter, that powerful Ravana spoke to those exceedingly strong demons asfollows: ""Take up your positions unfalteringly and happily at the gates and principal exits, theoutposts and fortifications."""
6-59-33,"Learning of my presence along with you here, taking this to be a weak point andstorming this desolate city which is otherwise difficult to be overpowered, the monkeys when unitedmay destroy it by surprise."
6-59-34,"Having dismissed those counsellors and as the demons departed as ordered, Ravanathereafter began to split under the waters of the sea of monkeys, in the same way as a giganticfish would rend the entire expanse of the sea."
6-59-35,"Seeing Ravana with his radiant bow, in the battle, Sugreeva the Lord of Monkeystearing up a huge mountain-top, ran towards that king of demons."
6-59-36,"Seizing a mountain-top with its many trees and ridges, Sugreeva hurled it on Ravanathe demon. Seeing that mountain-top coming towards him, Ravana quickly broke it asunder with hisarrows with golden shafts."
6-59-37,"While that mountain-top with its well-developed ridges and excellent trees was rentasunder and fell on the earth, Ravana like unto another Yama the Lord of Death, loosed an arrowresembling a great serpent."
6-59-38,"The enraged Ravana, taking that arrow with the speed of a thunder bolt of Indra theLord of celestials and possessing the brilliance of a fire, hurled it to kill Sugreeva."
6-59-39,"That arrow released by Ravana's arm reached Sugreeva, having a bodily splendourequal to that of Indra's thunder bolt, and pierced his body in its flight as formerly Guha's spearwhen he discharged it at the Krauncha Mountain."
6-59-40,"Wounded by that arrow, which bereft him of consciousness, that warrior fell moaningto the earth. Beholding him falling on the ground, deprived of his senses in the battle-field, thedemons raised a shout of triumph."
6-59-41,"Then, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sushena, Rishabha, Jyotimukha and Nala; of exceedingcorpulence tearing up rocks, rushed towards Ravana."
6-59-42,"That Lord of Demons, with hundreds of arrows, possessed of sharp points, renderedtheir projectiles fruitless and pierced those leaders of the monkeys with a multitude of marvellousgolden shafted arrows."
6-59-43,"Pierced by the arrows of Ravana the Enemy of Gods, those monkey-Generals ofterrifying stature fell on the ground. Thereupon, he covered that formidable army of monkeys with ashower of arrows."
6-59-44,"Assailed and fallen down, those monkey-warriors, emitted cries as though struck byan arrow of terror, whom Ravana was destroying with his darts and fled for refuge to Rama who iscapable of affording protection to all."
6-59-45,"Then the high-souled Rama the skilful archer, taking his bow, set out at once.Lakshmana, however, approaching him with joined palms, spoke very meaningful words follows:"
6-59-46,"O, noble Brother! Of my own accord, I am able to kill this wretched Ravana. O,Lord! I shall slay him. Permit me to do so."
6-59-47,"The exceedingly powerful and the truly courageous Rama spoke to that Lakshmana asfollows: ""Go, Lakshmana and also be strenuous in this duel."""
6-59-48,"Ravana is endowed with great strength and possesses an outstanding prowess during a war. The Three Worlds themselves could not withstand his fury. There is no doubt about it."
6-59-49,"Seek out his weak points and guard against your own. Defend yourself vigilantlywith your eye and bow."
6-59-50,"Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana embraced him, thereafter offering obeisance andbidding him farewell, he entered the battle-field."
6-59-51,"Lakshmana then saw Ravana with arms as large as the trunks of elephants, who wasbrandishing his dreadful and fiery bow, covering those monkeys whose bodies he had severed with aclose rain of darts."
6-59-52,"The exceedingly energetic Hanuma, born of Maruta the god of wind, beholding this,rushed on Ravana in order to bring that rain of arrows to an end."
6-59-53,"Approaching his chariot, the sagacious Hanuma lifted his right arm and spoke thefollowing threatening words to Ravana:"
6-59-54,"You have obtained the boon of invulnerability to the celestials, demons, celestialmusicians, ogres and semi-divine beings. But monkeys are a danger to you."
6-59-55,"This five-branched right hand of mine, which I now raise, will rob you of your lifethat has long been resident in your body."
6-59-56,"Hearing the words of Hanuma, the exceedingly valiant Ravana, his eyes inflamed withanger, answered."
6-59-57,"Strike quickly without fear, O Monkey! Win eternal renown. Thereafter, I shalldestroy you, after measuring your strength."
6-59-58,"Hearing the words of Ravana, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke the following words:""Recollect that I have killed your son Aksha already."""
6-59-59,"Thus spoken, the highly energetic and the valiant Ravana the Lord of Demons struckHanuma the son of Anila a violent blow on his chest with the palm of his hand."
6-59-60,"Hanuma, thus struck with Ravana's palm, reeled repeatedly. Thereafter the highlysagacious and illustrious Hanuma secured his balance within a moment and in fury, struck Ravana theenemy of Immortals with the very palm of his hand."
6-59-61,"Under the violent impact of the blow of the mighty Hanuma Ravana shook like amountain when the earth trembles."
6-59-62,"Beholding Ravana struck in the fight by Hanuma's palm; the sages, monkeys,semi-divine beings, along with celestials and demons raised a resounding approbation."
6-59-63,"Then, the extremely spirited Ravana, having regained his breath, spoke the followingwords: ""Well done! Well done! O, monkey! You are my adversary, worthy of praise by yourvalour!"""
6-59-64,"Then, Hanuma answered, ""O, Ravana! Cursed by that strength since you do stillsurvive!"""
6-59-65,"O, foolish fellow! Why this boasting? Now come, strike me once! My fist is about todispatch you to the Abode of Yama the Lord of Death!"
6-59-66,"Hearing the words of Hanuma, the powerful Ravana, enraged, his eyes red with furyand whirling his fist with force knocked it down violently on Hanuma's chest."
6-59-67,"Under the shock, Hanuma reeled once again. Seeing that mighty Hanuma exhausted,Ravana turned his chariot towards Nila."
6-59-68,"With his terrific arrows in the likeness of serpents, Ravana the powerful Lord ofDemons pierced the vital parts of his enemy, thus overwhelming Nila the Monkey-general."
6-59-69,"Nila, the Army General of Monkeys, tormented by that hail of arrows, with one handhurled a great rock at Ravana the king of demons."
6-59-70,"Meanwhile, Hanuma of exalted mind, burning with courage, regained his breath and inhis martial ire cried out furiously towards Ravana, the Lord of Demons who occupied in fight withNila as follows: ""It is not proper to engage in a combat with a person who is already doing a fightwith another."""
6-59-71,"Then, the mighty Ravana, however, shattered the rock hurled by Nila with sevenpointed arrows and it fell down, crumbling to pieces."
6-59-72,"Seeing that rock crumbling to pieces, Nila the Army-general the destroyer of enemieswho resembled the Fire of Time, glowed with fury."
6-59-73,"In that fight, Nila hurled Aswakarna trees, Shala trees with extensive flowering,Chuta trees and other various types of trees."
6-59-74,"Ravana, confronting those trees, bursted them and showered a hail of dangerous dartson Nila the son of Fire-God."
6-59-75,"Showered by a multitude of shafts, as from a cloud, the mighty Nila assumed adiminutive form and leapt on to the point of Ravana's standard."
6-59-76,"Seeing Nila the son of Fire-God standing well on the point of his standard, Ravanainflamed with fury. Then, Nila shouted loudly."
6-59-77,"Beholding that monkey sometimes leaping on to the point of Ravana's standardsometimes on to the tip of his bow and sometimes on to the peak of his diadem, Lakshmana, Hanumaand Rama were astonished."
6-59-78,"The mighty Ravana, amazed at the monkey's agility, seized a marvellous and glowingarrow called Agneya the weapon of Fire."
6-59-79,"Thereafter, those monkeys who felt rejoiced to see Ravana disconcerted at theagility of Nila and had found an occasion for jubilation, shouted joyously."
6-59-80,"Then, provoked by the shouts of the monkeys, his heart possessed with confusing,Ravana did not know what to do."
6-59-81,"Ravana the demon, taking up an arrow, charged with the missile presided over by thefire-God, aimed at Nila who had perched on the tip of his standard."
6-59-82,"Then, Ravana the king of demons said,: ""O monkey! You are endowed with agilitycombined with a supreme power of magic."""
6-59-83,"Do you save your life if you can, eventhogh you are creating numerous deeds ofvarious kinds indeed worthy of your own self, O, monkey!"
6-59-84,"Even then, the arrow charged with a mystic missile I am about to loose, will severeyou from life, which existence you seek to preserve."
6-59-85,"Thus speaking, Ravana the long-armed King of Demons, having placed Agni Missile withhis arrow, struck Nila the Army-General."
6-59-86,"Struck on the chest by the arrow combined with a missile, Nila being burnt all over,suddenly fell to the ground."
6-59-87,"Yet by virtue of the powerful aid of his father and his own native vigour, thoughbrought to his knees on to the earth, he was not deprived of his life."
6-59-88,"Seeing Nila unconscious, Ravana, eager for fight, in his chariot whose rattlingsounded like thunder-clouds, rushed on Lakshmana."
6-59-89,"Coming to the centre of the battle-field, the powerful Ravana the King of Demonsprevented Lakshmana to go forward, halted, standing there in his glory and lifted up his bow."
6-59-90,"Lakshmana of indomitable courage spoke to that Ravana who was lifting up hisunfathomable bow (as follows): ""O, King of Demons! Now enter into combat with me; cease fromfighting with the monkeys!"""
6-59-91,"Hearing that marvellously modulated voice that resounded like the twanging of abow-string, Ravana drawing near his adversary, who stood close to his chariot, answered inanger:"
6-59-92,"O, Lakshmana! By my good fortune, you in your perverted mind, reached within myrange of sight so as to meet your death. This very instant, you will go to the region of Death,after having collapsed by the bang of my rain of arrows."
6-59-93,"Then, Lakshmana, unmoved spoke to that Ravana who was roaring with his sharp andprotruding teeth (as follows): ""Greatly dignified ones eschew bragging! O, the foremost ofevil-doers! You are sounding your own praises!"""
6-59-94,"O, King of Demons! I know your valour, strength, energy and courage! Come! I nowstand here, with my bow and arrows in hand. O what use are vain boasts."
6-59-95,"Thus accosted, the King of Demons, infuriated, loosened seven marvellously plumedarrows which Lakshmana shattered with his beautiful golden-shafted arrows of sharp ends andedges."
6-59-96,"Beholding those arrows shattered like great cobras with their hoods shattered,Ravana got angry and loosened other sharp arrows."
6-59-97,"Lakshmana, however, caused a well-aimed rain of missiles from his bow to fall onRavana and nay, even broke Ravana's arrows with his arrows called Khura, Ardhachandra, theexcellent Karni and Bhalla. He did not feel perturbed."
6-59-98,"Seeing his successive arrows proving in vain, Ravana the King of those hostile toGods was astonished at Lakshmana's skill and released more whetted shafts upon him."
6-59-99,"Lakshmana, the equal of Mahendra the Lord of celestials, fixing some sharpenedarrows, swift as lightning and of blazing effulgence on his bow-string, discharged them on Ravanain order to strike him down."
6-59-100,"Whereupon, Ravana the King of Demons shattered those pointed arrows and struckLakshmana in the forehead with a struck Lakshmana in the forehead with a shaft as bright as theFire of Time, which had been bestowed on him by Brahma the Lord of Creation."
6-59-101,"Struck by Ravana's arrow, Lakshmana reeled a little and was scarcely able to retainhis bow. But, coming to his consciousness with difficulty, he shattered that weapon belonging toRavana, Indra's enemy."
6-59-102,"Then, Lakshmana the son of Dasaratha struck Ravana, whose bow was broken, with threepointed darts. The king, pierced by those arrows, swooned and regained his senses withdifficulty."
6-59-103,"Ravana, the enemy of celestials, whose bow was broken, struck by the arrows, hislimbs spattered with flesh, and streaming with blood, himself of formidable energy, seized in thebattle a spear gifted to him by Brahma the Lord of Creation."
6-59-104,"Ravana the Lord of the country of demons hurled with strength on Lakshmana, thatblazing spear, emitting smoke and as bright as fire, frightening the monkeys in the fray."
6-59-105,"Lakshmana the younger brother of Bharata struck that weapon falling upon him witharrows and darts, as if it were a sacrificial fire. Nevertheless, that spear entered Lakshmana'sbroad chest."
6-59-106,"The mighty Lakshmana, struck by the spear, lay on the earth, breathing fire. Theking, rushing suddenly on him who was yet insensible, seized him brutally in his hands."
6-59-107,"Though he was able to lift up Himavat, Mandara and Meru mountains as also the ThreeWorlds with the Gods, he could not raise Lakshmana the younger brother of Bharata."
6-59-108,"Lakshmana, though wounded in the breast by Brahma's weapon, recollected that he wasan inconceivable fraction of Vishnu Himself."
6-59-109,"Ravana that thorn in the side of the Gods, though overcoming that Lakshmana whoremoved the pride of demons, was unable to bear him away with his hands."
6-59-110,"Thereupon, the enraged Hanuma the son of the Wind-God, rushed towards Ravana andstruck angrily on his chest with his fist, resembling a thunder-bolt."
6-59-111,"By that blow of the fist, Ravana the Lord of Demons reeled and fell on his knees tothe ground."
6-59-112,"A lot of blood oozed out from his face, eyes, and ears. Reeled and motionless, hebecame and sat in the middle of the chariot."
6-59-113,"Seeing Ravana despite his redoubtable strength swooned on the battle-field, sagesand monkeys began to shout in triumph as did also celestials and the demons (invisibly present onthe scene)."
6-59-114,"Then, the courageous Hanuma lifting up Lakshmana in his arms, who had been woundedby Ravana, brought him to Rama's presence."
6-59-115,"That Lakshmana, whom his foes were unable to move, became light for Hanuma becauseof friendship and great devotion of Hanuma the son of Wind-God towards him."
6-59-116,"That spear leaving Lakshmana, who was overcome in the battle, returned to itsposition in that chariot of Ravana."
6-59-117,"The mighty Ravana too, regaining his consciousness in the great battle-field, pickedup his sharp arrows and the great bow."
6-59-118,"Healed and free from that lance, Lakshmana the annihilator of his foes, recollectedof himself as a part of the inconceivable Vishnu the Lord of Preservation."
6-59-119,"Beholding the great army of monkeys whose great warriors were overthrown on thebattle-field, Rama rushed on Ravana."
6-59-120,"Meanwhile, Hanuma approaching Rama spoke the following words: ""You have to punishthe demon by climbing my back, as Vishnu on Garuda in order to fight with the Enemy of Gods."""
6-59-121,"Hearing those words spoken by Hanuma the son of Wind-God, Rama soon after mountedthe great monkey, Hanuma. Rama the Lord of men then saw Ravana standing in his chariot in thebattle-field."
6-59-122,"The mighty Rama became angry on seeing him and rushed upon that Ravana like untoVishnu with his uplifted mace rushed upon Virochana."
6-59-123,"Rama made a sound in drawing the cord of his bow and like unto the roll of thunder,spoke in a deep voice to Ravana as follows:"
6-59-124,"O, Tiger among the Demons! Stay, stay! Having evoked such a displeasure to me,where will you flee and get an abandonment?"
6-59-125,"Even if you seek refuge in the region of Indra the Lord of celestials or Yama theLord of Death or the Sun or Brahma the Lord of Creation or Agni the Lord of Fire or Shiva the Lordof dissolution or in the ten regions, even in those abodes you will elude me from now on."
6-59-126,"O, Ravana the King of Demons! The one who was struck by the spear, fell swoopingthis day only to recover consciousness immediately, will now, assuming the form of death, claimyou, your sons and grandsons in battle."
6-59-127,"Here is he, under whose blows of arrows, fourteen thousand demons of terrible formperished, who had established themselves in Janasthana and were furnished with excellentweapons."
6-59-128,"Hearing the words of Rama, Ravana of great strength, full of rage and recollectinghis former hostility struck with flaming arrows resembling the tongues of the Fire of Dissolution,on Hanuman the son of Wind-God, who with extreme velocity, was bearing Rama in thebattle-field."
6-59-129,"Even when struck by that demon with his arrows in the battle, the vigour of Hanuman,who was endowed with native strength, increased still further."
6-59-130,"Thereupon, seeing Hanuman the Tiger among the monkeys getting wounded by Ravana,Rama was transported with anger."
6-59-131,"Going near his chariot with his sharp and pointed arrows, Rama shattered it alongwith its wheels, horses, banner, canopy, great standard, charioteer, darts, spears and swords."
6-59-132,"Thereupon, with a great force, Rama struck with his shaft shining brightly as thethunderbolt, that Ravana, the enemy of Indra, in his broad and beautiful chest, even as the mightyIndra would strike the Mount Meru with his thunderbolt."
6-59-133,"That valiant King of Demons, whom neither thunder nor lightning could causedisturbance or trembling; stumbled letting fall his bow at the valiant impact of Rama's missilewhich created a deep injury."
6-59-134,"Seeing that Ravana swooning, the magnanimous Rama took up a blazing arrow shapedlike a crescent moon and immediately used it to shatter the diadem of Ravana the Lord of Demons,which was of bright hue."
6-59-135,"In that battle-field, Rama said to that Lord of Demons whose splendour was dimmed,the setting of his diadem river, who resembled a venomous snake robbed of its poison or like a sunits rays extinguished, bereft of lustre."
6-59-136,"You have accomplished a highly terrific great feat and my brave soldiers havesuccumbed beneath your blows. Now, you are weary and in this condition, I shall not put you underthe clutches of Death."
6-59-137,"O, King of the Ranger of night! I know you have been tormented in the battle. Goand return to Lanka. Having regained your breath, come back in your chariot with your bow and thenstanding in your chariot, you will witness once more my prowess."
6-59-138,"At these words, that King Ravana, his joy boasting subdued, his bow shattered, hishorses and chariot slain pierced with arrows, his great diadem broken, he soon returned toLanka."
6-59-139,"While that mighty Ravana the Lord of Demons and the enemy of celestials and titansreturned to Lanka, Rama arranged for drawing out arrows from monkeys and from Lakshmana too, in theforefront of that vast battle-field."
6-59-140,"That Ravana, the adversary of the King of the Gods being vanquished, the celestials,Asuras the multitude of beings in all the quarters, the creatures of the ocean with the greatserpents as also all beings on earth and in waters rejoiced very much."
6-60-1,"Returning to the City of Lanka, Ravana the King of Demons was afflicted with thefear of Rama's arrows, his pride was humbled and his senses troubled."
6-60-2,"The king was overcome by the high-souled Rama, like an elephant is by a lion or aserpent by an eagle."
6-60-3,"The Lord of Demons was maddened in recollecting Rama's arrows resembling the Rod ofBrahma the Lord of creation and possessed of the splendour of lightning."
6-60-4,"Resting on an excellent and charming throne made of gold, Ravana looked at thedemons and spoke the following words:"
6-60-5,"All that great penance performed by me became a waste indeed, for, I who am equalto Mahendra the Lord of Celestials have been defeated by a mere man!"
6-60-6,"The terrible words of Brahma the Lord of Creation saying, 'You know of the threatfrom men' appear true. That is so."
6-60-7,"I sought immunity from death at the hands of celestials, titans or celestialsmusicians, or semi divine beings or demons or serpent-demons, but f man I made no mention."
6-60-8,"Rama the son of Dasaratha is the man I think of whom Anaranya born of Ikshvakudynasty formerly spoke, saying: 'O, the worst of demons, the worst of your race and the wretchedone! In my race will be born a man who will slay you in battle with your sons, ministers, army,horses and charioteer."
6-60-9,"Further, I was formerly cursed by Vedavati when she was humiliated by me. The sameVedavati is born as the highly fortunate Seetha the daughter of Janaka."
6-60-10,"What was predicted by Parvati the consort of Shiva, Nandishvara the attendant ofShiva, Rambha the wife of Nalakubara and Punjikasthala the daughter of Varunda has come to pass!The words of the sages never prove false."
6-60-11,"On account of all this and admitting it, you should exert yourselves to theuttermost. Let the demons go to the summit of Charya Mountain."
6-60-12,"Awaken that kumbhakarna, who is without equal in prowess, who humbles the pride ofthe celestials and demons, and on whom the curse of Brahma the Lord of creation rests."
6-60-13,"Having known that Prahasta being slain and knowing himself to have been defeated inthe battle, Ravana issued his commands tot he dreadful army, saying:"
6-60-14,"Guard the gates with utmost care. Man the ramparts. Rouse Kumbhakarna who isslumbering soundly."
6-60-15,"Kumbhakarna is sleeping happily, his understanding vitiated by lust and free fromall anxieties. The demon sleeps for nine, seven, ten or eight months."
6-60-16,"Having deliberated with me nine days ago, he has since fallen asleep. Awakenquickly that mighty Kumbhakarna."
6-60-17,"The mighty armed Kumbhakarna, the foremost of all demons will kill the monkeys andthe two princes at once in the battle."
6-60-18,"This Kumbhakarna, the chief among all the demons and a great mark in the battle,being fond of a rustic comfort, is always sleeping stupidly."
6-60-19,"If Kumbhakarna is awaken, there will be no worry for me, who stand defeated by Ramain this highly terrific battle."
6-60-20,"What is the use of him, who possessing a strength equal to that of Indra the Lordof celestials, cannot help me in such a dreadful catastrophe?"
6-60-21,"Hearing those words of Ravana, those demons very briskly went to the abode ofKumbhakarna."
6-60-22,"Entering the beautiful cave of Kumbhakarna, with a large door, having an area of aYojana on all sides and bearing a floral perfume, the demons of mighty strength, though shaken offby Kumbhakarna's breaths, remained stable forcefully with difficulty and went into the cave."
6-60-23,"Entering that beautiful cave inlaid with diamonds and gold, those tigers amongdemons beheld Kumbhakarna, of terrific prowess, who was sleeping."
6-60-24,"They together tried to awaken Kumbhakarna who was sleeping nastily like a spread-outmountain in a great slumber."
6-60-25,"His limbs covered with down which stood on end, breathing like a serpent, as heslept, Kumbhakarna of irresistible valour emitted dreadful snores, his nostrils being horrible, andhis mouth a gaping hell. Stretched to his full length on the earth, he gave forth an odour ofmarrow and blood, his limbs were adorned with golden armlets and he wore a diadem as bright as thesun, thus did that lion among demons, Kumbhakarna, the slayer of his foes, appear!"
6-60-26,"Then, those powerful demons, in order to satisfy him, placed a heap of venison ashigh as Mount Meru, in front of Kumbhakarna."
6-60-27,"Those excellent demons piled up a great mass of wonderful food with the meat ofdeers, buffaloes and pigs."
6-60-28,"Then, the demons placed pots of blood and various kinds of meat in front ofKumbhakarna."
6-60-29,"They rubbed Kumbhakarna the scourge of his foes with the most rare sandalwood andrefreshed him with celestial and fragrant garlands as well as sweet-smelling perfumes."
6-60-30,"They burnt incenses and hymned the praises of that warrior who proved fatal to hisfoes. They cried out noises which burst forth on every side like thunder."
6-60-31,"They blew couches which were as bright as the moon and with impatience, made withimpatience, made sounds tumultuously all at once."
6-60-32,"Those demons made sounds by clapping their hands, in order to awaken Kumbhakarna andshook him too, creating a great clamour."
6-60-33,"The birds passing through the sky ran helter-shelter and fell down soon on hearingthe sounds of the couches, drums, gongs, clapping of hands and leonine roars."
6-60-34,"As the illustrious Kumbhakarna did not waken from his slumber despite those greatsounds, all troops of demons seized hold of bars, pestles and maces towards him."
6-60-35,"Then, the cruel demons struck that sleeping Kumbhakarna on his chest withmountain-tops, pestles, maces, hammers and their fists."
6-60-36,"Even with all their strength, the demons could not stand upright before thebreathing winds of Kumbhakarna, the demon."
6-60-37,"Then, the terribly strong demons firmly seated themselves round him and began tobeat drums, cymbals, kettle-drums and myriads of couches and trumpets."
6-60-38,"Ten thousand demons surrounded him all at once. Beating that colossus who resembleda heap of antimony, the demons on their part tried to rouse him by making sounds. Even then, he didnot wake."
6-60-39,"As they were unable to rouse him by these means, they resorted to more energetic andruthless methods."
6-60-40,"They beat horses, camels, donkeys, and elephants with sticks whips and thongs, sothat they trample upon him and blasted kettle-drums, couches and drums."
6-60-41,"They crushed his limbs under piles of heavy logs and pillars, as also maces liftedwith all their strength."
6-60-42,"The entire Lanka, with its mountain and groves, was filled with great noise. Henevertheless did not wake."
6-60-43,"Then, they beat a thousand drums all around with sticks of refined gold."
6-60-44,"Yet, as he did not wake from his profound slumber, being under the spell of a curse,the demons were enraged."
6-60-45,"All those demons of terrible strength were filled with a great fury. Some othersassembled their strength to awaken that demon."
6-60-46,"Some beat drums, some shouted, some tore out his hair and some others bit hisears."
6-60-47,"Some poured hundreds of pitchers of water into his ears but Kumbhakarna, plunged indeep sleep, did not stir."
6-60-48,"Some strong ones, armed with rocks and hammers, struck the rocks and hammers on hishead, chest and other limbs."
6-60-49,"Though smitten by missiles fastened with ropes on all sides, the giant bodied demondid not wake."
6-60-50,"A thousand elephants ran up and down on his body till Kumbhakarna lightly woke upand became aware of the pressure."
6-60-51,"Being insensible to those violent blows of crags and trees hurled upon him, butunder the prompting of extreme hunger, Kumbhakarna suddenly sprang up from sleep, yawning due toloss of sleep."
6-60-52,"Waving his arms resembling serpent's coils or the peaks of mountains, hard as cutdiamonds, that demons opening his monstrous month like unto the face of a submarine fire,yawned."
6-60-53,"His mouth yawning horribly resembled hell and appeared like the sun rising under thehigh peak of Meru Mountain."
6-60-54,"That mighty demon, being awake, yawned, heaving a sigh, like unto a tempest arisingfrom a mountain."
6-60-55,"That figure of Kumbhakarna, rising up, stood out resembling Time at the dissolutionof the world, prepared to devour all beings."
6-60-56,"His huge eyes, resembling flames of fire, with a glitter equal to that of lightning,appeared like great blazing planets."
6-60-57,"Then, the demons pointed to various kinds of victuals, boar and buffalo. The mightyKumbhakarna devoured them."
6-60-58,"Then, the hungry Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Indra, ate the meat and being thirstydrank the blood and gulped pitchers full of fat and wine."
6-60-59,"Thereupon, knowing that Kumbhakarna was gratified of his hunger, the demonsapproached him, saluting him with their heads bent and surrounded him on all sides."
6-60-60,"Raising his eyelids that were heavy with sleep, his gaze still veiled, he directedhis glance towards those demons and spoke as follows:"
6-60-61,"That excellent demons kindly addressing all the demons and surprised at beingroused, spoke the following words to the demons:"
6-60-62,"For what reason have you thus wakened me so suddenly? Is all well with the king oranything in peril here?"
6-60-63,"Surely, there must be some great danger from an external source since you havewakened me in haste."
6-60-64,"Now, I shall drive away the misfortune from Ravana the King of Demons, even if Ihave to cut Mahendra himself to pieces or to freeze the Fire."
6-60-65,"For a petty reason, one does not indeed awaken, one such as I, from my slumber.Hence, tell me frankly, for what reason you have roused me."
6-60-66,"Yupaksha, a minister of the King, with his hands joined salutation, spoke (asfollows) to Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of his enemies, thus talking excitedly."
6-60-67,"O, Prince! There is no threat whatsoever at anytime for us from celestials but amere man is driving us back by a tumultuous tremor."
6-60-68,"O, Prince! It is not indeed the celestials or demons who have put us in such aperil as it comes to us from a man."
6-60-69,"Monkeys, whose forms are as large as mountains, are besieging Lanka. There is atumultuous peril for us from Rama, who is furious on account of Seetha's abduction."
6-60-70,"Already, a single monkey set fire to our great city of slew the youthful PrinceAksha with his escort of elephants and retinue."
6-60-71," ' Get thee hence' were the words addressed by Rama who is equal to the sun insplendour, to Ravana in person the Lord of Demons and the trouble-some person to celestials."
6-60-72,"That which this king never suffered at the hands of Gods or Demons or Danavas, hehas had to endure here from Rama, who released him from the danger to his life."
6-60-73,"Hearing about the humiliation of his brother in the battle through the words ofYupaksha, Kumbhakarna rolling his great eyes, spoke to Yupaksha (as follows):"
6-60-74,"O, Yupaksha! Now itself, after conquering the entire army of monkeys with Lakshmanaand Rama on the battle-field, then only I shall see Ravana."
6-60-75,"I shall satiate the demons with the flesh and blood of monkeys and, as for Rama andLakshmana, I shall drink their blood myself."
6-60-76,"Hearing these haughty from that demon, whose anger increased his ferocity, Mahodarathe chief of warriors of demons, having offered obeisance with joined palms, spoke the followingwords:"
6-60-77,"O, the mighty armed! When you have listened to the words of Ravana and consideredthe advantages and disadvantages of the matter, even afterwards you can conquer the enemies inbattle."
6-60-78,"Hearing the words of Mahodara, the might Kumbhakarna of great valour prepared todepart, surrounded by demons."
6-60-79,"The demons, having awaken that sleeping Kumbhakarna of dreadful eyes, form andvalour, went to the King's palace in haste."
6-60-80,"All those demons, approaching Ravana who was seated on the throne, said to him withjoined palms, as follows:"
6-60-81,"O, Lord of Demons! Kumbhakarna, your brother, has wakened. Is it your will that heshould enter the battle field from there itself or do you desire him to come here and see you?"
6-60-82,"Ravana answered those demons who stood before him and with a glad heart, said: ""Iwant to see him here. Bring him after extending the honours due to him in a befitting manner."""
6-60-83,"Uttering ""Be it so"", all those demons as commanded by Ravana, returned toKumbhakarna and spoke the following words:"
6-60-84,"The king, the lion of all the demons, desires to see you. Go and gratify yourbrother!"
6-60-85,"Hearing his brother's wish, Kumbhakarna the inviolable demon of great prowess,uttering ""so be it"", leapt up from his couch."
6-60-86,"Washing his face and bathing, refreshed and delighted, adorning himself well andfeeling thirsty, he hastened them to bring him a drink which can boost up his strength."
6-60-87,"Thereupon, those demons brought him quickly the wine and various kinds of eatablethere, in their hurry to take Kumbhakarna with them as per Ravana's commands."
6-60-88,"Having drunk two thousand pitchers, Kumbhakarna prepared to set out and slightlyinebriated and flushed, he was exhilarated and filled with energy."
6-60-89,"The fuming Kumbhakarna, going to his brother's palace along with the army of demons,appeared like Yama the Lord of Death at the end of all-destroying Time. He caused the earth totremble with his foot-steps, while marching."
6-60-90,"The royal high way was illumined by his body, like unto that orb of a thousand rays(the sun) by its flashes illumines the earth and he went there, surrounded by a circle of demonspaying obeisance, resembling Indra the Lord of Celestials approaching the abode of Brahma the Lordof Creation."
6-60-91,"Seeing that slayer of his foes on the royal high way, that monster as high as thepeak of a mountain, those monkeys stationed outside the city, as also their leaders, werefrightened suddenly."
6-60-92,"Some gained refuge in Rama who affords protection, some fell down tottering, somefled away perturbed in all directions and some others lay on the ground, confounded with fear."
6-60-93,"Seeing that colossus appearing like a great peak, having a diadem who seemed totouch the sun with his brilliance, the monkeys were seized with terror and had grown immensely insize, fled hither and thither."
6-61-1,"Having taken his bow, Rama of great brilliance and prowess, then beheld the bulkyKumbhakarna, adorned with a diadem."
6-61-2,"Seeing that paramount demon, whose appearance was in the form of a mountain andlooking like Lord Narayana (the son of the original Man); taking strides across space, (manifestedin the form of Trivikrama, who measured the whole universe in a couple of strides) Rama becamevigilant."
6-61-3,"Beholding him again, who was appear like a rainy black cloud and wearing a goldenbracelet as an ornament on his upper arm, that huge army of monkeys took to their heels in fullspeed."
6-61-4,"Seeing the army running away and the demon increasing his body, Rama with asurprise, spoke to vibhishana as follows:"
6-61-5,"This eminent demon, appearing as a mountain, with a diadem and tawmy eyes andlooking like a cloud with a flash of lightning, is seen in Lanka. Who is he?"
6-61-6,"He alone with a huge body here on this earth, is appearing like a solitary meteror,by seeing whom all the monkeys are running away hither and thither."
6-61-7,"Who is he with such a colossal body? Tell me whether he is a demon or an evilspirit. I have not seen such a creature earlier at any time."
6-61-8,"Thus asked by Rama the prince, who was unweary in action, the highly intelligentVibhishana replied to Rama as follows:"
6-61-9,"He is the powerful Kumbhakarna, the son of Visravasa. He conquered Yama and Indrain battle. Tehre is no other demon, corresponding to the size of his body."
6-61-10,"O Rama! He conquered thousands of celestials, demons, a class of demi-gods, serpentdemons, ogres, Gandharvas teh celestial musicians, Vidyadharas the celestials artistes and Kinnaras(the semi-divine beings with the human form and the head of a horse) in battle."
6-61-11,"Seeing the mighty Kumbharana with ghastly eyes and a spear in hand, the celestialswere not able to kill him, having confused to think that he was yama the god of Death."
6-61-12,"This Kumbhakarna, by his very nature, is energetic and mighty. The strength of theother demon-chiefs is attributable to boons (granted on request by gods)."
6-61-13,"Soon after his birth, this great-souled demon, afflicted as he was by hunger, atethousands of living creatures."
6-61-14,"While the living being were being eaten, the frightened people sought refuge withIndra and even reported the matter about him."
6-61-15,"That Mahendra wielding a thunder-bolt was enraged and struck Kumbhakarna with hisweapon of the white thunderbolt. The great souled Kumbhakarna struck by Indra's thunderbolt wasquite agitatated at it and roared loudly with anger."""
6-61-16,"Hearing the roar of that Kumbakarna, the demon, wh was howling loudly, thegrigthened people were further frightened."
6-61-17,"Enraged as he was on Mahendra, the mighty Kumbhakarna then pulled out a tusk ofAiravata, Indra's elephant and struck it into Indra's chest."
6-61-18,"That Devendra, tormented by the hit of Kumbhakarna, was burning with rage. Thecelestials, Brahmanical sages and demons were suddenly aggrieved. Even Indra with his people wentto the abode of Brahma the Lord of creation."
6-61-19,"They informed about the evil-mind of Kumbhakarna to Brahma, how he devoured theliving creatures, his assault on celestials, the destroyal of hermitages and his taking away ofothers' wives."
6-61-20,"If he eats away the created beings continuously like this, the world will becomedesolate just soon after some time."
6-61-21,"On hearing the words of Indra, Brahama, the great grandfather of the entire world,called for the demons and saw Kumbhakarna too along with them."
6-61-22,"Just on seeing Kumbhakarna even Brahma was frightened. Thereafter on restoring hisconfidence, Brahma cursed Kumbhakarna as follows:"
6-61-23,"It is sure that you were created by visravasa for the destroyal of people. On thataccount, you will be sleeping apparently dead from now onwards."
6-61-24,"Humbled by Brahma's curse, Kumbhakarna then fell down in front of Ravana.Thereupon, the highly perplexed Ravana spoke the following words:"
6-61-25,"'O Brahma! You are cutting off a well-grown golden tree, just at the time ofyielding its fruit. It is not fair on your part to curse your own great grandson like this."
6-61-26,"Your words can never prove to be in vain. There is no doubt about it. He will haveto sleep certainly. Let some space of time be fixed for his sleeping and waking."
6-61-27,"Hearing the words of Ravana, Brahma spoke as follows: He will indeed sleep for sixmonths and wake-up for a day."
6-61-28,"On that single day, this male demon, having starved for six months, will wanderover the earth and eat the human race with his month wide open, like an augmented fire."
6-61-29,"Ravana, the king of demons, who got into an evil plight and frightened as he was inseeing your prowess, now got Kumbhakarna awakened."
6-61-30,"This Kumbhakarna the male-demon with a terrific prowess started his tent. Thehighly enraged Kumbhakara devourincg the monkeys on is way, is running towards us."
6-61-31,"Even on merely seeing Kumbhakarna, the monkeys have now fled away. How can themonkeys check him, who is thus enraged in battle?"
6-61-32,"Let all the monkeys be told that it is a kind of machine, advancing forward. Byknowing this, they can become fearless by now."
6-61-33,"On hearing Vibhishana's words, which were well-founded to make the monkeyswell-inclined to fight the battle, Rama then spoke the follwoing words to neela, the chief ofarmy:"
6-61-34,"O Neela the son of fire-god. Go, marshalling the entire army. Occupying thedoor-ways, high-ways and bridges of Lanka, stand ready for operation."
6-61-35,"Draw together the mountain-tops, trees and even the rocks. Let all the monkeys withtheir weapons and rocks in hand, stand ready."
6-61-36,"As directed by Raghavana, Neela the commander-in-chief and the foremost of themonkeys, ordered the monkey-troops suitably."
6-61-37,"Then, Gavaksha, Sharabha, Hanuma and Angada looking like mountains, reached thegate, taking the mountian-tops."
6-61-38,"On hearing Rama's words, the fearless monkeys started their operation. The heroicmonkeys began to torment the enemy-troops with uplifted trees."
6-61-39,"That terrific army of monkeys, with uplifted rocks and tress in their hands, shonelike a big collection of gigantic clouds, hanging close to a mountain."
6-62-1,"That Kumbhakarna of great prowess and the foremost, having full of intoxicatingdrowsiness, marched along the king's highway, full of royal dignity."
6-62-2,"Then, that Kumbhakarna, who was very difficult to be conquered, accompanied bythousands of demons, sallied forth, covered with a shower of flowers from the houses (lining theway)."
6-62-3,"He saw Ravana's abode, covered with golden grilled windows, spacious and lookingbeautiful, like a shining sun."
6-62-4,"Entering Ravana's palace, like the sun entering a mass of clouds, Kumbhakarna thensaw from of distance his brother seated on a throne, as Indra saw Brahma perched on his seat."
6-62-5,"While going to his brother's palace, that Kumbhakarna, accompanied by troops ofdemons, caused the earth to shake with his stamping strides."
6-62-6,"Reaching his brother's house and entering the inner apartment, Kumbhakarna saw hisworried brother sitting in Pushpaka, a self-moving aerial car."
6-62-7,"On seeing Kumbhakarna who arrived there, Ravana then quickly rose up from his seat,delighted and brought him nearer to his side."
6-62-8,"Then, the mighty Kumbhakarna having offered salutation to the feet of his brothersitting on a sofa, asked him, ""What is to be done?"""
6-62-9,"Rising up from his seat, Ravana embraced him. That Kumbhakarna, who was thusembraced and made happy by his brother, occupied an auspicious, charming and excellent seat."
6-62-10,"Resting on that seat, the mighty Kumbhakarna, with his blood-shot eyes in anger,spoke to Ravana as follows:"
6-62-11,"O king! For what purpose have I been woken up by you, with effort? Tell me fromwhom is the danger for you here and who is to be killed."
6-62-12,"Ravana, with his eyes rolling with annoyance, spoke to Kumbhakarna, his brother, whowas there with anger (as follows):"
6-62-13,"O mighty Kumbhakarna! You slept for a long period. You, who were fast asleep, donot know about the fear created by Rama in me."
6-62-14,"This Rama, the son of Dasaratha, a strong man along with Sugreeva, having crossedthe ocean, is cutting short our race."
6-62-15,"Alas! See! Coming happily by a bridge, the forests and groves have been coveredwith an ocean full of monkeys."
6-62-16,"The monkeys killed very important demons in battle. I do not envisage, in any way,the destroyable of monkeys on the battle-field. It seems the monkeys were not even defeated at anytime before, in a combat."
6-62-17,"O mighty Kumbhakarna! Such a danger has arisen. You have to help us now. Get themdestroyed now. You have been woken up solely for that purpose."
6-62-18,"Rescuing me, whose treasury has become completely diminished, you protect this cityof Lanka, where only the children and the aged are left over."
6-62-19,"O the great armed Kumbhakarna. For the sake of your brother, perform this act,which is very difficult to do. O brother, the annihilator of enemies! In this way, I did notrequest anyone ever before."
6-62-20,"I have a great respect and affection towards you. O the foremost of demons! Forseveral times, in battles between gods and demons, you conquered the celestials and demons, afterattacking them in the battle."
6-62-21,"O Kumbhakarna of terrible prowess! Therefore, show your entire prowess. There isindeed no one, in the entire beings, who is equal to you in strength."
6-62-22,"O Kumbhakarna, delighting in war and feeling affection for relatives! Perform thisexcellent act, which is dear and beneficial to me, as per your liking. Blow away the army ofadversaries by your vital power, as an autumnal cloud is blown away by a high-rising wind."
6-63-1,"Hearing the lamentation of Ravana, Kumbhakarna laughed at a full volume and spoke as follows:"
6-63-2,"The same bad consequence, which was imagined by us earlier while taking the final decision after our consultation, is faced by you now, due to your utter disregard of the words spoken by your well-wishers."
6-63-3,"How a doer of wicked deeds indeed falls into damnation, so also a punishment for your sinful act has indeed reached your fast."
6-63-4,"O emperor! This course of action was not excepted by you at first. You did not conceive this consequence, only because of your sheer arrogance of power."
6-63-5,"He who, abiding in power, performs duties to be done earlier at a later stage and duties to be done later, at an early stage, does not know what is a right course and what is a wrong course."
6-63-6,"Action done perversely, regardless of space and time, get spoiled like offering oblations without properly making the fire well-prepared."
6-63-7,"He, who acts according to an agreement done with his counsellors, considering three types of duties*, by harassing five types of means**, moves along a right course."
6-63-8,"A king who wishes to execute am agreement as per law, understands it through his own intellect as well as the counsellors and discovers it through his friends, is on a right course."
6-63-9,"O king of demons! A man resorts to virtue or worldly gain or pleasure or all the three together or a twin combination of virtue and worldly gain or virtue and pleasure or worldly gain and pleasure or worldly gain and pleasure, according to an appointed time*."
6-63-10,"That sovereign king or crown prince, who, having heard which one is the best out of these three but does not keep it in mind, his extensive learning would be in vain."
6-63-11,"O the foremost of demons! Whosoever deliberates with his counsellors and resorts to an act of with his counsellors and resorts to an act of bestowing gifts or conciliation or sowing dissension at appropriate occasion or exhibits valour or resorts to them all together or takes recourse to both right action and the reverse of it at the right time or pursues virtue or worldly gain or pleasure at the appropriate time, that intelligent person never confronts a misfortune in this world."
6-63-12,"A sovereign has to do an act here, looking into his welfare as a consequence along with his counsellors who make their subsistence by their intelligence and who understand the true state of the things."
6-63-13,"Men with brutal ideas, who are initiated in discussions, aspire to tell haughty things, without fully knowing the precepts of the scriptures."
6-63-14,"The words spoken by those who did not know the scriptures, who do not recollect the books dealing with practical life and who covet for abundant wealth are not to be implemented."
6-63-15,"Those men who talk with audacity, some inimical things in a friendly way, are to be kept out of deliberations, as they certainly spoil the work to be done."
6-63-16,"Some counsellors, colluding with some learned adversaries, spoil their king and make them do wrong deeds."
6-63-17,"The king should make-out those ministers who have been transformed by the enemy to their side (through bribery and other things) and are enemies though looking like friends, through their conduct when a final decision is being taken after deliberation."
6-63-18,"Outsiders find out the fickleness of a ruler, who is led away by false appearances and quickly performs the acts, as birds discover the hole (made by the arrow of Skanda, the commander-in-chief of gods) in the Kruancha mountain."
6-63-19,"A king who disregards an enemy and does not protect himself, indeed faces disappointing occurrences and would be removed from his position."
6-63-20,"That advice which was tendered to you earlier by vibhishana is beneficial to us. Do whatever you wish to do."
6-63-21,"On hearing those words of Kumbhakarna, Ravana, on his part, twisted his eye-brows in anger and spoke the following words:"
6-63-22,"Why are you advising me like a venerable great teacher? What is the use in getting wearied of your speech? Let a work, most befitting of time, be performed."
6-63-23,"Now, it is a waste to tell again of that act which was wrongly done before, either by mistake or by an illusion of mind or by taking shelter in strength and prowess."
6-63-24,"Let whatever be appropriate at this moment be thought of now. Wise men do not repent over the past. Past is indeed but the past."
6-63-25,"If you have affection indeed for me or if you discover your own prowess and if you think it fit in your heart that my work is to be done very much, you nullify the hardship, born out of my wicked conduct, by your prowess."
6-63-26,"He who rescues an afflicted soul, whose fortune is ruined, he is the real friend. He who is ready at hand to help those who have deviated from the right course, is a kinsman."
6-63-27,"Thereupon, hearing those deeply harsh words spoken by Ravana and understanding that he is quite enraged, Kumbhakarna spoke slowly and smoothly."
6-63-28,"Observing that his brother is highly perturbed and excited of his senses, Kumbhakarna, while consoling him, gently spoke the following words:"
6-63-29,"O king, the annihilator of adversaries! Listen to my words attentively. O emperor of demons! Enough of your giving way to the anguish. Abandoning your anger completely, you ought to be your normal self again."
6-63-30,"O king! Until I live, this idea should not be formed in your mind. I shall destroy him, for whose account, you are feeling anguished."
6-63-31,"O king! In whatever situation you are placed, I have to give certainly a good advice to you. I gave this advice, because of our relation and brotherly affection."
6-63-32,"See that which is to be done and this juncture, out of affection by a brother, viz. the destruction of adversaries in battle, will be done by me."
6-63-33,"See today, O mighty armed king, the fleeing army of monkeys and Rama along with his brother being killed by me in the fore-front of the battle-field."
6-63-34,"O the mighty armed! Be happy by seeing that Rama&#39;s head, which I shall bring today from the battle. Let Seetha be unhappy."
6-63-35,"Let all those demons in Lanka, whose relatives have died in battle, witness the death of the most beloved Rama today."
6-63-36,"Today, I shall do the act of wiping off tears of demons, who have been afflicted with grief and lamenting because of the destruction of their relatives in combat by the adversaries."
6-63-37,"See today in battle, the mountain-like Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, looking like a cloud illuminated by the sun, thrown about, dissipated."
6-63-38,"O faultless Ravana! Why are you agitated now, when you are being consoled by those demons and by me, who are desirous of killing Rama?"
6-63-39,"O king of demons! Rama will indeed kill you, only after killing me. On that account, I do not regret for myself."
6-63-40,"O Ravana, having unequal prowess and the annihilator of enemies! You can command me, even now, as you wish. No other person need be sought, for a dispatch to the battle."
6-63-41,"I can destroy your enemies, who have a great strength. I can engage in combat with all those persons, whether he is Indra or Yama or the fire-god to the wind-god or even Varuna."
6-63-42,"Indra also gets frightened of me, having a mountain-sized body wielding a sharpened pike, having pointed tusks and even as I roar."
6-63-43,"Even otherwise, no one can stand alive in front of me, who is even weaponless and smashing the enemies by me strength alone."
6-63-44,"Without using a javelin or a mace or a sword or sharp arrows, I myself, on getting excited, can kill even Indra, with my bare hands."
6-63-45,"If Rama today survives even after facing the rapid blows of my fists, then my flood of arrows will drink the blood of Rama."
6-63-46,"O king! When I exist, why do you suffer from anxiety? Here, I am ready to sally forth for the destruction of your enemies."
6-63-47,"Be free from the terrific fear of Rama. In the battle, I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, the mighty Sugreeva and even Hanuma, by whom the city of Lanka was burnt off and the demons were killed."
6-63-48,"I shall devour the monkeys in battle, which is near at hand. I wish to contribute a tremendous and extraordinary reputation for you."
6-63-49,"&#39;O king! If you have a fear for Indra or even for Brahma, I shall remove it then, as the sun removes darkness of the night. When I am enraged, even celestials will lay down on the floor."
6-63-50,"I shall extinguish even Yama the god of death. I shall devour the fire-god. I shall cause the sun along with the stars to fall asunder on the floor."
6-63-51,"I shall kill Indra. I shall drink away the ocean. I shall crush the mountains into a powder. I shall tear up the earth."
6-63-52,"Let all the living beings, being devoured from all sides see today the prowess of Kumbhakarna, who slept for a long time. The entire heaven is not enough for my food."
6-63-53,"I am going to bring you happiness, conferring you a delight by the destroyal of Rama. Having killed Rama along with Lakshmana, I shall devour all the chiefs of army of monkeys."
6-63-54,"O king! You make merry today and drink wine. Throw away your agony and perform your usual duties. While I send Rama to the world of Yama, the god of death, Seetha will be subservient to your after a log time."
6-64-1,"Hearing those words spoken by the mighty Kumbhakarna of colossal body and largearms, Mahodara spoke as follows:"
6-64-2,"O Kumbhakarna! Though born in a good race, you are audacious, having the perceptionof an ordinary man as also arrogant. You are unable to know the right to be done at all times."
6-64-3,"O Kumbhakarna! It is not that the king does not know about the prudent and theimprudent conducts. Due to childishness and audacity, you, on your part, are craving merely totalk."
6-64-4,"The king of demons, knowing about apportioning of place and time, understands thesubject about strengthening and mining (of relationships) as well as his own position and theposition of others."
6-64-5,"What would a wise man attempt to do that which cannot be achieved by a man ofordinary intellect, though strong, does not sever his elders?"
6-64-6,"You are speaking as though virtue, wealth and pleasure are dwelling separately (inwater-tight compartments). By their very nature, there is no accurate description to know thosethings."
6-64-7,"Action alone is indeed the means to get all the consequences. Even sinful actsspring up into a fruit of prosperity!"
6-64-8,"Acts instrumental to virtue and wealth as well as other acts (instrumental toinjustice and non-value) have just the prosperity as their fruit. But, acts instrumental toinjustice and non-value gain the fruit of offence of omission."
6-64-9,"Living beings reap the fruit of good actions in this and in the other world.However, he who remains diligently devoted to actions with a view to attaining sensuous pleasureenjoys blessing even in this life."""
6-64-10,"In such a situation, this act of pursuit of sensuous pleasure has been cherished inhis heart by the king and was approved by us. What violation is there in doing this daring actagainst the enemy?"
6-64-11,"Regarding the reason which you have adduced for marching all alone for theencounter, I shall tell you what is irrelevant and not so good."
6-64-12,"How will you conquer, single-handed, that Rama by whom several mighty demons weredestroyed in Janasthana earlier."
6-64-13,"Are you not seeing those frightened demons (though highly energetic) who are nowstaying in the City, but who were earlier conquered by Rama in Janasthana?"
6-64-14,"Though you know that Rama, the son of Dsasratha, is like an enraged lion, you wishto awaken a serpent, who is sleeping."
6-64-15,"Who would be competent to approach that Rama, who is forever shining with asplendour, dangerous to catch-up and as unbearable as death?"
6-64-16,"Standing face-to-face with that enemy is all remaining in doubt. Going theresingle-handed does not indeed find favour with me."
6-64-17,"Having lost his advantage, who would feel inclined to reduce to submission, anenemy, who is rich in advantage and determined to lay down his life, as an ordinary person?"
6-64-18,"O Kumbhakarna, the foremost among the demons! How do you wish to combat with Rama,with whom none in the human beings is equal and who is equal of Indra and the sun?"
6-64-19,"Having thus spoken to the enraged Kumbhakarna, Mahodara on his part spoke asfollows, in the midst of demons, to Ravana, who made the people cry."
6-64-20,"Why are you delaying further, after having captured Seetha already? If you do sowish, Seetha will be submissive to you."
6-64-21,"Some strategy has been discovered by me, as a means of bringing her round. If it isfound agreeable to your intellect, then listen to it."
6-64-22,"Announce (by a beat of drum in the city-streets) that myself, Dvijihva, Samhraadi,Kumbhakarna and Vitardana these five demons are setting out for the battle to kill Rama."
6-64-23,"Thereupon, having gone to the battle field deliberately, we shall give him a fight.If we conquer your enemies, there is no need for any strategies to us."
6-64-24,"Otherwise, if our enemy survives, we, who have engaged in the fight, then shallimplement the plan which was resolved by us in the mind."
6-64-25,"Moistened with blood on having our bodies torn with arrows marked with the name ofRama engraved on them, we shall come back here from the battle."
6-64-26,"Saying ""Rama as well as Lakshmana has been devoured by us"", we shall clasp yourfeet. You fully grant our desire."""
6-64-27,"O king! Then, have it proclaimed by beating of trumpets in the entire city, on theback of an elephant, that Rama has been killed along with his brother and his army."
6-64-28,"O annihilator of enemies! Becoming pleased for the name-sake, arrange to bestow onyour servants, objects of enjoyment, other desired objects and gold."
6-64-29,"Then, present garlands, garments and cosmetics to champions as well as abundantgifts to other warriors. Drink yourself delighted."
6-64-30,"When this thick rumour has gone to all sides that Rama along with his companionshave been devoured by the demons and you approach Seetha in private and restoring her to confidenceand even conciliating her, tempt her with gold and grain, as well as luxuries and precioustones."
6-64-31,"By this false pretence, creating fear and anguish, Seetha who thinks she lost herhusband, will submit reluctantly to your will."
6-64-32,"Believing that her charming husband is destroyed, Seetha from her hopelessness andfeminine feeling of flexibility, will come to your will."
6-64-33,"Seetha, who grew up with comfort, who is deserving of happiness; but emaciated withgrief, knowing that her happiness depends on you, will by all means come near to you."
6-64-34,"After contemplating very well, I have conveyed like this. As soon as you see Rama,a calamity will happen. While you stay here itself without fighting, you will obtain a greatbenefit of happiness. Do not become restless."
6-64-35,"O king! An emperor who conquers his enemies without losing his army, withoutmeeting with danger and without a combat will obtain for long, a great fame, merit, prosperity andglory."
6-65-1,"Hearing the words of Mahodara, Kumbhakarna rebuked him and then spoke to hisbrother, Ravana, the chief of demons (as follows):"
6-65-2,"By annihilation of that evil-minded Rama, I will wipe-off your terrifc fear today.Be happy, indeed without any enmity."
6-65-3,"Warriors do not roar in vain as waterless clouds. Hear my roar, only on completionof my said task in battle."
6-65-4,"Warriors do not indulge in eulogizing themselves. They do difficult acts, without ashow."
6-65-5,"O Mahodara! Your words may be agreeable to those kings who are confused, who fancythemselves as the learned, and who themselves are stupid."
6-65-6,"You are all cowards in battle. You always speak pleasantly and go according to thewishes of the king. You, as such, have spoiled all the undertakings."
6-65-7,"Having access to this king, who has friends merely for a name-sake as also behavingunfriendly, the treasury got depleted, the army destroyed and king alone is left the Lanka."
6-65-8,"Intent on conquering the enemy, I sally for the battle today to set right yourimprudent policy."
6-65-9,"Hearing the words of the intellectual Kumbhakarna, Ravana the king of demons,bursting into laughter, replied as follows:"
6-65-10,"O dear brother, well-versed in the art of war-fare! This Mahodara is frightened ofRama. There is no doubt. He is not indeed inclined of a war."
6-65-11,"O Kumbhakarna! None is equal to you in friendship and strength, in my eyes. Youmarch to the battlefield for destroying the enemies and for achieving victory."
6-65-12,"O destroyer of enemies! You, who were sleeping, were awakened by me, for thepurpose of destroying the enemies. This is indeed a grand time for our demons."
6-65-13,"Therefore, go like Yama the god of death, by taking a dart and a noose in yourhand. Devour the monkeys and the princes whose splendour is like that of the sun."
6-65-14,"By seeing your very form, the monkeys will run away. The hearts of Rama andLakshmana will get broken asunder."
6-65-15,"Ravana, the king of demons, having a great energy, thus speaking to the mightyKumbhakarna, thought himself as though he was born again."
6-65-16,"The king, knowing the strength and prowess of Kumbhakarna, was delighted and becameas bright as the moon."
6-65-17,"Some were drowned in the ocean. Some had recourse into the caves. Some othersescaped. Some could not even stand stable on the ground. Some fell down. Some lied down, as thoughthey were dead."
6-65-18,"Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of enemies, speedily took up a sharp spike fully madeof iron, adorned with pure gold and splendidly shining."
6-65-19,"Taking hold of that large spike tinted with the blood of enemies, shining likeIndra's thunderbolt and equally heavy, capable of tormenting celestials, demons, Gandharvas, thecelestial musicians, Yakshas a class of demi-gods and Nagas the celestial serpents, wreathed ingarlands of crimson flowers with excessive splendour and emitting flames by itself naturally,Kumbhakarna of great brilliance spoke to Ravana the following words:"
6-65-20,"Let this large army stay back here. I shall go all alone. Being angry with hunger,I shall devour those monkeys now."
6-65-21,"Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, Ravana said, ""Go along with army, with theirspikes and hammers in hand."""
6-65-22,"The monkeys, with their huge bodies, valiant, with a much determination and withtheir teeth, will destroy anyone who is either alone or off one's guard."
6-65-23,"Therefore, go along with your troops as a person who is very difficult to beassaulted. Destroy the entire enemy-side, which in inimical to our demons."
6-65-24,"Rising up swiftly from his throne, Ravana endowed with a great energy, then placedaround the neck of Kumbhakarna, a necklace studded with a course of jewels."
6-65-25,"Ravana placed on the person of Kumbhakarna, armlets, rings, excellent jewellery anda handsome chain."
6-65-26,"Ravana arranged for ornamentation of his limbs with beautiful and sweet-smellinggarlands as well as ear-rings to his ears."
6-65-27,"Kumbhakarna with large ears, adorned with golden armlets and bracelets worn on hisupper arms along with ornament for his breast, shone like fire, well-fed with oblations."
6-65-28,"With a large, black and shining string worn round his loins, he was looking likeMount Mandara encircled by a serpent at the time of churning the ambrosia."
6-65-29,"Secured with a golden armour, carrying a great load, impenetrable by weapons and asif blazing with its own splendour with flashing like lightning, Kumbhakarna shone as a king ofMountains, enveloped by clouds at sunset."
6-65-30,"Adorned with all ornaments to all his limbs and with a spike in his hand, that demonshone like Narayana, the all-embracing Lord, enthusiastic to take the three long strides (whichwere meant to cover the entire universe)."
6-65-31,"Embracing his brother and even circumambulating him, the mighty Kumbhakarna salliedforth, after offering salutation to him by bowing down to him respectfully."
6-65-32,"Ravana sent off the mighty Kumbhakarna, having a colossal body, who was thensallying forth, with a great sound (of drums and musical instruments) and with laudablebenedictions."
6-65-33,"With loud sounds of counches and kettle-drums, with an army wielding excellentweapons, with elephants, with horses and with chariots making sounds of clouds, mighty charioteersaccompanied him who was the foremost among the charioteers."
6-65-34,"Those demons followed that terrific and mighty Kumbhakarna, mounting on serpents,camels donkeys, lions, elephants, wild beasts and birds."
6-65-35,"That Kumbhakarna, the enemy of ogres and celestials, wielding a sharp spike in hishand, while sallying forth, over whose head a parasol was held and drink and intoxicated by thesmell of blood."
6-65-36,"Many demons, possessing a great energy and great strength, with terrific forms andfearful eyes, as also wielding weapons in their hands, accompanied him as foot-soldiers."
6-65-37,"The demons followed, with their red hot eyes, large colossal bodies resembling amass of collyrium in hue, lifting up spikes, swords, sharp axes, javelins, iron rods, maces,mallets, enormous trunks of palmyrah trees to be hurled at and difficult to be met."
6-65-38,"Then, that Kumbhakarna, of a great splendour and a great strength, assuming anotherbody of a formidable and terrific form, with a breadth of a hundred bows and six hundred bows inheight, with his eyes resembling the wheels of a cart, looking like a huge mountain and terrible tolook at, sallied forth."
6-65-39,"Kumbhakarna with his colossal body and a huge mouth, looking like a scorched hill,approaching the demons and laughing loudly, spoke as follows:"
6-65-40,"Charged with anger, I shall burn up those troops of the foremost of monkeys, inlots today, as a flash of fire would burn up the moths."
6-65-41,"The monkeys who are in the habit of roaming about in the woods, have not offendedme of their own accord. That race of monkeys serves as an embellishment for the urban gardens in acity like ours."
6-65-42,"Rama, together with Lakshmana, is the root-cause for the attack on our city. If heis killed, all will be destroyed. Therefore, I shall kill that Rama in battle."
6-65-43,"While Kumbhakarna was speaking in that way, the demons made a very terrific noise,as though they were agitating the ocean."
6-65-44,"As that intelligent Kumbhakarna was sallying forth quickly for the battle, omens ofterrific patterns appeared on all sides."
6-65-45,"Clouds, ashy in colour like asses, combined with meteors and strokes of lightningappeared. Even the earth trembled, together with its oceans and forests."
6-65-46,"Jackals of terrific form howled with flaming morsels in their mouths and birdstwirled in circles from right to left."
6-65-47,"A vulture descended on the spike of Kumbhakarna, as he was sallying forth along theroad. His left eye twitched and his left arm throbbed."
6-65-48,"Then, a blazing meteor fell down with a dreadful noise. Even the sun becamelusterless and the wind was not blowing comfortably."
6-65-49,"Disregarding those great portents indicated, causing the hair to stand erect,Kumbhakarna on his part marched on, driven by the power of fate."
6-65-50,"Kumbhakarna, looking like a mountain, traversing the rampart with his feet alone,saw a wonderful army of monkeys, looking similar to a thick coverage of clouds."
6-65-51,"Seeing that Kumbhakarna, the excellent among demons, looking equal to a mountain,the monkeys then ran away to all directions, as clouds are driven away by the wind."
6-65-52,"Looking towards that highly fierce army of monkeys, running away to differentquarters, as a net-work of broken clouds, that Kumbhakarna with the hue of a black cloud, highlyrejoiced, repeatedly emitted a roar-like thunder."
6-65-53,"Hearing his terrific roar, similar to the rumbling of a cloud in the sky, many ofthose monkeys fell down on the ground, like Sal trees cut-up by the roots."
6-65-54,"Wielding a large iron rod for the destroyable of the enemies, that giganticKumbhakarna looked like Yama the lord of death armed with a rod of punishment, waiting upon him ashis attendant at the time of dissolution of the world and caused a great terrific fear to thetroops of monkeys."
6-66-1,"That mighty Kumbhakarna, with his colossal body resembling the peak of a mountain,having crossed the rampart, sallied forth from the city."
6-66-2,"Kumbhakarna emitted a roar, making the sea to reverberate, causing the mountains toquake and drowning the thunder-claps, as it were."
6-66-3,"Seeing that demons of terrific eyes who could not be destroyed either by Indra thelord of celestials or by Yama the lord of death or by Varuna the god of water, the monkeys ranaway."
6-66-4,"Seeing them running away, Angada the prince spoke to Nala, Neela, Gavaksha and themighty Kumuda as follows:"
6-66-5,"Where do you go, forgetting your own dignities as also nobilities of birth andtrembling with fear like common monkeys?"
6-66-6,"O auspicious monkeys! Please return! Why do you so fully guard your lives? Thisdemon is not competent for a combat. He is merely a great toy of terror."
6-66-7,"O monkeys! By our prowess, we shall destroy this giant toy produced by demons. Comeback!"
6-66-8,"Reconciling themselves with some difficulty, the monkeys, from all sides, assembledtogether at a place and snatching some trees, the monkeys for their part, towards thebattle-field."
6-66-9,"Like elephants in rut, those monkeys, having came back, hurriedly hit Kumbhakarna,very much enraged as they were."
6-66-10,"The mighty Kumbhakarna, though assaulted with lofty mountain-tops, rocks and treeswith blossoms at their ends, stood unshaken."
6-66-11,"Many rocks, fallen on his limbs, got burst into pieces. The trees, with blossoms attheir ends, were broken and fell shattered on the floor."
6-66-12,"Kumbhakarna too, very much enraged, crushed the ranks of monkeys though they weregreatly energetic, with his extreme exertion even as a rising fire would consume the woods."
6-66-13,"Many of the foremost among the monkeys lay on the ground, bathed in blood as theywere, fallen like trees with crimson flowers, when tossed up by the demon."
6-66-14,"Some monkeys, while jumping and running away, did not look back. Some fell in theocean. Some inhabited the sky."
6-66-15,"While that demon was killing some warriors of monkeys playfully, some others ranaway by the same route, by which they earlier crossed the ocean."
6-66-16,"While some monkeys becoming pale-faced due to fear, inhabited the mounds and the lowgrounds, some bears ascended the trees. Some escaped to a hill."
6-66-17,"Some were drowned in the ocean. Some had recourse into the caves. Some othersescaped. Some could not even stand stable on the ground. Some fell down. Some lied down, as thoughthey were dead."
6-66-18,"Seeing those monkeys disorderly retreated, Angada spoke these words, ""Stay. We shallcarry on the battle. Come back."""
6-66-19,"I do not catch sight of any place for you, who have retreated, even if you roamover the entire earth. Let all of you come back. Why do you safeguard your lives?"
6-66-20,"O valiant monkeys, moving without hindrances! Your wives, seeing you running awayleaving your weapos aside, will mock at you. It is indeed a death for those who lived well."
6-66-21,"All of us are born in distinguished races; which are well developed. Where to yougo frightened, like ordinary monkeys? As you are running away with fear, leaving all your valour,you are indeed unworthy of honour."
6-66-22,"Where did those boasting words of you melt away, in which you highly projectedyourself in front of the people just before coming for the battle?"
6-66-23,"The cowards, who survive even after being reproached, have to hear slanders fromthe people. Let the path trodden by the good people be followed. Let your fear be abandoned."
6-66-24,"If our longevity is short, we shall lie down, being killed by the enemies, on theearth and reach the realm of Brahma (residence of pious spirits), which is difficult to be attainedby bad warriors."
6-66-25,"O monkeys! We shall obtain glory by killing our enemies in battle or if killed onthe other hand, we shall enjoy the heaven, attained by the warriors."
6-66-26,"Coming face to face with Rama, Kumbhakarna will not go back alive, any more than amoth meeting a blazing fire."
6-66-27,"If we, in large numbers, who are intended to fight, are conquered by one personalone and if we protect our lives by running away, our glory will undergo a damage."
6-66-28,"Then, those fleeing monkeys spoke the following words, which were contemptible bythe warriors, to that valiant Angada, who was adorneed with golden armlets."
6-66-29,"For us, it is enough of this terrific battle with Kumbhakarna, the demon. It is notthe proper time to stay back but it is to time to go away. Life is indeed dear to us."
6-66-30,"Seeing that terrific Kumbhakarna coming with his dreadful eyes, all those commandersof monkey-troops, speaking words only thus far, scattered in all directions."
6-66-31,"Thereafter, with the coaxing words and inferential arguments by Angada, all thosefleeing commanders of monkeys turned back."
6-66-32,"Having been cheered up by the intellectual Angada, all those commanders of thearmy-troops stood awaiting his command."
6-66-33,"Rishabha, Sharabha, Mainda, Dhumra, Neela, Kumuda, sushena, Gavaksha, Rambha, Taraand more particularly Dvipada, Panasa and hanuma marched ahead very quickly, with their facesturned towards the battle."
6-67-1,"Hearing the words of Angada, all those large-bodied monkeys who came back, havingarrived at a firm resolution, were waiting for the battle."
6-67-2,"Restored to confidence by the words of the mighty Angada, those monkeys, whoseenergy was well-augmented and prowess well-elevated, restored to a thrill of rapture and as theywere determined to die, marched forward to fight. Ready to abandon their lives, they were engagedin a tumultuous battle."
6-67-3,"Lifting up trees and very large mountain-rocks, the large-bodied monkeys thereuponbriskly ran towards Kumbhakarna."
6-67-4,"The mighty and valiant Kumbhakarna, who got very much enraged, lifting a mace andfrightening his enemies, diffused them on all sides."
6-67-5,"Seven hundred, eight hundred and thousands of monkeys struck by Kumbhakarna, layscattered on the ground."
6-67-6,"That highly enraged Kumbhakarna, putting in his mount, (as many as) sixteen or eightor ten or even twenty or thirty monkeys by his hands and devouring them like. Garuda the mythicalbird devouring the serpents in lots, ran about the battle-field."
6-67-7,"Restored to confidence with difficulty, the monkeys assembling together from allsides, stood in the battle-front, with trees and rocks in their hands."
6-67-8,"Pulling out a mountain and looking like a hanging cloud, Dvivida the foremost amongthe monkeys, ran towards Kumbhakarna, who resembled a mountain-peak."
6-67-9,"Dvivida, springing up, hurled that mountain towards Kumbhakarna. Even withoutreaching the colossal bodied Kumbhakarna, it however fell on his army."
6-67-10,"That excellent mountain crushed the horses, elephants and the chariots. Anothermountain-top, when hurled, crushed the other demons."
6-67-11,"Struck by the jerk of the mountain, that great battle-field of demons, with itshorses and charioteers killed, became dampened with blood."
6-67-12,"The demons who fight from the chariots, with their terrific roar, at once discardedthe heads of the clamouring chiefs of monkeys, with their arrows, which were resembling the god ofdeath at the time of universal dissolution."
6-67-13,"Uprooting large trees, the mighty monkeys too began to destroy the chariots, horses,Camels and demons."
6-67-14,"Staying in the sky, Hanuma showered mountain-tops, rocks and various types of treeson Kumbhakarna's head."
6-67-15,"The mighty Kumbhakarna broken those mountain-tops and shattered the torrent of treeswith his spike."
6-67-16,"Then, taking the dreadful spike in his hand, Kumbhakarna ran towards that terrificarmy of monkeys. Taking a mountain-peak in his hands, Hanuma stood in front of the approachingKumbhakarna."
6-67-17,"The enraged Hanuma struck with violence Kumbhakarna, who was endowed with amagnificent body and looking like the most elevated mountain. Thus attacked by Hanuma, Kumbhakarnawas stumbled with a sprinkling of blood and with his limbs succulent with flesh."
6-67-18,"Holding firmly the spike, which was bright as lightning and looking like a blazingmountain-peak, Kumbhakarna struck Hanuma on his chest, as Guha (the son of Shiva) struck Kraunchamountain with his powerful javelin."
6-67-19,"That Hanuma, struck in his broad chest by the spike in that great combat, was highlyperturbed and while vomiting blood from his mouth, awfully roared like the sound of thunderousclouds at the time of dissolution of the world."
6-67-20,"Looking at the perturbed Hanuma, all the troops of demons then suddenly shouted withrejoice. The monkeys, on their part, felt restless and being oppressed with fear, ran away from thebattle-field."
6-67-21,"Thereupon, cheering up the army and stopping them, the mighty Neela then hurled amountain-top on the intellectual Kumbhakarna."
6-67-22,"Seeing that mountain-top befalling on him, Kumbhakarna then struck it with his fist.By that strike of the fist, that mountain-top was burst into pieces and fallen down on the ground,with sparks of fire and blaze."
6-67-23,"The five excellent monkeys, viz. Rishabha, Sharabha, Neela, Gavaksha andGandhamadana marched ahead quickly towards Kumbhakarna."
6-67-24,"Those five mighty monkeys struck the large-bodied Kumbhakarna from all sides, withcrags, trees, palms of their hands, feet and fists in battle."
6-67-25,"Perceiving those blows merely as the senses of touch, Kumbhakarna was not at allperturbed. He enfolded the greatly agitated Rishabha in his arms."
6-67-26,"Squeezed by Kumbhakarna's arms, the awful Rishabha, the foremost among the monkeys,fell down with blood coming out of his mouth."
6-67-27,"Then, in battle, the enraged Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Indra, beating Sharabha withhis fist and Neela with his knee, struck Gavaksha with a palm of his hand and struck Gandhamadanaviolently with his feet."
6-67-28,"Perturbed by the blows given by Kumbhakarna, those monkeys being moistened withblood, were bewildered and fell down on the ground, like chopped off Kimsuka trees."
6-67-29,"Seeing those mighty chief commanders of monkeys falling down on the ground,thousands of monkeys ran towards Kumbhakarna."
6-67-30,"All those champions of monkeys, looking like mountains, jumping up on Kumbhakarnawho was looking like a mountain, ascended him and bit him with their teeth."
6-67-31,"Those mighty armed excellent monkeys encountered that Kumbhakarna with their nails,teeth, fists and arms."
6-67-32,"Covered by thousands of monkeys that foremost among demons looking like a mountain,stood out in a crowd, as a hill overgrown with trees."
6-67-33,"Seizing all the monkeys with his arms, that mighty Kumbhakarna devoured them like anenraged Garuda the eagle devouring the serpents."
6-67-34,"Hurled by Kumbhakarna in his mouth which was looking like a hole in the earth, themonkeys again came out from his nostrils and ears."
6-67-35,"Kumbhakarna, the best among the demons, looking like a mountain, was very muchenraged and mutilated the monkeys angrily, before devouring them."
6-67-36,"Making the earth dampened with flesh and blood, that demon, like an excited fire atthe time of dissolution, strolled among that army of monkeys."
6-67-37,"Wielding a spike in his hand in the battle-front, the mighty Kumbhakarna shone likeIndra the lord of celestials wielding a thunderbolt in his hand and like Yama the god of deathwielding a noose in his hand."
6-67-38,"That Kumbhakarna scorched away that army of monkeys in the same way as the firescorches away the dried-up forests in summer."
6-67-39,"Those monkeys, without a commander, having their troops killed and terrified withfear they were being destroyed by Kumbhakarna, roared with rebellious voices."
6-67-40,"While Kumbhakarna was destroying them in many ways, the agitated monkeys soughtrefuge in Rama, with their distressed minds."
6-67-41,"Seeing the monkeys defeated in that great battle, Angada the son of Indra, ranrapidly towards Kumbhakarna."
6-67-42,"Taking a large mountain-top, Angada, roaring repeatedly and frightening all thedemons following Kumbhakarna's heels, hurled the mountain-top on Kumbhakarna's head."
6-67-43,"Struck on the head with that mountain, that Kumbhakarna, Indra's adversary, with agreat rage, was excited and then ran rapidly towards the wrathful Angada."
6-67-44,"Frightening all the monkeys with his great roar, the mighty Kumbhakarna hurled hisspike at Angada with anger."
6-67-45,"Knowing that the spike is going to fall on him, the mighty Angada, the chief of themonkeys, who was skilled in war-fare, avoided it with his alacrity."
6-67-46,"Jumping up Angada struck on Kumbhakarna's chest, with the palm of his hand. Thusbeaten with anger by him, Kumbhakarna resembling a mountain, became giddy."
6-67-47,"Getting his consciousness, that mighty demon threw down Angada by tightening hisfist with a scorn. Angada fell down unconscious."
6-67-48,"When that Angada the foremost among the monkeys fell down unconscious on the ground,Kumbhakarna ran towards Sugreeva, taking that spike in his hand."
6-67-49,"Then, seeing the mighty Kumbhakarna coming suddenly towards him, the valiantSugreeva, the king of the monkeys, sprang up all at once."
6-67-50,"Uplifting and tightly holding a mountain-top, the mighty Sugreeva ran towards thesturdy Kumbhakarna with speed."
6-67-51,"Seeing that Sugreeva coming rapidly towards him, Kumbhakarna, with all his limbsbraced, stood facing the king of monkeys."
6-67-52,"Seeing Kumbhakarna who stood devouring the monkeys and with his body smeared withthe blood of the monkeys, Sugreeva spoke as follows:"
6-67-53,"You struck down eminent monkeys. You have done a very difficult act. You havedevoured the armies. You obtained a great fame."
6-67-54,"Leave that army of monkeys. What will you do with these common beings? O demon! Youbear up against the falling of this one mountain being hurled by me."
6-67-55,"Hearing those words, endowed with strength and courage, spoken by Sugreeva,Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, spoke the following words:"
6-67-56,"O monkey! You are the grandson of Lord Brahma and even the son of Riksharaja(sprung from the yawn of Brahma) endowed with firmness and valour. Why do you roar?"
6-67-57,"Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, Sugreeva, firmly holding the mountain, hurled itquickly on him. He struck Kumbhakarna's chest by that mountain, which was as strong enough asIndra's thunderbolt."
6-67-58,"Soon after falling on his broad chest, that mountain was crushed to pieces. Then,the monkeys were suddenly distressed. The troops of demons roared with rejoice."
6-67-59,"Struck by the mountain-top, that Kumbhakarna was enraged and roared with his mouthwide open with anger. Holding firmly the spike, which was emitting a flash of lightning, he hurledit to kill Sugreeva, the king of monkeys and bears."
6-67-60,"Hanuma, jumping up and holding with his arms that sharp spike, furnished with goldenwreaths, and propelled by Kumbhakarna's arms, wreaths, and smashed it rapidly."
6-67-61,"Then, the rejoiced Hanuma, placing on his knee, that large spike made of ironweighing twenty thousand Tulas, broke it."
6-67-62,"Seeing Hanuma breaking the spike, that army of monkeys was rejoiced, roared severaltimes and came back quickly from all quarters."
6-67-63,"Then, the frightened Kumbhakarna became down-cast. Those monkeys were rejoiced andmade a lion's roar. Seeing the fate of spike in such a broken condition, they adored Hanuma."
6-67-64,"Seeing that spike broken in that way, that mighty Kumbhakarna was enraged. Uprootinga crest from Malaya mountain standing in the vicinity of Lanka and approaching Sugreeva, he struckhim with it."
6-67-65,"Struck by the mountain-top in battle, that Sugreeva fell unconscious on the ground.Seeing him falling unconscious on the ground in battle, the demons wee exceedingly pleased andcried out loudly."
6-67-66,"Seizing hold of that Sugreeva having wonderful and terrific prowess in battle, thatKumbhakarna took him away, as an impetuous wind takes away a cloud."
6-67-67,"Lifting up Sugreeva appearing like a huge cloud in the battle-field and marchingforward, Kumbhakarna shone like Mount Meru, distinguished by its very high and formidable peak."
6-67-68,"Then, being praised in the battle-field by the demons for having seized hold ofSugreeva and hearing the sounds of the celestials who were wondering at the seizure of Sugreeva,Kumbhakarna the valiant chief of demons, sallied forth."
6-67-69,"While taking away that Sugreeva looking like Indra, Kumbhakarna the adversary ofIndra and having the prowess of Indra, thought, ""If he is killed, all this army including Rama getsdestroyed."""
6-67-70,"Seeing the army of monkeys running away hither and thither and Sgureeva the monkeyeven being taken away by Kumbhakarna, the intellectual Hanuma, the son of wind-god thought asfollows:"
6-67-71,"While Sugreeva is being taken away in this way, what is to be done by me? I shallcertainly do that which is justifiable to be done by me. Growing to the size of a mountain, I shalldestroy this Kumbhakarna."
6-67-72,"Let all the monkeys be delighted while Sugreeva the king of monkeys is liberatedand the mighty Kumbhakarna, with his body crumbled by the blows of my fists, killed by me inbattle."
6-67-73,"Even otherwise, this Sugreeva can win the freedom himself despite he is taken awayby celestials including demons and serpent-demons."
6-67-74,"I think Sugreeva is not yet conscious of his self, as Kumbhakarna struck him withthe blow of a mountain in the battle."
6-67-75,"Regaining his consciousness within a moment in this great battle, this Sugreevawill do what is good for himself and for his monkeys."
6-67-76,"If I liberate this great-souled Sugreeva, there will be a painful dislike for himand a perpetual in fame."
6-67-77,"'Therefore, I shall wait for a while, for the king to show his prowess. Meanwhile, Ishall cheer up the scattered army of monkeys."""
6-67-78,"Thinking in this way, Hanuma the son of wind-god, then again brought firmness to thelarge army of monkeys."
6-67-79,"Taking that Sugreeva who was throbbing, that kumbhakarna entered the City of Lanka,where he was greatly revered with showers of foremost flowers by the citizens staying in celestialcars, streets, houses and gate-ways of temples."
6-67-80,"Sprinkled by those showers of pop-corn and fragrant waters and due to the coolnessof the royal roads, the mighty Sugreeva gradually regained his consciousness."
6-67-81,"The great souled Sugreeva, who was interposed between Kumbhakarna's shoulders,regaining his consciousness with great difficulty and observing the royal highway of the city,repeatedly thought (as follows):"
6-67-82,"Having been captivated in this way, what should I do now? I have to do a proper actnow which is desirable and beneficial to the monkeys."
6-67-83,"Thus thinking, Sugreeva tore asunder Kumbhakarna's ears by his nails as also nose byhis teeth and ribs by his feet."
6-67-84,"Torn asunder with teeth and nails by Sugreeva, that Kumbhakarna with his ears andnose deprived and his limbs moistened with blood, was subdued with rage, threw Sugreeva down on thefloor and crushed him."
6-67-85,"Crushed down on the floor by that terrific Kumbhakarna and struck by the demons,Sugreeva moved with speed like a ball towards the sky and got united with Rama."
6-67-86,"Bereft of his ears and nose, the mighty Kumbhakarna, pouring out blood, shone like amountain with its streaming cascades."
6-67-87,"Kumbhakarna the demon and the brother of Ravana, having his large body bathed inblood, frightful in appearance, vomiting blood with rage, and looking like a mound of blackantimony shone akin to a cloud with an evening-twilight. With his face directed towards thebattle-front, Kumbhakarna the terrific demon made up his mind to continue his combat."
6-67-88,"After the departure of Sugreeva, Kumbhakarna the adversary of Indra, with a rage,marched ahead quickly for the battle. Finding out that he is then without any weapon, the dreadfulKumbhakarna got possession of a hammer-like weapon."
6-67-89,"Starting from the city quickly, that mighty Kumbhakarna then devoured that huge armyof monkeys in battle, like the devour of people by the augmented fire at the time of dissolution ofthe world."
6-67-90,"Penetrating that huge army of monkeys, Kumbhakarna who was greedily desirous offlesh and blood in hunger, due to his deep bewilderment in battle, ate away even the demons,monkeys, devils and bears. He devoured the principal monkeys just as the death devours people atthe time of the end of the world."
6-67-91,"The enraged Kumbhakarna, quickly taking with his single hand, the monkeys anddemons, in one's two's, three's or in many and hurled them into his mouth"
6-67-92,"Struck with mountain-peaks, by the monkeys, the mighty Kumbhakarna, then, gushingforth his flesh and blood, devoured the monkeys."
6-67-93,"Thereupon, those monkeys, who were being devoured, sought Rama as their refuge. Thevery much enraged Kumbhakarna, while eating away the monkeys, marched forward."
6-67-94,"Grasping a hundred, a seven, an eight, a twenty and a thirty with his arms,Kumbhakarna was devouring the monkeys and running about in the battle-field."
6-67-95,"Having his entire body besmeared with flesh, marrow and blood together with wreathsof tangled viscera hung over his ears, the demon with his very sharp teeth, rained spikes on themonkeys, like Yama, the god of death, risen to power at the end of the world-cycle."
6-67-96,"Immediately, Lakshmana the son of Sumitra, the annihilator of the foe's army andconqueror of the cities of adversaries, commenced the battle with a rage."
6-67-97,"The valiant Lakshmana pierced seven arrows into the body of Kumbhakarna. He tooksome more arrows and released them too."
6-67-98,"Tormented by that weapon of Lakshmana, that demon destroyed it completely.Thereupon, the aggressive Lakshmana was enraged."
6-67-99,"Then, Lakshmana covered the shining and charming golden armour of Kumbhakarna withhis arrows, even as the wind would make an evening-twilight cloud completely disappear."
6-67-100,"Kumbhakarna, looking like a mound of collyrium, tormented by the arrows, decked withgold, shone like the radiant sun with its rays screened by clouds."
6-67-101,"Then, that terrific demon, with a thunderous noise of multiple clouds, spoke thefollowing words disrespectfully to Lakshmana."
6-67-102,"You declared your heroism fearlessly in battle, by attacking me, who has conqueredeven the lord of death effortlessly in a combat."
6-67-103,"Anyone who even stands before me, the god of death, holding forth a weapon in agreat battle here, is venerable. What to tell about a person who bestows battle on me?"
6-67-104,"Even the powerful Indra, the lord of celestials, who mounted Airavata the elephantand accompanied by all celestials, did not ever stand before me in battle."
6-67-105,"O Lakshmana! Today, I am gratified by your strength and abilities. Taking leave ofyou, I desire to march forward towards Rama."
6-67-106,"Because I have been gratified by you by way of your ability, strength and firmnessin battle, I for my part desire to kill Rama alone, for when he is killed, all the army will bekilled."
6-67-107,"When Rama is killed by me battle here, I will make my army to fight with others whoremain on the battle filled and destroy them."
6-67-108,"To that demon in battle, who has given his opinion thus, abounding in enology,Lakshmana as though bursting with laughter, spoke the following extremely terrific words:"
6-67-109,"O brave demon! You are telling that while you show your prowess, the heroes likeIndra and others feel unbearable; it is true. Just now, I have seen your prowess. But, see Rama theson of Dasaratha, standing here unmoving like a mountain."
6-67-110,"Hearing in this manner, that mighty Kumbhakarna the demon, brushing aside Lakshmanaand crossing him, ran, as though he is causing an earth-quake, towards Rama."
6-67-111,"Thereupon, Rama, the son of Dasaratha, employing a spell (used to charm arrows)called Raudra, discharged sharp arrows into Kumbhakarna's chest."
6-67-112,"Flames of fire mixed with particles of charcoal came forth from the face ofKumbhakarna, who was thus struck and who was running quickly towards Rama."
6-67-113,"That foremost among demons, struck by Rama's arrow, roaring terribly with rage,making the monkeys to run away in battle, ran himself towards Rama."
6-67-114,"Those arrows, adorned with peacock's plumes, penetrated into his chest. His macedropped off from his hand and fell on the ground."
6-67-115,"All his weapons fell scattered on the ground. Considering himself as weaponless,that mighty Kumbhakarna then fought fiercely with his fists and arms."
6-67-116,"That Kumbhakarna, with his body struck fiercely by arrows and bathed in blood,poured forth blood, even as a mountain would pour forth a cascade."
6-67-117,"With a terrific wrath, he felt insensible with blood. He roamed about, devouring themonkeys, demons and bears."
6-67-118,"Then, that Kumbhakarna, comparable to Yama the god of death, of terrific prowess andstrength, firmly holding a fearful mountain-peak, hurled it towards Rama."
6-67-119,"Wile that mountain peak was still on its way and had not yet reached him Rama,fixing together his well-known bow and arrows, split the mountain in the middle, with sevenstraight-going arrows."
6-67-120,"Then, Rama, the virtuous man and the elder brother of Bharata, split the largemountain-peak which was hurled by Kumbhakarna at that time, with his variegated arrows made ofgold."
6-67-121,"That mountain-peak, in the form of a peak of Mount Meru, as if shining withsplendour, while falling, caused two hundred monkeys to fall."
6-67-122,"At that time, considering various strategies appropriate for killing Kumbhakarna,the righteous Lakshmana spoke to Rama as follows:"
6-67-123,"O king! He is not able to recognize who the monkeys are and who the demons are.Intoxicated with the smell of blood, he is devouring his own persons and also others."
6-67-124,"Let the foremost of monkeys ascend well upon his body from all sides. Following thecommanders of their troops, let the monkey-leaders stand, surrounding him."
6-67-125,"If we do in that way, that evil-minded demon would be harassed by the huge weight,making him to crawl on the floor and cannot kill the other monkeys."
6-67-126,"Hearing those words of that intelligent Lakshmana, those monkeys were rejoiced andmounted on the body of Kumbhakarna."
6-67-127,"Kumbhakarna, when climbed upon by the monkeys, was enraged and shook them off withviolence, as a vicious elephant would shake off its mahout."
6-67-128,"Seeing the monkeys shaken down, Rama on his part understanding that he was enraged,jumped up speedily towards the demon and took an excellent bow."
6-67-129,"The heroic Rama, enraged with red-hot eyes, as though he was scorching the enemywith his looks, walked with speed, causing delight to all the leaders of the monkey-troops, whowere tormented with the fear of Kumbhakarna and quickly marched towards the demon."
6-67-130,"Taking in his hand, a terrific bow with a firmly fastened cord looking like a snakeand looking variegated with its crust of gold, with a quiver full of excellent arrows fastened onhis back and fully restoring the monkeys to confidence, that Rama quickly marched forward."
6-67-131,"That mighty and heroic Rama, who was highly unconquerable, accompanied by Lakshmana,duly marched forward, surrounded by those troops of monkeys."
6-67-132,"The mighty Rama saw the powerful Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of enemies, wearing acrown and his eyes blood-red with anger."
6-67-133,"Rama saw the angry Kumbhakarna, chasing all, like the mythical elephant guarding oneof the quarters, searching for the monkeys, enraged as he was and surrounded by the demons."
6-67-134,"Rama saw that Kumbhakarna, looking like Vindhya and Mandara mountains, adorned witharmlets of gold, emitting blood from his mouth and appearing as a rising rainy cloud."
6-67-135,"Rama saw that Kumbhakarna, who was licking the corners of his mouth which werebathed in blood, all they way trampling the monkeys and resembling Yama in the form ofall-destroying time."
6-67-136,"Seeing that Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, having a splendour of blazing fire,Rama, the excellent of men, then stretched his bow."
6-67-137,"Enraged by the twang of Rama's bow, Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, nottolerating that sound, ran towards Rama."
6-67-138,"Thereupon, Rama spoke to the dashing Kumbhakarna looking like a cloud driven by thewind, whose arms were like the coils of Vasuki (the king of serpents) and appearing like a mountainin the battle-field (as follows):"
6-67-139,"O leader of the demons! Come on. Do not regret. I sand, wielding a bow in my hand.Know me to be the annihilator of the race of demons. You will be dead within a moment."
6-67-140,"Coming to know that he was Rama, Kumbhakarna laughed in a rebellious tone and ran upenraged towards the monkeys, driving them away in the battle-field."
6-67-141,"That Kumbhakarna of great splendour, as though bursting the hearts of all themonkeys, laughed unnaturally as also awfully and spoke the following words to Rama:"
6-67-142,"'I am neither to be considered as Viradha nor Kabandha nor Khara nor Vali norMaricha. It is Kumbhakarna who arrived here."""
6-67-143,"See my large terrific hammer, completely made of iron. By it, the celestials andthe demons were conquered by me before."
6-67-144,"You need not treat me with contempt, as I am deprived of my ear and nose. To me,there is no agony even indeed a little, for having lost the ear and the nose."
6-67-145,"O faultless excellent Rama born in Ikshavaku dynasty! Show your prowess on mylimbs. After seeing your strength and prowess, I will be devouring you."
6-67-146,"Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, that Rama released plumed arrows. Even afterstruck by them, whose speed was equal to a thunderbolt, that demon was neither shaken norafflicted."
6-67-147,"Those arrows, which chopped off the Sala trees and killed Vali the foremost ofmonkeys, could not torment Kumbhakarna's body which was like a thunderbolt."
6-67-148,"Sucking those arrows with his body, as mountains suck up torments of water, thatKumbhakarna, flourishing his hammer with terrible speed, hindered the tremendous speed of Rama'sarrows."
6-67-149,"Then, flourishing that hammer which was smeared with blood and which can frightenthe great army of celestials, in terrific speed, that demon scared away the army of monkeys."
6-67-150,"Thereupon, taking a great missile called Vayavya, Rama hurled it on the demon. Bythat weapon, he chopped off Kumbhakarna's arm along with the hammer. With his arm chopped off,Kumbhakarna roared tumultuously."
6-67-151,"That Kumbhakarna's arm, identical to a mountain-peak, which was chopped off byRama's arrow, fell along with the hammer on that army of Sugreeva and killed that regiment ofmonkeys."
6-67-152,"Those monkeys who had escaped being broken and slain by that arm, though dejectedwith their tormented limbs and taking recourse to the sides, witnessed a highly terrific encounterbetween Rama and Kumbhakarna."
6-67-153,"Having an arm chopped off by the arrow like a mountain-peak chopped off by agigantic sword, that Kumbhakarna with his another arm, pulled up a tree by its roots and then rantowards Rama the lord of men in that battle-front."
6-67-154,"By his arrow, which was made variegated by gold and furnished with a mystic spell ofIndra used for charming it, Rama chopped off Kumbhakarna's remaining arm, appearing like the coilof a serpent along with his uprooted palm-tree."
6-67-155,"That Kumbhakarna's arm, which appeared like a hill, was chopped off and fell down onthe ground. Wallowing hither and thither, it dashed with trees, rocks, monkeys and demons."
6-67-156,"Seeing Kumbhakarna with his arms chopped off, abruptly with a roar, coming upon himand taking two sharp arrows with a shape of a half-moon each, Rama chopped off the feet of thedemon in that battle."
6-67-157,"Creating a resound everywhere in all directions, even in hill-caves, in the greatocean, in Lanka as also in the armies of monkeys and demons, Kumbhakarna's feet fell down."
6-67-158,"Widely opening his mouth like the mouth of a submarine fire and roaring, Kumbhakarnawhose arms and feet were cut off, ran (with thighs) quickly towards Rama, like Rahu theseizer-demon going to seize the moon in the sky."
6-67-159,"Rama filled up Kumbhakarna's mouth with sharply pointed arrows, having shaftscovered with gold. With his mouth full of arrows, Kumbhakarna was unable to speak. He moaned withdifficulty and even became unconscious."
6-67-160,"Thereupon, that Rama got hold of an arrow spelled with a missile presided over byIndra the lord of celestials, effulgent as sun's rays, resembling the rod of Brahma the lord ofcreation as also the destructive Kala, the Time-Spirit, and having its speed equal to the wind."
6-67-161,"Rama discharged against the demon, that arrow, whose shaft was inlaid with diamondsand gold, which was shining as the dazzling sun and fire set ablaze, and which vied with the speedof Indra's thunderbolt."
6-67-162,"That arrow, propelled by Rama's arm, with a terrific aspect like the smokeless fire,having a formidable energy of Indra's thunderbolt and illuminating the ten quarters with its ownsplendour, proceeded forward."
6-67-163,"That Rama slashed Kumbhakarna's head, which was looking like a huge mountain-peak,having well-rounded tusks and with charming and quivering ear-rings, as like Indra the destroyer ofstrong-holds, in the past, chopped off the head of Vritra, the demon of darkness and drought."
6-67-164,"The large Kumbhakarna's head, adorned with ear-rings, shone like the moon being inthe middle, when the constellation, Punarvasu (presided over by Aditi the mother of gods andconsisting of twin-stars) has risen at the night."
6-67-165,"That demon's head, equal in size to a mountain, struck by Rama's arrow, fell down.It broke the buildings on the king's high-way and their gates as also threw down that highrampart."
6-67-166,"Then, that colossal demon of a great splendour fell into the sea. It crushed theprincipal alligators, beautiful fishes as also snakes and entered the bowels of the earth."
6-67-167,"While that mighty Kumbhakarna, the enemy of brahmanas and celestials was killed inbattle, the earth and mountains shook. Even the celestials raised a tumultuous roar with joy."
6-67-168,"Then, saints of the celestial class, great sages*, serpents, gods, genii, Suparnas(a class of bird-like beings of a semi-divine character), Guhyakas (another class of demi-gods),including troops of Yakshas and Gandharvas (celestial musicians) standing in the sky, were rejoicedat Rama's prowess."
6-67-169,"Thereupon, at the mere sight of Rama, Ravana's relatives were perturbed at thekilling of Ravana of great intelligence and loudly roared, as elephants roar at the sight of alion."
6-67-170,"Having destroyed Kumbhakarna in battle, that Rama shone in the midst of the army ofmonkeys, in the same way as the sun shines in the midst of the celestial world, having destroyeddarkness, duly getting delivered from the mouth of Rahu."
6-67-171,"Several monkeys were highly rejoiced, with their faces flowing like full-blownlotuses. They adored Rama, who was dangerous to be attacked and as a beloved young man, killed anenemy possessing a terrible strength."
6-67-172,"By killing Kumbhakarna, who tormented the army of celestials and who was notdefeated at any time in great battles, Rama was rejoiced in the same way as Indra the lord ofcelestials was rejoiced in killing Vritra, the great demon."
6-68-1,"Seeing that the great-souled Rama killed Kumbhakarna, the demons reported the matterto Ravana, the king of demons (as follows):"
6-68-2,"O king! That Kumbhakarna, looking like Yama the god of death, driving away the armyof monkeys and devouring some monkeys, met with death, the time's act."
6-68-3,"Showing his prowess for a moment, Kumbhakarna your brother, was extinguished by thefiery energy of Rama. Injured by Rama's arrows, Kumbhakarna who was looking like a mountain becamean ugly mass, with his body discharging blood, as his nose and ears were cut off, resembling a treescorched by a forest-fire, with his trunk half-submerged in a terribly looking sea and obstructingthe main gate of Lanka."
6-68-4,"Hearing that the mighty Kumbhakarna was killed in battle, Ravana was tormented withgrief and fell down, fainted."
6-68-5,"Hearing that his paternal uncle was killed; Devantaka, Narantaka, Trishira andAtikaya were afflicted with sorrow and wept."
6-68-6,"Hearing that Kumbhakarna, their brother was killed by Rama, who was unwary in hisactions, Mahodara and Mahaparshva (step-brothers of Kumbhakarna) were overcome with grief."
6-68-7,"Then, recovering his consciousness with difficulty, distressed as he was for thekilling of Kumbhakarna and perplexed in mind, Ravana the foremost of demons, lamented (asfollows):"
6-68-8,"Alas! O hero, destroying the pride of enemies! O mighty Kumbhakarna! Leaving mebehind, you have gone by divine will to the abode of Yama the lord of death."
6-68-9,"O mighty Kumbhakarna! Where are you going alone, leaving me behind, after havingtormented the army of enemies and without taking away the thorn of grief from relatives andme."
6-68-10,"Indeed I shall no longer live now, that this right hand of mine, taking refuge onwhen I had no fear of celestials and ogres, has fallen down."
6-68-11,"How such a hero, who destroyed the pride of celestials and demons, as also who wasan image of fire that was to destroy the world, was killed by Rama today in battle?"
6-68-12,"Having been afflicted by Rama's arrows, how are you, whom not even a clash of athunder-bolt ever caused any fall, falling now insensibly on the earth's surface?"
6-68-13,"Seeing you killed in battle, these troops of celestials and sages, standing in thesky, are shouting with rejoice."
6-68-14,"It is doubly sure that the monkeys, having achieved their purpose, will be rejoicedand now itself will ascend the inaccessible door-ways of Lanka here from all sides."
6-68-15,"I have nothing to do with a kingdom and what shall I do with Seetha? I have nointention to live, bereft of Kumbhakarna."
6-68-16,"If I cannot kill Rama, who killed my brother, in battle, I would indeed preferdeath, but in no case this useless life which has no meaning."
6-68-17,"Now itself, I will go to that place, where my younger brother is there. I do notwish to live even for a moment, after abandoning my brothers."
6-68-18,"Seeing me, who did harm to them in the past, the celestials will indeed mock me. OKumbhakarna! Now that you are dead, how can I conquer Indra the lord of celestials?"
6-68-19,"Those words of that great-souled Vibhishana, which I did not accept due toignorance, have come true."
6-68-20,"Ever since this cruel end of Kumbhakarna and Prahasta has happened, I am feelingshameful."
6-68-21,"Since that venerable Vibhishana, my pious brother was banished by me, this bitterfruit of that painful deed has come to me."
6-68-22,"Having thus lamented very much piteously in various ways on coming to know thatKumbhakarna, his younger brother and the enemy of Indra having been killed, Ravana the ten-headeddemon, whose inner feelings were agitated, even sank down, extremely disturbed."
6-69-1,"Hearing the words of the evil-minded Ravana, who was thus lamenting, as he wasovercome with grief, Trishira (one of his sons) spoke as follows:"
6-69-2,"Truly in such a manner, the highly valiant Kumbhakarna, (the middle of our fatherand uncles) has been killed. But good persons like you do not lament as you are doing, O king!"
6-69-3,"O Lord! You are capable of conquering even the three worlds. Why are you, as such,lamenting about yourself, as a common person?"
6-69-4,"You do continue to have a javelin given by Brahma, an armour, a bow and an arrowtogether with a chariot yoked to a thousand donkeys, emitting a sound resembling the rumbling of acloud."
6-69-5,"The celestials and giants were indeed destroyed several times by you with yourvarious types of weapons. As such, you can punish Rama, when endowed with all weapons."
6-69-6,"You stay on, O monarch! I will set out and eradicate your enemies in battle, asGaruda the eagle eradicates the serpents."
6-69-7,"Beaten down by me, as Shambara by Indra and Naraka* by Vishnu, I will lay down Ramatoday in battle."
6-69-8,"Hearing the words of Trishira, Ravana the king of demons considered himself asthough born anew, after being summoned by Death."
6-69-9,"Hearing the words of Trishira, Devantaka, Narantaka and the energetic Atikaya wererejoiced of war."
6-69-10,"Then, the brave Ravana's sons, whose prowess was equal to Indra and the foremost ofdemons, roared asserting their superiority saying ""I will lead, I will lead!"""
6-69-11,"All of them wee capable of passing through the sky. All were skilled in magic. Allhad humbled the pride of gods. All were fierce in battle."
6-69-12,"All were endowed with great strength. All were widely renowned. All were such as hadnever been heard of having been conquered by celestials or Gandharvas or Kinnaras or large serpentswhile encountering a battle."
6-69-13,"All the demons were valiant ones, well-versed in weaponry. All were skilled inwar-fare. All were greatly knowledgeable and all had obtained boons."
6-69-14,"That Ravana the king, surrounded by his sons, who were radiant as the sun and whotormented the strength and fortune of the enemies, shone like Indra surrounded by celestials whocan destroy the pride of gigantic demons."
6-69-15,"Embracing his sons, embellishing them with ornaments and blessing them profusely,Ravana sent them to battle."
6-69-16,"For the defense of his sons, Ravana sent Yuddhonmatta and Matta (better known asMahodara and Mahaparshva), his brothers to the battle."
6-69-17,"Those demons with colossal bodies, paid obeisance (by circumambulating) to Ravana(who caused the people to cry in terror) and departed."
6-69-18,"Anointing their bodies with all types of herbs and perfumes, those six mighty andexcellent demons went away, eager to fight."
6-69-19,"Trishira, Atikaya, Devantaka, Narantaka, Mahodara and Mahaparshva, under the cloutof destiny; set out for the battle."
6-69-20,"Thereupon, Mahodara mounted an elephant called Sudarshana, like unto a dark-cloudand born in Airavata-race."
6-69-21,"That Mahodara, adorned with quivers, endowed with all types of armoury and mountingthe elephant, shone like the sun on the peak of Ashtachala mountain."
6-69-22,"Trishira, the son of Ravana, ascended an exquisite chariot, yoked to excellenthorses and filled with all types of armoury."
6-69-23,"Trishira, wielding a bow and mounting the chariot, shone like a cloud withglittering meteors, illuminations and a rain-bow."
6-69-24,"That Trishira with three diadems in that exquisite chariot, stood out like MountHimavat, the king of mountains with its three golden hills."
6-69-25,"Then, Atikaya, having very fiery energy, the son of Ravana and the foremost amongthe wielders of bow, mounted an excellent chariot."
6-69-26,"Atikaya mounted that chariot, having first-rate wheels and axles, well-yoked, havinga good carriage and pole, filled with quivers and bows and flashingly full of missiles, swords andmaces."
6-69-27,"He was radiant with his diadem, shining in brilliant gold and other ornaments, likeMount Meru, causing to shine with its splendours (by the sun)."
6-69-28,"In that chariot, Atikaya that mighty prince, surrounded by the foremost of demons,shone like Indra surrounded by celestials."
6-69-29,"Narantaka mounted a white gigantic horse, similar to Uchchaishrava (the mount ofIndra), adorned with gold ornaments and as swift as thought."
6-69-30,"Narantaka, holding a javelin, which was resplendent like a meteor, appeared shining,like Guha (the offspring of Shiva) holding a spear and riding a beautiful peacock."
6-69-31,"Devantaka, holding a glided iron-bar, marched ahead, resembling an incarnation ofVishnu holding Mandara-mountain in his arms."
6-69-32,"Mahaparshva, possessing a great splendour and vigour and wielding a mace in his armin battle, looked like Kubera the lord of wealth."
6-69-33,"Those distinguished demons set out from. Lanka, like the gods leaving Amaravati.Mighty demons, holding excellent weaponry, accompanied them, mounting on elephants, horses andchariots making sounds of rumbling clouds."
6-69-34,"Those mighty princes, having sun's brilliance, wearing diadems and possessed ofprosperity, shone like glowing planets in the sky."
6-69-35,"The row of auspicious attire worn by them, shone like an autumnal cloud or like aflock of cranes in the sky."
6-69-36,"Determined either to die or to vanquish their enemies, those valiant demons wentforward, thus making their courageous resolve, eager to fight."
6-69-37,"Those mighty demons set out with a mad conception of war, roared and made areverberatory sound, took up arrows and dispatched them."
6-69-38,"The earth trembled as it were, by their battle-cries and clapping of arms. The skyappeared breached, by the lion's roars of the demons."
6-69-39,"Those mighty leaders of demons, having set out, were delighted to see the army ofmonkeys having uplifted rocks as their weapons."
6-69-40,"The mighty monkeys too saw that army of demons, which appeared like a black cloudbut blazing like fire and sun on all sides, abounding with elephants, horses and chariots, made toresound with hundreds of small bells and wielding well-raised great weaponry."
6-69-41,"Seeing that army which arrived and as they got the target for their fight, themonkeys, having the great mountains uplifted, roared again and again. The monkeys, not toleratingthe demons, thus shouted, standing opposite to them."
6-69-42,"Hearing the enhanced noise of the leaders of the army of monkeys, the troops ofdemons who were terrible in might, not tolerating the rejoice of the enemies, then made a noisemore terribly."
6-69-43,"Entering that terrific army of demons, those monkey-leaders, with their raisedmountains, roamed about like mountains with their peaks."
6-69-44,"Some monkeys entering the sky and some others enraged, staying on earth with treesand rocks as their weapons, wandered among the army of demons."
6-69-45,"The foremost among the monkeys, holding trees, having extensive branches, roamedabout in the battle-field. That battle-front, filled with demons and monkeys, looked terrific."
6-69-46,"Those monkeys, of terrific prowess, though impeded by a flood of arrows, initiated amatchless rain of trees, rocks and mountains."
6-69-47,"In the battle, the demons and the monkeys made a noise of lion's roars. The monkeyspounded the demons with rocks."
6-69-48,"The enraged monkeys killed demons wearing armours and ornaments. Some killed valiantdemons, sitting or standing in chariots and also those demons mounted on elephants and horses."
6-69-49,"Valiant monkeys struck the demons vehemently. Those foremost of demons trembled, astheir bodies were attacked by mountain-peaks and blows of fists, down and roared."
6-69-50,"Those demons also pierced the foremost of monkeys with sharp arrows, striking themwith spears mallets, swords, javelins and lances."
6-69-51,"There, the monkeys and demons having their limbs smeared with the blood of theirfoes, mowed each other with a desire to conquer each other."
6-69-52,"Thereupon, within an instant, the battle-field became dampened with blood andcovered by the mountains and swords thrown by the monkeys and demons."
6-69-53,"Then the battle-field became filled with dead bodies of demons, who had an ardentpassion for battle, having their colossal bodies devastated and scattered all over."
6-69-54,"The demons, already thrown down and still being thrown down, with their spearsbroken by the monkeys at that time, approached the monkeys and carried out a wonderful combat withtheir limbs, arms and legs."
6-69-55,"Those foremost of demons struck the monkeys with their own corpses and the monkeysalso struck the titans with their own dead bodies."
6-69-56,"Then, grabbing the rocks and mountains, those titans struck the monkeys with them.The apes too, snatching away their weapons, struck the titans."
6-69-57,"The monkeys and demons fractured each other with crags and made a noise with lion'sroars."
6-69-58,"The titans, having their armours broken, as struck by the apes, emitted blood atthat place, like trees oozing their sap."
6-69-59,"Some monkeys in the battle-front destroyed chariot with chariots, elephants with thevery elephants and horse by the very horses."
6-69-60,"The titans broke the trees and rocks of monkey-chiefs with their sharp arrows withtheir hoe-shaped head, those arrows with crescent-shaped head and those with spear-like head."
6-69-61,"The battle-field, filled with those mountains, broken trees and dead bodies of apesand titans, became difficult to be traversed."
6-69-62,"Reaching the battle-field and abandoning their fear, all those monkeys, with theirthrilling martial arts full of pride, nay, who were having various weapons (like trees, rocks,teeth and nails) and unrepressed in spirit, carried out battle with the demons."
6-69-63,"Seeing the monkeys rejoicing in that tumultuous battle which commenced and thedemons falling down, the great sages and troop of celestials emitted shouts of triumph."
6-69-64,"Meanwhile, mounting on a horse having speed equal to the wind, and taking a barbedjavelin, Narantaka entered the terrific army of monkeys, as a fish entering the ocean."
6-69-65,"That valiant and mighty Narantaka, the enemy of Indra, single-handedly within aninstant, rent asunder seven hundred monkeys with that shining javelin and killed that army of theforemost of monkeys."
6-69-66,"Vidyadharas, the super natural beings and great sages, saw the mighty Narantaka,seated on the back of a horse and hacking a path way for himself through the army of monkeys."
6-69-67,"His path-way was covered with a mire of flesh and blood, along with heaps offallen-down dead-bodes of monkeys, looking like hills."
6-69-68,"Whenever the foremost of the monkeys thought of showing their valour, so oftenNarantaka overtook and cleaved them."
6-69-69,"He burn away the army of monkeys, as the fire burns away the forests. Even beforethe monkeys get time to uplift the trees and mountains, the javelin struck them and they fell down,as mountains riven by lightning."
6-69-70,"That mighty Narantaka, the destroyer of men, roamed in all directions in thebattle-field, holding up his shiny javelin, ravaging in all directions like the wind ravaging theearth in a rainy season."
6-69-71,"Narantaka, a single demon, equal to so many demons, struck the armies of mokeys withhis javelin, having the sun's splendour and they fell down on the earth."
6-69-72,"Narantaka, a single demon, equal to so many demons, struck the armies of mokeys withhis javelin, having the sun's splendour and they fell down on the earth."
6-69-73,"Those monkeys were unable to tolerate the down-onslaught of the javelin, which wassimilar to the striking of a thunderbolt and they shouted with a great uproar."
6-69-74,"The images of the falling monkeys were flashing like those of falling mountains,with their peaks shattered by a thunderbolt."
6-69-75,"Those great-souled and the foremost of monkeys, who were earlier thrown down byKumbhakarna, regained their self and approached Sugreeva."
6-69-76,"That Sugreeva, while looking on, saw the army of monkeys running away hither andthither, as they were tormented of the fear of Narantaka."
6-69-77,"To that Sugreeva who was seeing his army running away, Narantaka appeared, comingseated on the back of a horse, holding a javelin in his hand."
6-69-78,"After seeing Narantaka, the vastly splendoured Sugreeva, the king of monkeys spokethus, to Angada, the valiant prince, having a prowess equal to Indra's (as follows):"
6-69-79,"Go out and quickly detach the lives of this valiant demon, who is riding a horseand consuming the army of his enemies."
6-69-80,"Hearing the words of Sugreeva his sovereign, that valiant Angada then came bouncingfrom his army, as the sun coming out of a cloud."
6-69-81,"Angada the excellent of monkeys, resembling a rocky mass, wearing bracelets on hisupper arms, looked brilliant like a mountain with its metallic streaks."
6-69-82,"Angada the son of Vali, bereft of arms but only nails and teeth besides having agreat splendour, approached Narantaka and spoke the following words:"
6-69-83,"Stop! What can you do with these common monkeys? Throw your javelin, having thesensation equal to a thunderbolt, towards my chest."
6-69-84,"Hearing the words of Angada, Narantaka was very much enraged. The enraged Narantaka,tightly biting his lip with his teeth, hissing like a serpent, approaching Angada and firmlyholding that highly radiant javelin, then quickly released it towards Angada. That javelin brokeagainst Angada's chest, that was as hard as a diamond and fell to the earth."
6-69-85,"Then seeing his javelin shattered, like a serpent whose powerful coils were cut offby Garuda the eagle, Angada stretched out his palm and struck the head of the horse."
6-69-86,"That mountain-like Narantaka's horse, struck by a blow of the palm, had its headshattered, feet broken, eyes and pupils put out and tongue come out. It fell down on the earth."
6-69-87,"Seeing his horse fallen down dead, Narantaka was enraged. Raising his fist, thatexceedingly powerful Narantaka in battle struck Angada on his head."
6-69-88,"Then, Angada having his head shattered by the blow of the fist, heavily oozed outvery hot blood, repeatedly felt a burning sensation and swooned. On regaining consciousness, he wassurprised."
6-69-89,"Thereupon, the great-souled Angada, the son of Vali, clinching his fist and thenwith a force equal to death, rushed it against the chest of Narantaka."
6-69-90,"Having his chest deeply sunk back by that fist-blow, giving out flames and with hislimbs smeared by blood, that Narantaka fell down as a mountain is broken up by the fall of athundr-bolt."
6-69-91,"When that Narantaka of great prowess was killed by Angada in battle, the chiefs ofcelestials and the monkeys too then emitted a great roar of triumph in the sky."
6-69-92,"Then, that Angada, who showed that forcible means, which was very difficult to do,and which rejoiced Rama's intellect. So much so, Angada too was surprised. Thereupon Angada, ofterrible acts, was infused with vigour and again showed enthusiasm in battle."
6-70-1,"Seeing Narantaka dying, Devantaka, Trishira and Mahodara the son of Pulastya theforemost of demons, wept."
6-70-2,"Mounting an excellent elephant, resembling a cloud, Mahodara hurrily attacked Angadaof great energy."
6-70-3,"The strong Devantaka, tormented at his brother's calamity, then taking a terrificiron rod, ran towards Angada."
6-70-4,"Thereupon, the valiant Trishira, mounting a chariot resembling the sun and yokedwith excellent horses, marched towards Angada."
6-70-5,"That Angada, being attacked by the three chief demons, who were capable of smashingthe pride of celestials, uplifted a tree with its large boughs."
6-70-6,"The valiant Angada hurled that large tree with big branches quickly on Devantaka asIndra the lord of celestials would a blazing thunderbolt."
6-70-7,"Trishira chopped off that tree with arrows looking like serpents. Seeing the treechopped off, that Angada then sprang up."
6-70-8,"Thereupon, that foremost of monkeys streamed forth trees and rocks. The enragedTrishara chopped them off with his sharp arrows."
6-70-9,"That Mahodra broke those trees with the tip of his club. Trishira too with hisarrows attacked the valiant Angada."
6-70-10,"Marching ahead quickly towards Angada on an elephant, the enraged Mahodara struck onhis chest with javelins looking like thunderbolts."
6-70-11,"Then, the enraged Devantaka with a speed, approached Angada, struck him quickly witha club and went off to a distance."
6-70-12,"Eventhough attacked at the same time by those three foremost of demons, that Angadaof great prowess and splendour, did not get alarmed."
6-70-13,"The speedy and quite unconquerable Angada, acting with a great swiftness andattacking well, struck Devantaka's elephant with his palm."
6-70-14,"By that blow of Angada in battle, the eyes of that royal elephant fell down and thatelephant died."
6-70-15,"Pulling out a tusk of that elephant in battle, the mighty Angada ran towardsDevantaka quickly and struck him."
6-70-16,"That energetic Devantaka swayed to and fro in disorder, like a tree being tossed upby the wind and emitted plenty of blood with the colour of a lacquer."
6-70-17,"Thereafter, the strong Devantaka of great splendour, recovering his breath with agreat difficulty, then struck Angada violently, by firmly holding an iron rod."
6-70-18,"Then, Angada the son of king Vali, struck by the iron rod, fell down on his knees onthe earth, but again jumped up."
6-70-19,"While Angada, the son of Vali was jumping up, Trishira struck him with threeterrific and straight-going arrows on his forehead."
6-70-20,"Noticing Angada being surrounded by the three demon-warriors, Hanuma and Neela wentthere."
6-70-21,"Thereupon, Neela then hurled a mountain-peak on Trishira. The intelligent Trishirathe son of Ravana broke it by using his sharp arrows."
6-70-22,"That mountain-peak, broken into pieces by a multitude of arrows, with its split uprocks, fell down with sparks of fire and flames."
6-70-23,"Seeing Hanuma rushing with enthusiasm in the battle-front, that strong Devantaka rantowards him with his iron rod."
6-70-24,"Then, Hanuma the foremost of monkeys, while jumping up, struck on the head ofDevantaka rushing upon him with his fist equal to a thunder-bolt."
6-70-25,"Then, the valiant and the strong Hanuma struck him on his head. That great ape madethe demons shake with the sound."
6-70-26,"That Devantaka, the son of Ravana, with his head crushed and broken by the blow ofthe fist, with his teeth and eyes coming out and with his tongue hanging down, swiftly fell downdead on the earth."
6-70-27,"When that Devantaka the mighty chief of demon-warriors and the enemy of celestialswas killed in battle, the enraged Trishira showered a terrible rain of sharp-pointed arrows onNeela's chest."
6-70-28,"Again mounting an elephant resembling a mountain, as the sun mounting MandaraMountain, that enraged Mahodara on his part, caused rain of arrows to fall quickly on Neela, likerumbling cloud with a circle of lightning, showers rain on a mountain."
6-70-29,"Thereupon, by the rain of a multitude of arrows, the body of Neela the commander ofthe army of monkeys became blown up. Thus the mighty Mahodara then made his loosened limbsparalyzed."
6-70-30,"After regaining consciousness, Neela uplifted a mountain consisting of a number oftrees and then jumping up with a great speed, struck with it on the head of Mahodara."
6-70-31,"That Mahodara, then shattered by the fall of that mountain and crushed by that largeelephant too, lost his life and fell down on the earth like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt."
6-70-32,"Seeing Mahodara his young paternal uncle killed. Trishira was enraged seized hold ofhis bow and struck Hanuma with sharp arrows."
6-70-33,"While that enraged Hanuma hurled a mountain-peak, the strong Trishira broke it intoseveral pieces with his sharp arrows."
6-70-34,"Seeing that mountain-peak becoming useless, Hanuma then hurled a volley of treestowards Trishira in that battle-field."
6-70-35,"The valiant Trishira chopped off that volley of trees descending on him, with hissharp arrows in the sky itself and roared aloud."
6-70-36,"Then, the enraged Hanuma on his part, bouncing up, tore asunder with his nails,Trishira's horse, as a lion tears asunder a large elephant."
6-70-37,"Thereupon, Trishira the son of Ravana seizing hold of a spear, as Yama the lord ofdeath takes in his service Kalaratri, a night of all-destroying time, hurled it on Hanuma."
6-70-38,"Capturing that spear coming like a meteor in the sky, Hanuma the foremost of monkeysbroke it, even without its descending on him and roared too."
6-70-39,"Seeing that spear of a terrific form broken up by Hanuma, the monkey-troops werevery much delighted and roared aloud like rumbling clouds."
6-70-40,"Thereupon, lifting up a sword, Trishira the foremost of demons them dug it intoHanuma's breast."
6-70-41,"Hurt by the thrust of the sword, the valiant Hanuma the son of wind-god, struckTrishira on his breast, with his palm."
6-70-42,"Struck by Hanuma's palm, that Trishira of great splendour fell down unconscious onthe earth with the weapons slipping from his hand."
6-70-43,"Hanuma, that large ape, equal to a mountain in size, snatching away that fallingsword of Trishira, roared loudly frightening all the demons there."
6-70-44,"Unable to bear that roar, the demon jumped up and struck Hanuma with his fist."
6-70-45,"Enraged as he was by the blow of Trishiras's fist, Hanuma seized hold of Trishirathe foremost of demons by his head covered by his diadem."
6-70-46,"That enraged Hanuma the son of wind-god chopped off with that sharp sword, his threeheads furnished with diadems and ear-rings, like Indra the lord of celestials chopped off the headsof Vishvarupa the son of Tvashta."
6-70-47,"Those mountain-like heads of Trishira the enemy of Indra, having longish organs ofsenses and having fire-like blazing eyes, fell down on earth, as planets and stars drop from thetrack of the sun."
6-70-48,"When that Trishira, the enemy of celestials, having a prowess equal to that of Indrawas killed, the monkeys made a loud noise. The earth trembled. Then, the demons ran awayeverywhere. Seeing Trishira, Mahodara and the invincible Devantaka killed, Matta (Mahaparshva) wasenraged with indignation."
6-70-49,"Then, Mahaparshva was holding a large mace, which was resplendent, completely madeof iron, wound round with golden wires, filled with a froth of flesh and blood, satiated with theblood enemies, the upper most part of which was blazing with splendour, decked with red colouredgarlands and which frightened the elephants supporting the quarters like Airavata, Mahapadma andSarvabhauma."
6-70-50,"Taking that mace, the enraged Matta, the foremost of demons, went quickly to themonkeys like the blazing fire at the end of the world."
6-70-51,"Then, a strong monkey called Rishabha came jumping and stood in front of thatMattanika (Mahaparshva), the younger brother of Ravana."
6-70-52,"Enraged in seeing that Rishabha, looking like a mountain, standing before him,Mahaparshva struck him upon his breast with a mace equaling a thunderbolt."
6-70-53,"When he struck with his mace, the breast of that Rishabha the foremost of demons wasbroken. He then trembled and exuded blood profusely."
6-70-54,"That Rishabha, the supreme monkey regained his consciousness after a long while andenraged as he was with his lips quivering, looked towards Mahaparshva."
6-70-55,"That Rishabha, the supreme monkey regained his consciousness after a long while andenraged as he was with his lips quivering, looked towards Mahaparshva."
6-70-56,"With his body drenched in blood, that Mahaparshva suddenly fell unconscious on theground, like a tree with its root cut off. Then, taking quickly Mahaparshva's mace, which waslooking like Yama's rod, he roared loudly."
6-70-57,"Mahaparshva remained as though he was dead for a while. Springing suddenly afterregaining his consciousness, that demon, whose colour resembled his consciousness, that demon,whose colour resembled an evening cloud, struck that Rishabha, the son of Varuna the lord ofwaters."
6-70-58,"That Rishabha fell unconscious for a while on the ground. Rising after regainingconsciousness and tightly holding just the same mace, which was looking like a large mountain-peak,banged it on Mahapatra in the battle-field."
6-70-59,"That terrific mace, reaching the body of Mahaparshva, the fierce demon, the enemy ofcelestials, sacrificial rites and Brahmanas, broke his chest. Mahaparshva started exuding copiousblood, as a supreme mountain exudes water full of minerals."
6-70-60,"The great souled Rishabha quickly ran towards the mace of that mighty Mahaparshva.Seizing that dreadful mace and striking it repeatedly on the floor, he struck it on Mahaparshva inthe battle-front."
6-70-61,"Struck by his own mace, that Mahaparshva with his teeth and eyes fallen out, felldown like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt."
6-70-62,"When that demon depleted his strength, burst open his eyes, with his long life goneaway and fallen down on the ground, the army of demons ran away."
6-70-63,"When that Mahaparshva was killed, that army of demons, which was as extensive as anocean, abandoning their weapons in the battle-field, fled for mere lives, like a sea which hasburst its shores."
6-71-1,"Seeing his own army making a tumultuous sound tottering with excessive fear, seeinghis brothers having a prowess equal to that of Indra the lord of celestials having been killed, andseeing his paternal uncles as also Yuddhonmatta and Matta (Mahodara and Mahaparshva) his brothersand the foremost of demons having been fallen down, Atikaya of great splendour, having boonsbestowed by Brahma the lord of creation, having appearance of a mountain and who removed the prideof celestials and ogres, was enraged."
6-71-2,"That Atikaya, the enemy of Indra the lord of celestials, mounting a chariot shininglike a cluster of thousand suns, ran towards the monkeys."
6-71-3,"Wearing a crown and well-cleansed ear-rings as also drawing his bow, he roared witha big noise, making his name loudly heard."
6-71-4,"By that lion-like roar, making his name loudly heard and by that terrific sound ofthe bow-string, it created terror to the monkeys."
6-71-5,"Seeing the bulkiness of his body, all the monkeys, thinking that Kumbhakarna woke upagain, took refuge with each other, afflicted as they were, with fear."
6-71-6,"Seeing his form appearing like Vishnu who strided over the three worlds in threesteps, the those renowned monkey-warriors with fear, ran away hither and thither."
6-71-7,"When Atikaya was to be attacked, the monkeys were bewildered in mind and sought inthe battle, a refuge with Rama, who affords protection."
6-71-8,"Then, Rama saw from a distance, Atikaya, who resembled a mountain in size, stationedin a chariot, armed with a bow and rumbling like a cloud appearing at the time of universaldissolution."
6-71-9,"Seeing that Atikaya, having a colossal body, Rama for his part was quite surprisedand after consoling the monkeys, spoke to Vibhishana (as follows):"
6-71-10,"Who is he, resembling a mountain in size, armed with a bow, brown-eyed and seatedin a spacious chariot yoked with a thousand horses?"
6-71-11,"He is shining like Lord Shiva surrounded by genii, with resplendent and sharpspikes, with very sharply barbed javelins and lances."
6-71-12,"He is shining like a lightening cloud and moving round with staffs which supportthe banners of the war-chariot, appearing like tongues of the Time-Sprit."
6-71-13,"Bows adhered with golden backs in his excellent chariot are shining on all sideslike a rainbow in the sky."
6-71-14,"That warrior of demons, the eminent of charioteers, making the battle-front toshine, is coming in a chariot with the splendour of the sun, with arrows having gleams ofsun-beams, shining in ten directions and embellishing brilliance by an emblem of Rahu installed onthe point of his standard."
6-71-15,"His triply curved, golden backed and decorated bow, having a rumbling sound of thecloud, is shining like a rain-bow."
6-71-16,"His large chariot, with its flag and emblem, with its axle-tree at the bottom, andhaving the sound of a cloud's lightning, consists of four charioteers."
6-71-17,"Twenty quivers, ten terrific bows and eight bow-strings, golden and reddish brown incolour, are abiding in his chariot."""
6-71-18,"On that chariot are hanging two swords, clearly measuring ten cubits in length andprovided with measuring four cubits, casting their splendour on his two sides."
6-71-19,"This brave warrior, with a red garland adorning his neck, resembling a largemountain black in colour and having a month as large as Death, looks like the sun veiled by acloud."
6-71-20,"With his arms adorned with gold armlets, he shines like the Himalaya, the highestmountain with its two lofty peaks."
6-71-21,"His awfully dreadful face, with two ear-rings, is shining like a full moonappearing between the two stars constituting the constellation, Punnarvasu."
6-71-22,"O the long armed! Tell me who this foremost of demons is! On seeing him all themonkeys, afflicted with fear, are running away in different directions."
6-71-23,"Thus asked by Rama, the prince having an unlimited splendour, that Vibhishana ofgreat brilliance, replied to Rama as follows:"
6-71-24,"The ten-necked king Ravana, having great brilliance, the brother of Kubera the lordof wealth, doing terrific deeds and possessing a great power, is the lord of demons."
6-71-25,"To him, there is a valiant son, equal to Ravana in combat, who serves elders,holding that which is heard from them and skilled in the use of weaponry."
6-71-26,"He is respected for his counsel, for his rides on the backs of horses andelephants, for his drawing out of the sword and the bow, for his strategy winning over to his sideby sowing dissention negotiation and bribery and for his steering capacity of an army."
6-71-27,"He is Atikaya, the son of Dhanyamali. Lanka is feeling fearless, by resting on hisarm."
6-71-28,"He, who purified his soul by meditating on the universal soul, worshipped Brahmathe lord of creation, obtained missiles too and conquered the enemies."
6-71-29,"Brahma, the lord of creation, granted a boon, exempting him from death at the handsof celestials and demons as also this wonderful armour and the chariot shining like the sun."
6-71-30,"He conquered the celestials and the ogres several times, destroyed Yakshas thesupernatural beings and defended the demons."
6-71-31,"He is Atikaya, who paralyzed the thunderbolt of the intelligent Indra with hisarrows. He struck down the noose of Varuna, the seizer of transgressors. This wise Ravana's son,who is strong and the foremost of demons took off the pride of celestials and ogres."
6-71-32,"O Rama, the foremost of men! Therefore let the effort to destroy him be madequickly. Otherwise shortly, he will bring in destruction for our army of monkeys, with hisarrows."
6-71-33,"Entering the army of monkeys, the strong Atikaya then stretched his bow and roaredagain and again."
6-71-34,"Seeing him with a terrific body, seated in the chariot, as the excellent one amongthe charioteers, powerful chiefs of monkeys rushed towards him."
6-71-35,"Taking trees and mountain peaks, Kumuda, Dvivida, Mainda, Nila and Sharabha marchedforwards quickly to attack him at once."
6-71-36,"Atikaya of great splendour, the foremost among those skilled in weaponry, choppedoff their trees and crags with his arrows decked with gold."
6-71-37,"That strong and skilled Atikaya with a terrific body, struck all those monkeys,facing in front of him in battle with arrows fully made of iron."
6-71-38,"Those overthrown monkeys, injured with their blown out bodies, by the shower ofAtikaya's arrows in that great battle, were unable to retaliate on him."
6-71-39,"That demon, who was arrogant of his youth, frightened that army of monkey-warriors,as an enraged lion frightens a herd of deers."
6-71-40,"That chief of demons did not strike whomsoever of the monkey-warriors who wereunable to fight. That Atikaya, with his bow and quiver of arrows, going up quickly towards Rama,spoke haughty words (to him) as follows:"
6-71-41,"I am seated in the chariot with arrows and a bow in my hand. I would not givebattle with any common warrior. He who has ability and energy can give his fight to me now and herequickly."
6-71-42,"Hearing his words, Lakshmana the annihilator of enemies was enraged. Then, unable tobear his words and smiling, he rose up quickly and took up his bow."
6-71-43,"The enraged Lakshmana, coming forward quickly and taking off an arrow from hisquiver pulled out his great bow in front of Atikaya."
6-71-44,"That twang of the bow of Lakshmana, filling the entire quarters, earth, sky and theocean, was angry, frightening the demons."
6-71-45,"Hearing the terrific twang of Lakshmana's bow, the strong Atikaya of greatsplendour, was surprised."
6-71-46,"Seeing Lakshmana standing in front of him for the battle, Atikaya then was enragedand taking a sharp arrow, spoke the following words:"
6-71-47,"O Lakshmana! You are still a boy. You are ignorant of a fight. Why do you wish tofight with me, who is like Yama the Lord of Death? Go away."
6-71-48,"Even the Himalayan Mountains or the sky or the earth would be unable to endure thespeed of arrows released by my arms."
6-71-49,"You wish to arouse a fire of dissolution, when it is sleeping happily. Placing yourbow here, go back. Do not lose your life, by fighting against me."
6-71-50,"If you do not go back, with an obstinance, then you rather stay back. Abandoningyour lives, you will reach the abode of Yama."
6-71-51,"See my sharp arrows decked with pure gold, which can remove the pride of my enemiesand which are like the weapons of Ishvara the lord of destruction."
6-71-52,"This arrow looking like a serpent will drink your blood as a lion drinks the bloodof an elephant. Thus speaking, Atikaya was enraged and fixed an arrow on his bow."
6-71-53,"Hearing the words of Atikaya, filled with anger and arrogance in that battle-field,Lakshmana was enraged. Thereafter, that Lakshmana, having a great strength wisdom and great glory,also spoke as follows:"
6-71-54,"O the evil-minded! Just by uttering mere words, you cannot by a very importantperson. People cannot become good persons, just by boasting of themselves. You rather show yourstrength in me, who is standing with an arrow in hand and wielding a bow."
6-71-55,"Reveal yourself by your deeds. You do not deserve to boast of yourself. A personwith valour alone is declared as a warrior."
6-71-56,"You are seated in a chariot, with all the weaponry and wielding a bow. Show yourprowess either by your arrows or even by your weapons."
6-71-57,"Thereupon, with sharp arrows, I shall strike down your head like a fruit of afan-palm, ripened by its time, is fallen down from its stalk by the gust of a wind."
6-71-58,"Today, these arrows of mine decked with pure gold, will drink blood oozing forthfrom the holes formed in your body by the sharp points of my arrows."
6-71-59,"Thinking me to be a boy, you need not disregard me. Either as the boy or as theaged, you indeed know me in battle-front as the god of Death. Vishnu, as a boy occupied the threeworlds just with his three strides, Didn't he?"
6-71-60,"Hearing the reasonable and highly meaningful words of Lakshmana, Atikaya was verymuch enraged and took out an excellent arrow."
6-71-61,"Then, Vidyadharas the supernatural beings, Bhutas the spirits, Devas the celestials,Daityas the demons, Maharshies the great sages and Guhyakas a class of demi-gods, all the greatsouled ones saw that battle."
6-71-62,"Thereafter, the enraged Atikaya, stringing an arrow to his bow, dispatched ittowards Lakshmana, as though he were shrinking up the space in between."
6-71-63,"Lakshmana, the annihilator of enemy-warriors, chopped off that serpent-like sharparrow, which was falling down on him, with his crescent-pointed arrow."
6-71-64,"Seeing that arrow which was chopped off as a snake's hood severed into pieces,Atikaya was very much enraged and fitted five arrows to his bow."
6-71-65,"That demon hurled those arrows towards Lakshmana. Even before they reached him,Lakshmana chopped them off with his sharp arrows."
6-71-66,"Cutting off those arrows with his sharp arrows that Lakshmana, the destroyer ofenemy-warriors, took up a sharp arrow, as though it was blazing with a glow."
6-71-67,"Taking that arrow, Lakshmana harnessed it on his excellent bow, stretched it withforce and released it."
6-71-68,"That valiant Lakshmana, by a flat-jointed arrow released fully, struck it on theforehead of that excellent demon."
6-71-69,"That arrow, sunken into the forehead of that terrible demon, smeared with blood,appeared like a serpent-king on a mountain."
6-71-70,"The demon, tormented by Lakshmana's arrow, then trembled violently as when theterrific town-gate of Tripura City, (built of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth byMaya for the demons) was struck by Shiva's arrow."
6-71-71,"That demon of great strength, recovering his breath, reasoningly reflected asfollows: ""Well! By flying down an arrow, you have become a commendable enemy for me."""
6-71-72,"Thus speaking with his mouth wide open, Atikaya bent down with his large shoulder,ascended the top of his chariot and roamed about hither and thither by his chariot."
6-71-73,"Atikaya, the foremost of demons, seized hold of one, three, five and seven arrowsand fixed them to his bow, stretched it and released the arrows."
6-71-74,"Those arrows, released from the bow of Atikaya, the leader of demons, appearing asDeath, with golden shafts and shining like the sun, set the sky ablaze."
6-71-75,"Thereupon, Lakshmana coolly chopped off those gluts of arrows released by thatforemost of demons, by the multitude of his sharp arrows."
6-71-76,"That Atikaya, of great splendour, fixing that arrow to his bow and by instantlyreleasing it, struck the approaching Lakshmana in the middle of his chest."
6-71-77,"That Atikaya, of great splendour, fixing that arrow to his bow and by instantlyreleasing it, struck the approaching Lakshmana in the middle of his chest."
6-71-78,"Struck in battle by Atikaya in his chest, Lakshmana oozed out blood severely, likethe fluid exuding from a rutting elephant."
6-71-79,"That powerful Lakshmana, then quickly made himself freed from that arrow-head, tookup a sharp arrow and fixed it with a missile."
6-71-80,"When Lakshmana employed the missile of fire on his arrow, that arrow of the greatsouled Lakshmana and as also the bow, caused a flame to blaze."
6-71-81,"Atikaya of great splendour took up a solar missile and employed it on that arrow,having a golden shaft as also looking like a serpent."
6-71-82,"Meanwhile, Lakshmana hurled at Atikaya, that blazing and awful arrow employed withthat mystic missile as Yama the lord of Death would hurl his rod of destruction."
6-71-83,"Seeing that arrow charged with a mystic missile of fire, Atikaya the demon thenreleased the awful arrow charged with the solar missile."
6-71-84,"Those two arrows, having their points blazed in splendour, struck at each other inthe sky, like two enraged serpents."
6-71-85,"Those two excellent arrows, eventhough they were both blazing, did not radiate anylonger on the earth's surface, in that they were without a flame and had been reduced to ashes."
6-71-86,"Thereupon, the enraged Atikaya released an arrow made of cane (a missile) presidedover by Tvasha (the architect of gods). Then, the valiant LakShmana chopped off that missile, byhis missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials."
6-71-87,"Seeing his arrow made of cane struck down, that young Atikaya was quite enraged andfixed his arrow with a missile presided over by Yama the lord of retribution."
6-71-88,"Thereupon, Atikaya hurled that missile on Lakshmana. That Lakshmana struck it downby a missile presided over by the wind-god."
6-71-89,"Then, the furious Lakshmana showered forth hails of arrows on Atikaya, as a rainycloud showers hails of down-pour."
6-71-90,"Reaching Atikaya, those arrows with the points of their shafts shattered on hisarmour, adorned with diamonds and instantly fell on the earth's surface."
6-71-91,"Seeing those arrows becoming unsuccessful, the highly famous Lakshmana theannihilator of enemy-warriors, showered forth arrows in thousands."
6-71-92,"Atikaya, that mighty demon, though deluged with a flood of arrows, was not agitatedin battle because of the inviolability of his armour."
6-71-93,"Atikaya released an arrow having a serpent-like form on Lakshmana. Struck by thatarrow on his vital parts, that Lakshmana, the tormentator of his enemies, felt unconscious just fora moment."
6-71-94,"Having regained his consciousness, the mighty Lakshmana, the annihilator of enemies,with his flood of arrows threw down the flag-staff and killed the horses and the charioteer incombat, with his four excellent arrows."
6-71-95,"Free from flurry, that Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, released those arrows, exactlyaiming at that demon, for the purpose of killing him."
6-71-96,"Lakshmana, the best among men, was not able to afflict any injury to Atikaya inbattle. Then, the wind-god came to him and spoke to him as follows:"
6-71-97,"He, endowed with a boon by Brahma the lord of creation, is cloaked by inviolablearmour. Split him with a missile of Brahma. He cannot be killed by any other means. The mightyAtikaya, with that armour, cannot be destroyed by other missiles."
6-71-98,"Then, hearing the words of the wind-god, Lakshmana having a prowess equal to that ofIndra the lord of celestials, adjusting his arrow with a missile presided over by Vrahma, quicklydirected the arrow with a terrific force."
6-71-99,"While fixing that excellent missile on that superior sharp-pointed arrow byLakshmana, all the quarters, the sun, the moon, the great planets and the sky were frightened.Earth also made an uproar."
6-71-100,"Having charged the missile of Brahma on that arrow with the feathers and all, equalto a messenger of Yama the lord of Death over his bow, Lakshmana released that arrow looking like athunderbolt on Atikaya, the son of Ravana."
6-71-101,"Atikaya saw that arrow, released with augmented force by Lakshmana, moving so fastlyas the wind, having beautiful wings with variegated feathers and looking like a thunderousthunderbolt, approaching him in battle."
6-71-102,"Seeing that arrow, Atikaya quickly struck with several sharp arrows. ThatLakshmana's arrow, with a speed equal to Garuda the eagle, thus reached Atikaya's proximity."
6-71-103,"Seeing that blazing arrow, looking like Yama the lord of Death and black in colour,approaching him, Atikaya then struck it with spike, spear, mace, axe and arrows."
6-71-104,"Then, that arrow, blazing like fire, made in vain those weapons of wonderful formand taking Atikaya's head, carried it away."
6-71-105,"That head with its diadem, chopped off by Lakshmana, quickly fell down on theground, like a peak of the Himalayan Mountain."
6-71-106,"Seeing Atikaya falling on the ground, with his clothes and ornaments scattered away,all the surviving demons became perturbed."
6-71-107,"Many of those depressed demons, dejected as they were, showing fatigue born offighting, in their faces, suddenly began to shout loudly, with their voices in discordantnotes."
6-71-108,"As their leader was dead, the demons were then frightened and becoming indifferentto fight, went running away all around, with their faces turned towards that City of Lanka."
6-71-109,"When the dangerous demon with the terrific strength was killed, the multitude ofmonkeys then were endowed with a great delight, with their faces looking like full blown lotusesand worshipped Lakshmana who got his desire fulfilled."
6-71-110,"Throwing down in battle, that Atikaya who was exceedingly strong and looking like acloud, Lakshmana was greatly delighted and while he was being worshipped by the multitude ofmonkeys, thereupon quickly hastened towards the proximity of Rama."
6-72-1,"Hearing Atikaya having been killed in the hands of the great-souled Lakshmana,Ravana was worried and spoke as follows:"
6-72-2,"Dhumraksha, who was greatly impatient Akampana who was excellent among all wieldersof weapons, Prahasta and Kumbhakarna were killed by Rama, who was unwearied in battle. The mightyand valiant demons longing for battle, who conquer the adversaries, who was never defeated inbattle by the enemies they along with their enemies were killed. Many other mighty warriors."
6-72-3,"That day, Indrajit, my son, whose strength and prowess are renowned, bound bothRama and Lakshmana, the brothers with terrific arrows, on which boons had been conferred."
6-72-4,"That terrific bind of arrow cannot be released by any celestial or a mighty demonor by Yakshas the supernatural beings or Gandharvas the celestial musicians or Pannagas theserpent-demons. Rama and Lakshmana, the two brothers were released from that tie of arrows eitherby their power or by their sorcery or by their marvel I do not know that."
6-72-5,"All of those valiant demon-warriors set out for battle, at my command, were killedby those exceptionally mighty monkeys."
6-72-6,"I do not find any demon, who can destroy the valiant Rama along with Lakshmana,Sugreeva and Vibhishana accompanied by their army in battle now."
6-72-7,"By Rama's valour, the demons were destroyed. Alas! How great is Rama's strength!How great is the power of his arrow!"
6-72-8,"Some regiments of the army have to protect this City and even Ashoka garden whereSeetha is being guarded, vigilantly on all sides."
6-72-9,"We should know the locations of army-regiments and also the places where personsare exiting and entering at all times, again and again."
6-72-10,"O demons! Stay on all sides with your respective armies. The various positioning ofthose monkeys are to be watched."
6-72-11,"Indifference should not be shown to monkeys in any way at any time, either atevening or at midnight or at dawn. You have watch whether the army of adversaries is ferventlyactive or advancing or staying where it was."
6-72-12,"Hearing those words of Ravana, all the mighty demons then precisely carried it outforthwith in its totality."
6-72-13,"Having thus instructed all of them, Ravana the king of demons, suffering fromprickly sorrow and depression, penetrated deeply into his palace."
6-72-14,"Blazed as he was with a fire of anger, Ravana the mighty lord of demons, thenremained broading about the loss of his son (Atikaya) and also sighing again and again."
6-73-1,"Then, those surviving troops of demons hastily told Ravana that Devantaka, Trishira,Atikaya and other foremost of demons had been killed."
6-73-2,"Thereupon, suddenly hearing of those who had been killed, Ravana the prosperous kingof demons, having his eyes filled with profuse tears; boarding over the terrific destroyal of hisson as also the death of his brothers, contemplated for long."
6-73-3,"Then, seeing Ravana the king, miserably submerged in a sea of sorrow, Indrajit,Ravana's son, the best among charioteers, spoke to him as follows:"
6-73-4,"O father, the king of demons! You ought not to get embarrassed, while Indrajit isalive. Anyone who is struck by Indrajit's arrows cannot indeed protect his life."
6-73-5,"Today, you will see Rama along with Lakshmana, with their bodies undistinguished,scattered and dead, lying down on the floor, with their limbs diffused all over."
6-73-6,"Listen to Indrajit's promise, which is very firm, backed by valour and divineblessing. Now itself, I will overwhelm Rama together with Lakshmana unfailing flood of arrows."
6-73-7,"Now itself, Indra, Yama, Vishnu, Rudra, Sadhyas (a class of celestial beings), thefire-god, the sun and the moon can see my unlimited prowess, like the terrific prowess of Vishnu(in his dwarf incarnation as Vamana) in the enclosure where a sacrifice was being performed byBali, the demon-king."
6-73-8,"Thus speaking, that Indrajit, with an undepressed mind, after seeking permissionfrom the king, mounted his chariot with a speed equal to that of wind and yoked with excellentdonkeys."
6-73-9,"That greatly resplendent Indrajit, the annihilator of enemies, having ascended achariot looking like the chariot of the sun, quickly went to the battle-front."
6-73-10,"Many mighty demons with terrific prowess, with joy, holding excellent bows in theirhands, carrying lances, sharp-edged spears, swords, axes and maces as also armed with Bhushundis(probably a kind of fire arms), mallets, cudgels, Shataghnis (cylindrical piece of wood studdedwith iron spikes) and iron rods, followed that great souled Indrajit. Some rode on the back ofelephants, some ascended excellent horses, tigers, scorpions, cats, donkeys and camels,looking."
6-73-11,"That valiant Indrajit swiftly went to the battle-field with full blasts of couchesand kettle-drums."
6-73-12,"Indrajit, the tormentator of enemies, with a parasol white as a couch and the moon,shone like the sky with the full moon."
6-73-13,"The valiant Indrajit, the foremost among all the wielders of bow and decked withgold ornaments, was being fanned then with supremely charming whisks with handles of gold."
6-73-14,"Seeing that son setting out with a large army, that glorious Ravana, the king ofdemons, spoke as follows:"
6-73-15,"O my dear son! There is no charioteer who can stand you as your rival. Indra thelord of celestials was conquered by you. You can kill Rama, a mere human being, who is assailable.How much more can I tell? After hearing these words of Ravana Indrajit accepted his greatblessings."
6-73-16,"With that Indrajit, having a splendour equal to that of the sun and having nowarrior who can stand him as his rival, the City of Lanka shone, like the sky shining with thesun."
6-73-17,"Reaching the battle-field, Indrajit of great splendour, the annihilator of enemies,stationed his demons around his chariot."
6-73-18,"Then, that foremost of demons, having a radiance equal to that of fire, withexcellent sacrificial incantations, performed a sacrifice, as per rules, making an oblation to thefire."
6-73-19,"That valiant leader of demons offered oblations to fire there, with garlands andpounded sandalwood, including clarified butter and parched grain."
6-73-20,"That sacrificial rite was performed with weapons serving as reeds, chips ofVibhishaka tree serving as fuel, then using red pieces of cloth and the sacrificial ladle made ofiron."
6-73-21,"Duly spreading fire with reeds (in the form of other weapons) accompanied by lancesthere, Indrajit elapsed the neck of a live goat of dark hue (for offering it to the fire as anoblation)."
6-73-22,"From the great fire of flames, set ablaze by that offering having been thrown intoit acting at once without smoke, appeared such signs as had beckoned victory (of the past)."
6-73-23,"The fire, resembling the molten gold, rising up on its own and having flamesrevolving from left to right, accepted that oblation."
6-73-24,"Indrajit, who was skilled in the use of mystic missiles, invoked the missilepresided over by Brahma and charged it on his bow, chariot and all."
6-73-25,"While that missile was being invoked and the sacrificial fire propitiated, thefirmament including the sun, the moon, other planets and lunar mansions trembled with fear."
6-73-26,"Having propitiated offering in fire, Indrajit, having a splendour shining like thefire, having a might similar to that of Indra, and possessing an unimaginable prowess, becamehimself invisible in the sky, with the bow, arrows, sword, chariot, horses, charioteer and all."
6-73-27,"Then, the army of demons, extensive with horses and chariots, embellished by bannersand flags, set out with a desire to fight, roaring."
6-73-28,"They killed the monkeys in the battle-field with many wonderful and ornamentalarrows, possessing great velocity as also lances and goads."
6-73-29,"Seeing those demons, the most enraged Indrajit on his part spoke to them as follows:""All of you fight enthusiastically with an intent to kill the monkeys."""
6-73-30,"Roaring with a desire for victory, all those demons thereafter terribly rainedshowers of arrows on monkeys."
6-73-31,"That Indrajit, on his part, along with his demons in the battle-field, destroyed themonkeys with Nalika (broad-headed) arrows, steel arrows, maces and clubs."
6-73-32,"Those monkeys, wielding trees as their weapons, being struck in the battle-field,quickly rained mountains and trees on Indrajit."
6-73-33,"Indrajit the son of Ravana, on his part, possessing great splendour and greatstrength, was enraged and wounded the bodies of the monkeys."
6-73-34,"Bringing enormous delight to the demons that enraged Indrajit severed off themonkeys by nines, fives and sevens with a single arrow."
6-73-35,"That most invincible chief of demons, with arrows decked with gold, havingbrilliance equal to the sun, destroyed the monkeys in battle."
6-73-36,"Those monkeys, tormented by the arrows in battle, with their limbs severed, felldown with their aspirations shaken, like the great demons fallen down by the celestials."
6-73-37,"Those excellent monkeys with anger attacked Indrajit, who was tormenting them likethe sun with his terrific ray-like the sun with his terrific ray-like arrows."
6-73-38,"Then, all the monkeys, with their bodies severed, having lost their consciousnessand perturbed as they were, having their limbs dampened with blood, took to their heels."
6-73-39,"Those monkeys, wielding mountains as their weapons, roaring in the battle field,without turning back, abandoned their lives, showing their courage for the sake of Rama."
6-73-40,"Continuing to stay in the battle-field, those monkeys rained trees, mountain-peaksand rocks on Indrajit."
6-73-41,"Indrajit of great splendour and the conqueror of battles, kept off that great rainof deadly hail of trees and rocks."
6-73-42,"Thereupon, the capable Indrajit with his arrows, identical of fire and looking likeserpents in battle, split the armies of monkeys."
6-73-43,"Indrajit struck Gandhamadana with eighteen sharp arrows and also struck Neela, whowas standing at a far-away place, with nine arrows."
6-73-44,"Indrajit having a great prowess, struck Mainda with seven arrows, which can tearasunder vital parts and also struck Gaja with five arrows in battle."
6-73-45,"Indrajit then struck Jambavan with ten arrows and Nila with thirty arrows. He alsostruck Sugreeva, Rishabha, Angada and Dvivida with sharp and terrific arrows endowed with boons andmade them breathless."
6-73-46,"That enraged Indrajit, then looking like an excited fire that is to destroy theworld, tormented other chiefs of monkeys too with many arrows."
6-73-47,"He harassed the armies of monkeys' fast-moving arrows looking like the sun in theirsplendour."
6-73-48,"That enthusiastic Indrajit, with a great pleasure, saw that exclusive army ofmonkeys, drenched in blood and tormented by a multitude of arrows."
6-73-49,"Indrajit, the son of Ravana, possessing a great splendour power and strength, againgenerating a terrific rain of arrows and weapons, destroyed the army of monkeys from all sides."
6-73-50,"Leaving off his army from that great battle-field and becoming invisible, Indrajitadvanced towards the monkeys and quickly rained terrific hail of arrows on those armies of monkeys,as black cloud downpours the rain."
6-73-51,"In that battle, those mountain-like monkeys as victims of conjuring tricks withtheir bodies torn into pieces by Indrajit's arrows and roaring as they were with discordant notes,fell down on earth, like mountains struck by Indra's thunder bolt."
6-73-52,"Those monkeys in battle saw only arrows with pointed tips falling on the armies ofmonkeys. They could not see there, that Indrajit the demon, the enemy of Indra, remaining concealedby his conjuring trick."
6-73-53,"Then, the mighty Indrajit, the leader of demons, covered all the quarters withhundreds of sharply pointed arrows, having splendour of the sun and tore asunder themonkey-chiefs."
6-73-54,"Indrajit excessively rained on the army of monkeys' pikes, swords and axes, shininglike augmented and flaming fire and shooting forth incandescent flames with sparks."
6-73-55,"Struck by the Indrajit's arrows, shining brightly as fire, the monkey-commandersthen looked like Kimshuka trees bearing crimson flowers."
6-73-56,"Those excellent monkeys, torn asunder by that chief of demons, approaching at eachother and roaring in a discordant tone, fell down on the ground."
6-73-57,"Banged in the eyes by arrows, some monkeys looking up towards the sky, joined eachother and fell down on the floor."
6-73-58,"With lances, spikes and sharp arrows, charged with sacred texts, Indrajit theexcellent demon struck all those foremost of monkeys, namely Hanuman, Sugreeva, Angada,Gandhamadana, Jambavan, Sushena, Vegadarshina, Mainda, Dvivida, Nila, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Kesari,Hariloma, Vidyuddamshtra, Suryanana, Jyothimukha, a monkey called Dadhimukha, Pavakaksha, Nala asalso a monkey named Kumuda."
6-73-59,"Tearing asunder the principal monkey-warriors by maces and arrows, which were ofgolden colour, that Indrajit rained a multitude of showers of arrows equal to sun's rays on Ramaand Lakshmana."
6-73-60,"Ignoring that showering rain of arrows, as though they are mere showers of rain,that Rama of the most wonderful luster, looking around thoroughly, then spoke to Lakshmana asfollows:"
6-73-61,"O Lakshmana! This Indrajit, by a great missile, is throwing down our army ofmonkeys and tormenting us incessantly with his sharp arrows."
6-73-62,"How can the mighty and composed Indrajit on whom a boon has been bestowed by Brahmaand who has concealed his terrible form who stands with his weapons uplifted eventhough his body isvisible be killed in the battle today?"
6-73-63,"I think the self-born Brahma who is the source of the universe is inconceivable andthis missile is presided over by him. O wise one! Remaining undistracted in mind, you bear alongwith me today the hail of arrows here."
6-73-64,"Let this chief of demons, who is surpassing all, be covered with a multitude ofshowers of arrows. This entire army of Sugreeva, whose leading warriors have fallen, looks no morecharming."
6-73-65,"Finding both of us fallen unconscious without displaying any joy or anger as alsohaving desisted from fighting, Indrajit will certainly return to Lanka, after having obtainedlaurels of battle in its beginning itself."
6-73-66,"Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana there became struck by a multitude of arrows ofIndrajit. That leader of demons also there, causing affliction to both of them, roared with athrill of rapture in battle."
6-73-67,"Thus causing the army of monkeys along with Rama and Lakshmana to become despondentin battle, that Indrajit, getting eulogized by the demons, quickly reached the city of Lanka whichwas being protected by Ravana's arms. Then, Indrajit cheerfully informed all that had happened, tohis father."
6-74-1,"Then, in the battle-front, Rama and Lakshmana were knocked down senseless. The armyof monkey-leaders fainted. Sugreeva, Nila, Angada and Jambavan could not understand what to do."
6-74-2,"Seeing the entire army looking worried, Vibhishana, the best among the intelligentones, spoke the following matchless words, consoling the warriors of Sugreeva, the lord ofmonkeys:"
6-74-3,"Honouring the spell sacred of Brahma the creator, the two sons of the venerableDasaratha have actually lost their free will and became dejected and have allowed themselves to beknocked down by the missiles of Indrajit. Hence do not be afraid. There is no occasion fordespondency now."
6-74-4,"This excellent missile, presided over by Brahma the creator, with never-failingstrength, was given to Indrajit by Brahma. Honouring it, Rama and Lakshmana the princes fell downin battle. This not a time for despondency here."
6-74-5,"Then, the intelligent Hanuma, the son of wind-god, paying honour to the missilepresided over by Brahma and hearing the words of Vibhishana, spoke the following words:"
6-74-6,"Let us restore to confidence whosoever is in this army of energetic monkeys, afterhaving been struck by the missile."
6-74-7,"Both those valiant ones, Hanuma and Vibhishana, together at that time of the night,roamed about in the battle-front, with torches in their hands."
6-74-8,"Hanuma and Vibhishana saw the battle-field, covered on all sides, withmountain-sized monkeys fallen with heir tails, arms, thighs, feet, fingers and heaps of headsfractured with blood oozing from their limbs and urine flowing out. The earth was also covered withflaming weapons fallen around."
6-74-9,"Vibhishana and Hanuma saw Sugreeva, Angada, Nila, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, Gavaksha,Sushena, Vegadarshi, Mainda, Nala, Jyotimukha and a monkey called Dvivida, who were struck down onthe battle-field."
6-74-10,"Sixty seven crores of powerful monkeys were struck down by the cherished missile ofBrahma, the self-born creator, in the fifth and last period* of the day."
6-74-11,"Hanuma, along with Vibhishana, began to search for Jambavan, while looking at theterrific army (wounded by the arrows) which appeared like the tide of an ocean."
6-74-12,"Looking at Jambavan, the son of Brahma, who was naturally bequeathed with old age,an elderly person, with his body conspicuous of hundreds of arrows and a valiant person lookinglike an extinguishing fire, Vibhishana approached him and spoke as follows:"
6-74-13,"O Vibhishana, the leader of demons, with a great prowess! I am able to recognizeyou by your voice alone. Pierced with sharp arrows, I am not able to see you with my eyes."
6-74-14,"O Vibhishana, of good manners! Does Hanuma, the foremost among monkeys, because ofwhom, Anjana (his mother) and the wind-god are his blessed parents survive, holding his life anywhere nearby?"
6-74-15,"Hearing the words of Jambavana, Vibhishana spoke the following words, ""why do youenquire about Hanuman, passing over the venerable sons of Dasaratha?"""
6-74-16,"O venerable one! The exceptional affection, you are showing towards Hanuma, is notbeing shown towards Sugreeva or Angada or even Rama."
6-74-17,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Jambavan replied as follows: ""O the foremost amongdemons! Listen to me, why I am enquiring about Hanuma."""
6-74-18,"If that brave Hanuma is surviving, the whole army even if killed, is unhurt. On theother hand, if Hanuma has given up is life, we are all dead, even though living."
6-74-19,"O dear child! If Hanuma, who is equal to the wind and the fire in prowess,survives; then there is a hope for all of us to survive.'"
6-74-20,"Thereafter, Hanuma the son of wind-god approaching the elderly Jambavan, offered hissalutation, by grasping the feet of Jambavan with modesty."
6-74-21,"Hearing the voice of Hanuma, Jambavan, the foremost among monkeys, with perturbedsenses, considered himself as though born again."
6-74-22,"Thereafter, that Jambavan of great splendour spoke to Hanuma as follows: ""Come on, Oforemost of monkeys! You ought to protect the lives of monkeys."""
6-74-23,"You are the great companion for these monkeys, by your copious prowess. There is noother person. This is the appropriate time to show your prowess. I do not see any other person todo it."
6-74-24,"Cheer up the martial warriors of both monkeys and bears. Heal Rama and Lakshmanafrom their arrow-wounds."
6-74-25,"O Hanuma! You ought to go to Himalaya, the foremost of mountains, by travelinghigher and higher over the large ocean."
6-74-26,"O annihilator of enemies! Thereafter, you will see there the Mount Rishabha, theexcellent mountain and the very much powerful peak of Kailasa, with a golden hue."
6-74-27,"O valiant Hanuma! In the midst of these two peaks, you will see a blazing andunequally brilliant herbal mountain, containing all kinds of herbs."
6-74-28,"O foremost of monkeys! Sprouted on the head of that mountain, are four blazingherbs. You can see them, illuminating the ten quarters."
6-74-29,"You can see there, Mrita Sanjivani (capable of restoring the dead to life),Vishalyakarani (capable of extracting weapons and healing all wounds inflicted by weapons),Suvarnakarani (restoring the body to its original complexion) and Sandhani, the great herb (capableof joining severed limbs or fractured bone)."
6-74-30,"O Hanuma! Bring all those herbs quickly. O son of wind-god! Bring succour to themonkeys, by injecting lives into them."
6-74-31,"Hearing the words of Jambavan, Hanuma the son of wind-god was infused with animatedstrength, as the ocean gets animated with the force of the wind."
6-74-32,"Standing on the summit of Trikuta mountain and pressing the foremost of mountains(with his feet), that valiant Hanuma appeared like a second mountain."
6-74-33,"Then, increasingly pressed and bent by Hanuma's feet, that mountain was not able tobear its weight and sank."
6-74-34,"The trees on that mountain, pressed by Hanuma, fell to the ground and caught firedue to rapidity of Hanuma. Its peaks also got broken."
6-74-35,"The monkeys were unable to stand on that excellent mountain, which started to reel,while being pressed severely by Hanuma, as the trees standing on it and the rocks got broken."
6-74-36,"Confounded with panic, the City of Lanka, whose principal gates were broken, whosehouses and town-gates were shattered, appeared as though dancing at night."
6-74-37,"Pressing hard the mountain, Hanuma equal to a mountain, caused the earth along withthe ocean to shake."
6-74-38,"From that mountain, Hanuma then ascended Mount Malaya, appearing as Mounts Meru andMandara, filled with several kinds of cascades, full of many trees and creepers, having Kamala andUtpala lotuses blooming, visited by celestials and celestial musicians, having a height of sixtyYojanas (four hundred eighty miles), frequented by Vidyodharas, a number of sages and Apsaras thenymphs, filled with various kinds of animal-troupes and illuminated by many caves, Hanuma grew hisbody, appearing like a cloud, bewildering Yakshas, Gandharvas and Kinnaras."
6-74-39,"Pressing the mountain hard with his feet, opening his terrific mouth which shonelike a submarine fire and frightening the demons, Hanuma roared loudly."
6-74-40,"Hearing his loud noise, roaring clamorously, the foremost of demons residing in theCity of Lanka, were not able to stir anywhere."
6-74-41,"Hanuma of terrific prowess, annihilator of his enemies, after offering salutation tothe ocean, made up his mind to embark on a prime act for the sake of Rama."
6-74-42,"Raising his tail which resembled on serpent, bending his back, contracting his earsand opening his month which shone like a terrific submarines-fire, Hanuma jumped into the sky, witha head long speed."
6-74-43,"By his velocity, he carried away a multitude of trees, mountains and some ordinarymonkeys. Driven up and away by the momentum generated from his arms and thighs, they fell down inwater when their speed diminished."
6-74-44,"Stretching his arms, looking like coils of serpents, that Hanuma vying with theprowess of hostile Garuda the eagle, headed towards the excellent mountain of Himalayas, with gushas though he was drawing away the four quarters."
6-74-45,"Beholding the sea, whose waves along with its water were made to agitate and allwhose creatures were caused to whirl round, Hanuma quickly speeded up, like the discuss loosed bythe fingers of Lord Vishnu."
6-74-46,"Gazing at the hills, flocks of birds, lakes, rivers, pools and excellent towns fullof people, that Hanuma with a speed equal to that of the wind-god his father, shot forth towardsHimalayas."
6-74-47,"That valiant Hanuma, with a prowess equal to that of his father, whose fatigue wasgone, swiftly rushed, taking recourse to the orbit of the sun."
6-74-48,"With a great speed of wind, reverberating the four quarters with sound, Hanuma theforemost of monkeys, hastened towards Himalayas."
6-74-49,"Remembering the words of Jambavan, Hanuma the great monkey with a terrific stride,suddenly saw Mount Himalaya too."
6-74-50,"Hanuma went to Mount Himalaya, the foremost of mountains, embellished with variouskinds of cascades, many kinds of caves, mountain-streams and summits resembling an assemblage ofwhite clouds as also many kinds of trees."
6-74-51,"Having approached that great mountain having excellent overbearing summits, he sawgreat holy hermitages, inhabited by a multitude of divine sages."
6-74-52,"He saw the abode of Brahma the lord of creation, Kailasa the abode of Shiva the lordof dissolution, the abode of Indra the lord of celestials, the arrow-discharging place of Rudra,the worshipping place of Hayagriva, the horse-faced form of Vishnu, the shining place at whichBrahma's head fell down, the sun-god and Kimkaras."
6-74-53,"He saw the abode of Agni the fire-god, the abode of Kubera (son of Visrava) shininglike the sun, the spot where the sun was tied down, the abode of Brahma, the abode of bow belongingto Lord Shiva and the novel of the earth (containing the hole through which one can enter Patalathe nethermost subterranean region)."
6-74-54,"He saw the gigantic Mount Kailasa, the rock of Mount Himalaya (on which Lord Shivais believed to have practiced austerities and abstract meditation) and Mount Rishabha, the loftygolden mountain, which was highly illumined by the flaming herbs and the lord of mountains on whichall types of herbs grew."
6-74-55,"Seeing that mountain shining with a heap of fire, Hanuma the son of wind-god, who isthe envoy of Indra, was surprised to see that great mountain of herbs and then made a search forthe herbs."
6-74-56,"That Hanuma, the great monkey, having crossed thousands of yojanas, walked aroundthat mountain, searching for the heavenly herbs."
6-74-57,"Knowing then that somebody was coming in search of them, all the distinguished herbson that mountain disappeared from Hanuma's view."
6-74-58,"In not seeing them thus, that great souled Hanuma was enraged. He made a loud noisein anger unable to bear it, Hanuma with his eyes as red as the fire, spoke the following words tothe prince of mountains."
6-74-59,"O prince of mountains! Is it quite sure that you have not shown any compassion forRama? If it is so, overcome by the strength of my arms; find yourself shattered to piecestoday."
6-74-60,"Fiercely seizing hold of the top of that mountain, furnished with thousands ofminerals, with its trees, elephants and gold, with the projections of mountain shattered and thecrest of its plateau set on fire, at once sprang up with speed."
6-74-61,"Having uprooted that mountain, frightening the worlds together with the leaders ofcelestials and demons inhabiting them and being praised by many aerial beings, Hanuma sprang upinto the sky and proceeded expeditiously with the terrible speed of Garuda the eagle."
6-74-62,"Grasping that mountain-peak, radiant as the sun, that Hanuma who resembled the sun,having reached the orbit of the sun, shone as a second sun (as sun's image) in the vicinity of thesun."
6-74-63,"In the sky, with that mountain in his hand, that Hanuma the offspring of thewind-god, who resembled a mountain himself, appeared mostly like Vishnu with his flaming discusswith its thousand edges holding his hand."
6-74-64,"Then, seeing Hanuma, the monkeys made a noise. Seeing them, Hanuma in turn roared indelight. Hearing their awfully excessive noises the inhabitants of Lanka roared still moreterribly."
6-74-65,"Thereupon, the great souled Hanuma descended on that prince of mountains (Trikuta)in the midst of that army of monkeys. Having offered salutation to the illustrious monkeys therewith his head bent low, he then embraced Vibhishana"
6-74-66,"By inhaling that fragrance of those great herbs, both Rama and Lakshamana becamehealed of their wounds then and there. Other monkey-warriors rose up."
6-74-67,"By the fragrance of those most powerful herbs, all those monkey-warriors who wereearlier dead were healed momentarily of their wounds, relieved of their pain, even as those who areasleep fully get up at the close of night."
6-74-68,"From the day the monkeys and demons began to fight in Lanka, from that day onwards,under the orders of Ravana, all those demons, who were being killed by the foremost of monkeys werebeing thrown away into the sea as and when they were killed, merely or the sake of honour (so thattheir number may not be known to the monkeys)."
6-74-69,"Then, Hanuma the son of wind-god, with a great speed, carried away that mountain ofherbs quickly back to the mountains of Himalayas and again joined Rama."
6-75-1,"Then, Sugreeva of great majesty, the king of monkeys spoke (the following)meaningful words to Hanuma, in order to inform him what they should do next."
6-75-2,"Since Kumbhakarna and his four sons were killed, Ravana cannot give any defensenow."
6-75-3,"Let those dexterous monkeys, possessing the strength of lions, taking torches intheir hands, rush towards Lanka quickly, in order to set ablaze the abode of Ravana."

6-75-6,"Those monkeys, feeling gladdened, threw fire to the towering gates, attics, streets,various byways and mansions."

6-75-13,"Then, the fire burnt away many kinds of bright coloured houses of all demons, whowere greedily desirous of their homes. The fire there burnt away hundreds and thousands ofinhabitants of Lanka, who were protected by gold coloured armoury and decked with garlands,ornaments and garments, with quivering eyes due to inebriation, moving with lustful walking, whowere seized with fury against their enemy, who carried maces, pikes and swords in their hands, whowere eating and drinking too or lay fast asleep on splendid beds with their loved ones and who weredecamping quickly to all sides, taking their sons with them, frightened and fearing up again andagain."
6-75-14,"The fire there burnt away the houses, which were strong, very valuable, withprofound qualities, decked in gold with moon shapes and crescent shapes, which rose high with theirtop rooms, provided all round with beautiful windows, furnished with seats coaches etc., decoratedwith gems and corals, as though touching the sky, rendered noisy with notes of herons, peacocks,veena the Indian lute and the jingling of ornaments as also appearing like mountains."
6-75-15,"Surrounded by fire, the arch-ways shone like a collection of clouds bound bylightning, at the end of a summer season."
6-75-16,"The houses, surrounded by fire shone like the peaks of a large mountain, ignited bya forest-fire."
6-75-17,"Getting scorched in fire, beautiful women, while lying fast asleep in theirseven-storeyed mansions, gave up all connection with their ornaments and screamed loudly, saying""ah! Alas!"""
6-75-18,"The houses too, surrounded by fire there, fell down like peaks of a great mountain,struck by the thunder-bolt of Indra."

6-75-20,"That City of Lanka at night with its house-tops being burnt ablaze with flames,looked like Kimshuka trees in full bloom."
6-75-21,"With their elephants let loose by the superintendents of the elephants and horsestoo set free, Lanka was like an ocean, with roaming alligators in it at the end of aworld-cycle."
6-75-22,"Here, seeing a horse being let loose, an elephant went back frightened. There,seeing a frightened elephant, a horse turned back with an alarm."
6-75-23,"While Lanka was being burnt, the great ocean, with its image reflected on itswaters, assumed like a great sea with red waters."
6-75-24,"That City burnt by the monkeys, within a short time, became transformed like theearth burning at the time of terrific dissolution of this world."
6-75-25,"The noise of the women-folk, who were burnt by fire and covered with smoke, roaringloudly, was heard upto one hundred Yojanas (or eight hundred miles)."
6-75-26,"Then the monkeys, eager to fight, bounced suddenly upon the other demons, whosebodies had been severely burnt and who rushed out (to save their lives)."
6-75-27,"The loud noise made by the monkeys and the cry of the demons caused resounding ofall the ten quarters, the ocean and the earth."
6-75-28,"Healed of their wounds and unperplexed, both those great souled princes, Rama andLakshmana seized hold of those two excellent bows."
6-75-29,"Thereupon, Rama pulled his excellent bow, making a tumultuous twang, which struckterror in demons."
6-75-30,"Rama, drawing his great bow, was as shining at that time as Lord Shiva (the sourceof Universe), stretching his bow, consisting of the Vedas in a great wrath (as at the time ofdissolution of the Universe)."
6-75-31,"The twang of the bow-string of Rama could be heard above both of those sounds. Thesound of the monkeys and the cry of the demons."
6-75-32,"The raised voice of the monkeys, the cry of the demons and even the twang of Rama'sbow-string these three sounds pervaded all the ten quarters."
6-75-33,"By the arrows released from Rama's bow, the main gate of that City looking like apeak of Mount Kailasa, tumbled down, shattered, to the ground."
6-75-34,"Thereupon, seeing Rama's arrows descending on seven-storeyed mansions and otherhouses, the war-preparedness of the leaders of demons got disturbed."
6-75-35,"To those demoniac leaders, who were preparing for the battle and emitting lion'sroars, that night became a night of final dissolution (presided over by Rudra, the lord ofdestruction)."
6-75-36,"The monkey-chiefs were commanded by Sugreeva as follows: ""O monkeys! Approaching thenearest gate, begin to wage the war. Even though present at the scene of fighting, he among you whoproves futile by an escape, should be overtaken and killed as he will be quality of disobeying theroyal command."""
6-75-37,"Seeing those monkey-chiefs, standing at the gate, with flaming torches in theirhands, Ravana was enraged with fury."
6-75-38,"All the ten directions were distracted because of Ravana's act of disorderlymovement of his body due to yawning and he looked like the wrath manifest in the limbs of Rudraappearing with a form."
6-75-39,"The enraged Ravana sent both Kumbha and Nimkumbha, the sons of Kumbhakarna, alongwith a multitude of demons."
6-75-40,"By the orders of Ravana, Yupaksha, Shonitaksha, Prajangha and Kampana along with theaforesaid sons of Kumbhakarna set out for the battle."
6-75-41,"Ravana instructed all those mighty demons thus, ""O demons! Proceed now itself,bellowing a lion's roar."""
6-75-42,"Incited by Ravana, the valiant demons then, wielding shining weapons and roaringrepeatedly, sallied forth from Lanka."
6-75-43,"By the gleams of ornaments worn by their own natural splendour, those demons andmonkeys with their fires, made the sky fluorescent on all sides."
6-75-44,"The effulgence of the moon there, the light of the stars and the splendour of theornaments of both the armies, while blazing, made the sky brilliant."
6-75-45,"The effulgence of the moon, the splendour of the ornaments and the fluorescence ofthe blazing planets made the armies of monkeys and demons glitter on all sides."
6-75-46,"With the flames of the half-scorched houses there, the ocean on its part with itsagitated waves mingled with water, shone abundantly."
6-75-47,"That army of demons was looking awful with flags and banners, with excellent axesshaped like swords, consisting of terrific horses, chariots and elephants, crowded withfoot-soldiers of every description, distinguished by shining pikes, maces, swords, spears, lancesand bows, noted for its redoubtable valour and prowess, with shining lances and rendered noisy byhundreds of tiny bells (tied around chariots, elephants etc), the arms of its warriors adorned withsets of gold ornaments, their axes being brandished, mighty weapons being waved about, arrowsfitted to the bows and the whole atmosphere rendered fragrant by the abundance of sandal paste,garlands and wine."
6-75-48,"Seeing the army of demons, which came crowded with gallant warriors, thundered likea huge cloud which was difficult to assail, the army of monkeys marched forth and made a loudnoise."
6-75-49,"That large army of demons on its part went springing forward with all speed, towardsthe hostile army, as moths towards a flame."
6-75-50,"The excellent army of those demons, in which iron clubs and the tips of missilesbeing brandished through the action of their arms, shone all the more brightly."
6-75-51,"Thereafter, the monkeys desirous to fight there, striking the demons with trees,rocks and fists, jumped up as though frenzied."
6-75-52,"Likewise, the demons with their terrific prowess instantly tore off the heads ofthose monkeys bouncing upon them, with sharp arrows."
6-75-53,"The demons there strolled in the streets of Lanka, with their ears bitten off withteeth, their skulls smashed with fists and their limbs broken by crag blows."
6-75-54,"Even so, some demons with terrific form struck those chiefs among the monkeys, withsharp swords, on all sides of the battle field."
6-75-55,"One warrior killed the one who was killing another, a second one threw down the onethrowing down another; a third one scolded another who was scolding the other one; while a fourthone chewed the one chewing another."
6-75-56,"There, one said ""Give me the blow. Another said, ""He is giving"". Yet another said,""I am giving"" some talked with one another, saying ""Wait. Why do you take pains?"""
6-75-57,"In that very terrific war between monkeys and demons, some weapons were made futile.Some weapons were dug into armours. Long lances were lifted up. Fists, pikes, swords and spearswere used as weapons of war."
6-75-58,"In the battle-front, the demons killed monkeys in tens and sevens. The monkeys toothrew the demons down in tens and sevens."
6-75-59,"Catching hold of the army of demons, whose hair and raiment's were kept in orderwith difficulty and whose armours and standards were thrown away, the monkeys surrounded them onall sides."
6-76-1,"While that terrific battle, which destroyed many eminent heroes, was in progress,Angada, who was eager to fight, attacked the valiant Kampana."
6-76-2,"Calling Angada to fight, Kampana with fury, rapidly struck him with a mace inanticipation. Violently hit by him, Angada was reeled."
6-76-3,"Restoring consciousness, the energetic Angada hurled a mountain peak. Tormented bythat stroke, Kampana fell down on the ground."
6-76-4,"Then, seeing Kampana killed in battle, Shonitaksha fearlessly rushed there towardsAngada quickly in a chariot."
6-76-5,"He then swiftly struck Angada with sharp pointed arrows which can tear up the limbsand with fire-like forms which can destroy the world. He struck with many sharp arrows by the namesof Kshura, Kshurapra, Naaraacha, Vatsatanta, Shilimukha, Karni, Shalya and Vipatha."
6-76-6,"The strong and powerful Angada, the son of Vali, with his wounded limbs, crushed histerrific bow, chariot and darts with his might."
6-76-7,"Then, Shonitaksha quickly took a sword and a shield. Enraged as he was, he swiftlyjumped down (from his chariot) unhesitatingly."
6-76-8,"Springing forward more swiftly, seizing hold of him with his hand and snatching awaythe sword, the strong Angada made a lion's roar."
6-76-9,"Angada the foremost of monkeys the sword into the flat surface of his shoulder andcut him from left to right diagonally."
6-76-10,"Taking hold of that large sword and repeatedly roaring, Angada rushed towards theother surviving enemies in the battle-front."

6-76-12,"That valiant Shonitaksha, wearing golden armlets, restoring his consciousness, tookan iron mace and rushed quickly towards the same Angada."
6-76-13,"The strong and the great warrior, Prajangha on his part, along with Yupaksha, wasenraged and rushed towards the mighty Angada with his mace."
6-76-14,"Angada, the chief of monkeys, between the two warriors, Shonitaksha and Prajangha,shone like a full moon between the two asterisms known as Vishakhas."
6-76-15,"Protecting Angada, Mainda and Dvivida took their position near Angada, with anintent to exhibit each of their own martial skill."
6-76-16,"The mighty demons with their colossal bodies retaliated and rushed in anger,wielding swords, arrows and maces, towards the monkeys."
6-76-17,"A great battle, causing hair to stand on end, was waged by the three monkey-chiefswho encountered the three excellent demons."
6-76-18,"In the battle-field, the monkeys, seizing hold of trees, hurled them against thedemon-chiefs. The mighty Prajangha, however, cut them down with his sword."
6-76-19,"The monkeys in the battle-field hurled trees and rocks towards chariots and horses.The mighty Yupaksha chopped them off with a flood of arrows."
6-76-20,"Shonitaksha, the valiant and the powerful demon, chopped off the trees uplifted andhurled by Dvivida and Mainda with his mace in the midway itself."
6-76-21,"Prajangha, lifting a large sword, which can chop off vital parts of the enemies,rushed swiftly towards Angada."
6-76-22,"Then the mighty Angada, who was exceedingly strong, seeing him coming nearer, struckhim with an Ashvakarna tree."
6-76-23,"Angada struck, with his fist, the arm of Prajangha, holding the sword. By that blow,the sword fell on the ground."
6-76-24,"Seeing that sword looking like a pebble (in shape), which fell on the ground, themighty Prajangha tightened his thunderbolt like fist."
6-76-25,"When that Prajangha of great splendour struck Angaa, the excellent monkey with agreat strength on his forehead, Angada shuddered for a moment."
6-76-26,"That Angada of splendour and prowess, restoring his consciousness, struck with hisfist and shattered Prajangha's head off his trunk."
6-76-27,"That Yupaksha, with tears filled in his eyes because of the death of his paternaluncle in battle, quickly took a sword as his arrows were exhausted and descended from hischariot."
6-76-28,"Seeing that Yupaksha rushing on him, Dvivida hurriedly struck Yupaksha on his chestand with a rage, forcibly caught hold of him."
6-76-29,"Seeing his mighty brother being seized, Shonitaksha, of great splendour, then struckDvivida on his chest."
6-76-30,"That mighty Dvivida, struck by Shonitaksha was tottered; but pulled off theplatter's mace when lifted again on him."
6-76-31,"Meanwhile, Mainda came nearer to Dvivida and banged Yupaksha on his chest with hispalm."
6-76-32,"Those two demons, Shonitaksha and Yupaksha, who were full of violence, carried on akeen contest with the two monkeys in the battle field, by pulling and overthrowing them vehementlyand severely."
6-76-33,"The valiant Dvivida, after splitting open shonitaksha's face with his claws, threwhim down on the floor by his strength and crushed him down."
6-76-34,"Mainda, the foremost of monkeys, was enraged and pressed Yupaksha with his arms.Yupaksha fell down dead on the ground."
6-76-35,"That army of demons, which was perturbed with their great warriors killed, thenmoved with its face turned towards the place where Kumbha (the son of Kumbhakarna) was carrying onbattle."
6-76-36,"Kumbha, restored to confidence, that army which was coming towards him with speed.Then, seeing the army of demons whose chief-warriors were thrown down by the most powerful monkeyswho could fulfill their aim, the powerful Kumbha then performed a great feat which was verydifficult to do in a battle."
6-76-37,"That Kumbha, the foremost among the wielders of bow, taking his bow and fullycomposed, released serpentine arrows which can split open the bodies."
6-76-38,"That excellent bow of his, fitted with an arrow, shone like a second bow of Indra(the rain-god), illumined by flashes of lightning and the splendour of Airavata (the elephantcarrying Indra on its back)."
6-76-39,"By that arrow with a golden shaft and fastened with feathers, drawn upto his ear anddischarged, he then struck Dvivida."
6-76-40,"Suddenly struck by that arrow, that excellent monkey possessing a splendour of MountTrikuta, was perturbed, with his feet swaying to and fro and fell down throbbing."
6-76-41,"Beholding his brother defeated in that great battle, Mainda there on his part,taking a large rock, rushed with speed to attack the demon."
6-76-42,"While that mighty Mainda hurled that rock towards the demon, Kumbha broke that rockinto pieces with his five shining arrows."
6-76-43,"Stretching another arrow resembling a serpent and with a good pointed tip, Kumbha ofa great splendour, struck it on the chest of Mainda the brother of Dvivida."
6-76-44,"As that blow of Kumbha's arrow struck that Mainda, the monkey-chief, on his vitalparts, he fell unconscious on the ground."
6-76-45,"Seeing both his mighty maternal uncles wounded, Angada rushed speedily towardsKumbha, who was standing with his bow uplifted."
6-76-46,"With five steel arrows and with three other sharp-edged arrows, Kumbha pierced thatAngada advancing towards him, as on would pierce an elephant with goads."
6-76-47,"That valiant Kumbha pierced Angada with a multiple of sharp arrows, decked in gold,with edges which were harsh and sharp."
6-76-48,"Angada, the son of wind-god, though pierced all over the body with sharp arrows, washowever not shaken. He showered a rain of rocks and trees on Kumbha's head."
6-76-49,"The glorious Kumbha the son of Kumbhakarna chopped off all those trees hurled byAngada and burst off the rocks further."
6-76-50,"Seeing Angada the monkey-chief rushing upon him, Kumbha pierced his brows with hisbrows with his arrows, as an elephant would be struck with flaming torches."
6-76-51,"Since Angada's blood was oozing out, his eyes were covered with blood; Covering hiseyes, dampened with blood, with one hand, he caught hold of a Sala tree nearby with anotherhand."
6-76-52,"In the battle-field, propping that tree with branches and all, on his chest, holdingit with his hand and bending a little, Angada uprooted it from the ground."
6-76-53,"While all the demons were looking on, Angada hurled that tree-which was tall likeIndra's banner and resembled Mount Mandara in size."
6-76-54,"That Kumbha chopped off that tree with seven sharp arrows which were capable ofsplitting asunder the body. That Angada was very much perturbed and fell down, swooning."
6-76-55,"Seeing the unconquerable Angada fallen down and sinking into depression as though inan ocean, the monkey-chiefs informed the matter to Rama."
6-76-56,"Hearing of Angada being seized with anguish in that great combat, Rama sent out forhelp, leaders of monkeys, headed by Jambavan."
6-76-57,"Hearing Rama's message, those excellent monkeys were very much enraged and quicklyrushed towards Kumbha who was wielding a bow in his hand."
6-76-58,"With an intent to defend Angada, the monkey-chiefs then holding trees and rocks intheir hands and with their furious blood-red eyes, rushed on."
6-76-59,"The enraged Jambavan, Sushena and Vegadarshi, the monkey ran up towards Kumbha theson of Kumbhakarna to attack him."
6-76-60,"Seeing those mighty monkey-chiefs coming nearer to him, Kumbha covered them with aflood of arrows, as one would obstruct the course of a stream by means of a rock."
6-76-61,"Reaching the range of his arrows, the great souled monkey-chiefs were unable even tolook at him, much less advance towards him, any more than a great ocean would overstep itsshore."
6-76-62,"Seeing those troops of monkeys being tormented by a flood of arrows, Sugreeva theking of monkeys, keeping Angada his brother's son in the rear, rushed headlong towards Kumbha inthe battle, as a swift lion would bounce upon an elephant walking along the slopes of amountain."
6-76-63,"Uprooting many large trees beginning with Ashvakarna and many kinds of trees,Sugreeva the king of monkeys hurled them on Kumbha."
6-76-64,"The illustrious Kumbha, the son of Kumbhakarna, with his sharp arrows, chopped offthat down pour of trees, which was obscuring the sky and which was difficult to be assailed."
6-76-65,"The trees, chopped off with his sharp arrows by the brutal Kumbha, skilled inhitting his target, shone like terrific Shataghnis (stones or cylindrical pieces of wood studdedwith iron spikes)."
6-76-66,"Seeing that shower of trees chopped off by Kumbha, the mighty and illustriousSugreeva of valour was not disturbed."
6-76-67,"Enduring those arrows being hit, Sugreeva snatched away Kumbha's bow, possessing thesplendour of a rain-bow and broke it all at once."
6-76-68,"Thus bouncing swiftly and doing that most difficult task, the enraged Sugreeva spoke(as follows) to Kumbha, who was looking like an elephant with a broken tusk."
6-76-69,"O Kumbha, the elder brother of Nikumbha! Both your prowess and the swiftness ofyour arrow are wonderful. Both Ravana and you are equal in complaisance towards demons and themajesty too exists."
6-76-70,"O Kumbha, the compeer of Prahlada, Bali, Indra (the destroyer of the demon Vritra),Kubera (the god of riches) and Varuna (the god of water)! You alone are born with a likeness ofyour father (Kumbhakarna) who was exceedingly strong."
6-76-71,"The celestials cannot surpass even you alone, with a spike in hand, who can destroythe enemy with your large arms, as mental agonies cannot overwhelm the one who subdued his senses.Hence, exhibit your prowess, O demon of great intellect and see my exploits."
6-76-72,"Because of the boon received by him, Ravana your uncle is able to attack thecelestials and demons. But Kumbhakarna (your father) on his part is tolerating the celestials anddemons."
6-76-73,"You are equal in archery to Indrajit and in prowess to Ravana. Hence, you are nowthe foremost in strength and heroism among the demon-folk."
6-76-74,"Let the created beings see your great wonderful fight with me in the battle fieldtoday, as they saw that fight between Indra and Shambara, the demon."
6-76-75,"You have performed an incomparable task. You have also shown your skill in missileweaponry. You have struck down these monkey-heroes possessing a terrific prowess."
6-76-76,"O valiant demon! Since you look tired after performing your martial duty, I did notkill you, with a fear of public censure. Identify my strength, after taking some rest."
6-76-77,"Kumbha was thus honoured with those insulting words of Sugreeva. Kumbha's splendourthen enhanced, like the splendour of the sacrificial fire, when a melted butter is offered to it asan oblation."""
6-76-78,"The reopen, Kumbha pressingly clasped Sugreeva in his arms. Then, they stoodbreathing heavily again and again as elephants in rut, having their bodies fastened against eachother, rubbing one another and emitting a flame to blaze with smoke from their faces because oftheir fatigue."
6-76-79,"The battle-ground sank under the trampling of their feet. With their waves whirledabout, the ocean became turbulent."
6-76-80,"Then tossing up Kumbha, Sugreeva threw him down speedily into the ocean, showing himthe bottom of the sea."
6-76-81,"Due to the hurling down of Kumbha, the fully risen sea, reaching a height of as tothat of Mount Vindhya, diffused on all sides."
6-76-82,"The enraged Kumbha, then jumping up and throwing down Sugreeva, struck him on hischest with his thunderbolt-like fist."
6-76-83,"Sugreeva's armour was burst asunder. Even blood appeared oozing out of his chest.His cage of bones gave a counter-strike to that awfully forceful fist."
6-76-84,"Then, by the force of that fist shot forth there, a mighty flame resembling the firethat bursts up on Mount Meru, was born out of a stroke of lightning."
6-76-85,"Thus struck by Kumbha there, that mighty Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys, tightenedhis fist which appeared like a thunderbolt."
6-76-86,"The valiant Sugreeva forcefully descended his fist, which shone like the solar discencircled by a thousand rays, on the breast of Kumbha."
6-76-87,"That Kumbha, very much hurt by that blow, was exhausted and then fell down, likefire whose flame has extinguished."
6-76-88,"Thus struck with Sugreeva's fist, that demon fell down suddenly, as the planet Mars,of splendid rays, would drop down from the sky accidentally."
6-76-89,"When Kumbha was killed in battle by Sugreeva the chief of monkeys, possessing aterrific prowess, the earth with its mountains and forests trembled. Too much fear seized thedemons."
6-77-1,"Seeing his brother stretched on the ground, Nikumbha cast angry looks at Sugreeva, as it would burn him into ashes."
6-77-2,"Then, Nikumbha of firm mind grasped his iron club, stupendous like the crest of Mount Mandara and which was bright, festooned with wreaths and provided with iron plates, measuring five digits in breadth."
6-77-3,"Round it ran a broad strip of gold while diamonds and rubies studded it all over. Like the death-dealing rod of Yama, it seemed causing dismay to the monkeys and nerving the demons with courage."
6-77-4,"Wielding that weapon, which in size resembled the flag-staff of Indra, Nikumbha of terrific prowess, roared with his mouth yawing wide."
6-77-5,"On his chest shone a medal of gold. His arms were held by beautiful bracelets. Lustrous pendants depended from his ear. Resplendent garland enfolded his neck. With these ornaments and with his club, Nikumbha assumed the threatening semblance of a cloud, with lightning and thunder and shot with a vivid rainbow."
6-77-6,"The strong Nikumbha, with his arms as strong as his club, hurled his club having sun-like splendour, on the breast of that mighty Hanuma."
6-77-7,"The sky above appeared whirled around in the toss of Nikumbha&#39;s club, as though Alaka the City with the palaces of Gandharvas performed rapid revolutions and the moon and the stars and the planets joining the rotating race."
6-77-8,"The hot tempered fire of Nikumbha, which had his club and ornaments for its flame and his fury as its fuel, became dangerous to be approached, like the fire rising at the time of dissolution of the world."
6-77-9,"The demons and the monkeys too, out of fear, were unable even to make the slightest movement. The mighty Hanuma, on his part, stood alone among them, with his breast bared to the fury of the attack, in front of Nikumbha."
6-77-10,"The strong Nikumbha, with his arms as strong as his club, hurled his club having sun-like splendour, on the breast of that mighty Hanuma."
6-77-11,"The titanic club, which fell on the wide and rock-like chest of Hanuma, at once shattered into hundreds of fragments, like hundreds of meteors shattering into the sky."
6-77-12,"That Hanuma, struck by that blow of the club, was unmoved like a mountain in an earthquake."
6-77-13,"Thus struck by him, the mighty Hanuma the monkey-chief clenched his fist forcibly."
6-77-14,"The greatly splendoured, powerful and swift Hanuma, with the violence of the wind-god, his father, lifting that fist, struck it against, Nikumbha&#39;s breast with force."
6-77-15,"By the blow of that fist there, his armour got split up and red blood profusely oozed out, as a black cloud streaked suddenly with fierce lightning."
6-77-16,"But, by that blow, Nikumbha was unmoved, recovered soon and grasped the unwieldy bulk of Hanuma."
6-77-17,"Seeing the mighty Hanuma lifted off the ground in battle, loud roar of exultant joy rose from the ranks of demons."
6-77-18,"Eventhough he was being carried off in that way by that demon, Hanuma the son of wind-god, struck him with his thunderbolt-like fist."
6-77-19,"Freeing himself from Nikumbha, Hanuma the son of wind-god then threw him down on the ground and treated him with blows."
6-77-20,"Throwing down Nikumbha by main force and with a supreme effort, Hanuma descended on him, leaped on his chest and pounded it mercilessly."
6-77-21,"Then with both hands, he caught the enemy&#39;s neck, twisted it about and tore off his huge head, while Nikumbha was horribly roaring."
6-77-22,"Then, while the roaring Nikumbha was killed in battle by Hanuma, there ensued an exceedingly terrific struggle between the enraged Rama and Makaraksha, son of Khara, a ruler of demons."
6-77-23,"When it was clear that Nikumbha had expired, the monkeys shouted with glee, the quarters thundered with satisfaction, the earth rocked with joy, the heaven appeared to crumble and fear seized the army of demons."
6-78-1,"On hearing of Nikumbha and Kumbha having been killed, Ravana was very much flared uplike fire."
6-78-2,"Engulfed with both anger and sorrow, Ravana ordered the wide-eyed Makaraksha, theson of Khara (as follows):"
6-78-3,"I am commanding you! Accompanied by an army, go my son! Kill Rama, Lakshmana andthe monkeys."
6-78-4,"Hearing Ravana's words, Makaraksha, the son of Khara, thinking himself as a hero,was rejoiced and assured Ravana that he would do it certainly as commanded."
6-78-5,"Having respectfully saluted, even by performing circumambulation, the mightyMakaraksha, by the orders of Ravana, came forth from these shining palace of Ravana."
6-78-6,"Makaraksha the son of Khara asked the commander of an army who was in the vicinityto bring a chariot and the army swiftly."
6-78-7,"Hearing his words, the army-commander of the demons brought the chariot and the armyto his proximity."
6-78-8,"Walking clockwise round the chariot and ascending it, Makaraksha asked thecharioteer to drive forward the chariot quickly to the battle-field."
6-78-9,"Then Makaraksha spoke the following words to those demons, ""O demons! All of youbegin your fight before my presence."""
6-78-10,"The mighty Ravana, the king of demons commanded me to kill both Rama and Lakshmanain battle."
6-78-11,"Today, I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, Sugreeva the monkey and the other monkeys withmy excellent arrows, O demons!"
6-78-12,"By hurling the spears, I will destroy completely the huge army of monkeys whoarrived today to the battle-field, as the fire destroys the dry wood."
6-78-13,"Hearing those words of Makaraksha, all those strong demons, wielding various kindsof weapons, were steadfast to fight."
6-78-14,"Those cruel demons, who can change their forms at will, who had protruding tusks,had tawny coloured eyes, had their disheveled hair, creating terror with their colossal bodies,then marched forward like roaring elephants, shaking the firmament and surrounded the huge-bodiedMakaraksha."
6-78-15,"There arose a great tumult sounded, on all sides, of thousands of couches andkettle-drums including leonine roars and clapping of arms."
6-78-16,"The long whip then slipped down from the hands of Makaraksha's charioteer and theflag-staff of that demon also suddenly fell down by the will of the province."
6-78-17,"Those horses, yoked to his chariot, deprived of their diversified gait, were walkingwith flurried feet and went timidly, with tears in their eyes."
6-78-18,"At the time of marching of that dreadful and evil-minded Makaraksha, a harsh andfearful dust-storm blew forth."
6-78-19,"Though seeing those portents, all those highly valiant demons ignored them and setout to the place, where both Rama and Lakshmana were there."
6-78-20,"Saying thunderously, ""I shall take the lead"", those demons who resembled blackclouds, elephants and buffaloes in hue, who had been wounded pointedly more than once by maces andswords in the battle-front and who were skilled in martial art, moved hither and thither in thebattle-field."
6-79-1,"On seeing Markaraksha come out, all those chiefs of monkeys, leaping all at once,took their positions, with intent to give fight."
6-79-2,"Thereafter, a very great battle ensued between monkeys and demons, which causedone's hair to bristle, like the encounter between celestials and demons."
6-79-3,"The monkeys and demons then, by hurling trees and spikes and by throwing maces andclubs, began to crush each other."
6-79-4,"Those demons, who were prowlers of might, made a slaughter of the lions among themonkeys, by means of their javelins, swords, maces, spears, lances, sharp edged spears, Bhindipalas(slings for throwing stones), nooses, mallets, staffs, missiles and other weapons and by throwingarrows on all sides."
6-79-5,"Tormented by Makaraksha with a multitude of arrows, all the monkeys were bewilderedin mind, agonized with fear and ran away."
6-79-6,"On seeing those monkeys fleeing, all the arrogant demons roared like lions, assuminga triumphant feeling."
6-79-7,"While those monkeys were fleeing on all sides, Rama then, with a shower of arrows,intercepted those demons on that occasion."
6-79-8,"Seeing Rama thus interrupting the demons, Makaraksha, the demon, engrossed in a fireof anger, spoke the following words:"
6-79-9,"Pause, O Rama! You will have a dual with me. I will make your life to quit, by thesharp arrows discharged from my bow."
6-79-10,"Since you killed my father on that day in Dandaka forest, my anger is still growingviolent, when I think of you engaged in such nefarious acts."
6-79-11,"O evil minded Rama! Since you were not being seen by me from that time in thatlarge forest, my limbs were getting very much fumed."
6-79-12,"By a good fortune, you came into my sight here, O Rama! You are being sought by me,as a lion in hunger seeks other animal to eat."
6-79-13,"Now, by the flight of my arrows, you will go to the world of Death and reside therewith those warriors, who were killed by you earlier."
6-79-14,"O Rama! What is the use, by telling too much on this topic? Hear my words. All theworlds will look at you and me, in this battle-front."
6-79-15,"O Rama! The battle will proceed in the battle-field, either with the weapons, orwith a mace or by our arms or by any other means as learnt by you."
6-79-16,"Hearing the words of Makaraksha, Rama the son of Dasaratha laughingly spoke thefollowing words to him, who was still talking further and further (without interruption)."
6-79-17,"O demon! Why are you boasting yourself with so many unworthy words, in vain?Without fighting in the battle-field, it is well nigh impossible for you to attain victory with thestrength of a mere speech."
6-79-18,"I killed fourteen thousand demons along with Khara your father, Trishira and evenDushana in Dandaka forest."
6-79-19,"O sinful one! Today, vultures jackals and crows with their sharp beaks andgoad-like claws will be satiated with your flesh."
6-79-20,"Hearing Rama's words, the mighty Makaraksha discharged a multitude of arrows on thatRama in the battle-field."
6-79-21,"Rama tore those arrows in many ways, by his array of arrows. Those arrows, whichwere provided with golden shafts, fell to the ground, when torn in thousands."
6-79-22,"That battle raged furiously, on their meeting each other there, between Makarakshathe son of Khara the demon and Rama the son of Dasaratha."
6-79-23,"Then, the sound emanated by the bows, with a great resonance, was heard on thebattle-front, like the rumbling of clouds in space."
6-79-24,"With an intent to see that wonderful battle, all the celestials, the demons, thecelestial musicians kinnaras the mythical beings and Mahoragas the great serpents reached thesky."
6-79-25,"Though the limbs of both were pierced by each other, their strength was redoubled.The two warriors inflicted wounds on each other, returned the blows of the other in thebattle-front and continued the combat."
6-79-26,"In the battle, that demon broke the multitude of arrows discharged by Rama. Ramasnapped off, in many ways, the arrows released by the demon."
6-79-27,"All the four quarters and the intermediate points were diffused with a multitude ofarrows. Even the earth was covered on all sides and did not become visible."
6-79-28,"Then, the long-armed Rama, full of anger in battle, broke off the bow of the demon.Thereupon, by his eight iron arrows, struck the charioteer."
6-79-29,"Rama, breaking the chariot with his arrows and killing its horses, made them to falldown dead. That Makaraksha the demon, bereft of his chariot, stood on the ground."
6-79-30,"That demon, standing on the ground, took into his hand, a spike, which createdfright among all living beings and whose splendour was equal to the fire at the end of theworld."
6-79-31,"That great spike, which was difficult to be obtained, was gifted to him by Rudra,one of the eight forms of Shiva the Lord of Dissolution. That terrible spike, which flamedviolently in the sky, looked like another new weapon of destruction of the world. On seeing it, allthe godheads were afflicted with fear and fled to different quarters."
6-79-32,"Brandishing that flaming great spike, that enraged demon hurled it against thatgreat-souled rama."
6-79-33,"Rama broke, by his four arrows, that flaming spike coming forth from Makaraksha'sarm and rushing towards him in the sky."
6-79-34,"That spike, adored with charming gold, broken in many ways, struck by Rama's arrows,fell scattered on the earth, like a mighty meteor."
6-79-35,"Seeing that spike struck by Rama, who was unwearied in action, the beings standingin the air, cried, saying 'Excellent, Excellent!'."
6-79-36,"Seeing that spike destroyed, Makaraksha the demon, rising his fist, called out toRama, saying ""Wait, Wait!""."
6-79-37,"Then, seeing Makaraksha rushing towards him, that Rama the delight of Raghu dynasty,while smiling, fitted to his bow, a mystic missile presided over by fire."
6-79-38,"Struck by that missile by Rama, the demon with his heart split open, fell down deadthen and there, in the battle-field."
6-79-39,"Seeing the fall of Makaraksha, all those demons, tormented by the fear of Rama'sarrows, ran away straight to Lanka."
6-79-40,"Thrilled with delight, the celestials watched that demon, the son of Khara,destroyed by the flights of Rama's arrows and resembling a mountain shattered, after struck bylightning."
6-80-1,"On hearing Makaraksha having been killed, Ravana who had been ever victorious inbattle, grinding his teeth in rage, reflected on what to do then and there, and as greatly furiousas he was, instructed Indrajit, his son to proceed to the battle-field."
6-80-2,"O hero! Either remaining yourself invisible or visible, kill Rama and Lakshmana,the brothers of great prowess. You are superior in strength by all means."
6-80-3,"You have conquered Indra, of incomparable deeds, in battle. Can you not kill thosetwo men, on seeing them in the battle-field?"
6-80-4,"Hearing the words of Ravana, that Indrajit, bowing to the command of his father,poured oblations into the sacred fire, with due ceremony, on the sacrificial ground."
6-80-5,"Even as he was pouring oblations into the sacred fire there, the female-demonscarrying red turbans (for the use of priests) hastily arrived at the spot where Indrajit wasthere."
6-80-6,"Weapons (such as a lance) served as blades of Shara grass (for being spread aroundthe sacrificial fire). Chips of wood of Vibhitaka tree served as wooden sticks to feed thesacrificial fire as also red robes and iron ladles were used for cleaning and pouring clarifiedmelted butter into the sacrificial fire."
6-80-7,"Having spread on the ground around all the sides of the sacrificial fire with otherweapons along with lances, the demon seized hold of the neck of a live goat, entirely black andconsigned it to the fire."
6-80-8,"Such omens as betokened victory appeared in the smokeless fire which burst intomighty flames, when it was fully aroused by that single offering."
6-80-9,"Becoming visible in person, the god of fire, who was shooting out flames towards theright and who shone brightly like refined gold, received that offering."
6-80-10,"Offering oblations in fire and gratifying the gods, the devils and demons, Indrajitascended an excellent and splendid chariot, capable of disappearing from sight."
6-80-11,"Drawn by four horses, provided with sharp arrows and a mighty bow placed on it, thatexcellent chariot looked beautiful."
6-80-12,"Adorned with gold, that chariot glittered on account of its body and was decoratedwith carved images of antelopes, full moons and crescents."
6-80-13,"The flag-post of Indrajit shone like a flaming fire, provided, as it was, with largerings of gold and decorated with cat's eye gems."
6-80-14,"Protected by the missile presided over by Brahma, which was as efflugent as the sun,that Indrajit endowed with exceptional strength, became difficult to be attacked."
6-80-15,"Coming forth from the city and having acquired the capacity of vanishing from thesight, by offering oblations into the sacred fire, with the uttereance of spells sacred to demons,that indrajit, who was ever victorious in war, spoke as follows:"
6-80-16,"By killing both the princes who left home to become religious mendicants in theforest in vain, I will present a gift of victory secured in the battle, to my father, Ravanatoday."
6-80-17,"By making the earth bereft of monkeys today and by killing Rama and Lakshmana, Iwill create a great spleasure. Thus speaking, Indrajit vanished from thes sight."
6-80-18,"Impelled, as he was, by Ravana, the fiery Indrajit, with his barbarons bow and steelarrows, swiftly came to the battle-field enraged."
6-80-19,"That Indrajit saw the two heroes, showering a multitude of arrows. Both the princes,having mighty prowess, looked like three- hooded serpents in the middle of the monkeys."
6-80-20,"Concluding that both of them were the two princes, Rama and Lakshmana and stringinghis bow, he covered them with a flood of arrows, as the rainy clouds do."
6-80-21,"That Indrajit with his chariot, reaching the sky and remaining invisible, struckRama and Lakshmana with his sharp arrows."
6-80-22,"When enveloped by a stream of arrows Rama and Lakshamana, fitted arrows to theirbows and revealed divine missiles."
6-80-23,"Though covering the sky with a net-work of arrows, the two mighty princes could nottouch Indrajit with their arrows charged with mystic missiles and which were efflugent like thesun."
6-80-24,"Covering the sky, the illustrious Indrajit created a dark-like smoke. He made thequarters also invisible, by enclosing them with mist-liek darkness."
6-80-25,"While Indrajit was moving about, neither the sound produced by the impact of hispalm on the bow string was heard, nor the sound of his wheels or the clattering of hoofs of hishorses could be heard, nor did his form come tot he view."
6-80-26,"In that thick darkness, that long-armed Indrajit showered hails of his steel arrows,like wonderful shower of rocks."
6-80-27,"That enraged Indrajit in battle, abundantly pierced Rama in all his limbs with hisarrows, which were earlier granted as boons to him and which were effluent like the sun."
6-80-28,"Both Rama and Lakshmana, the foremost of men, who were being struck with steelarrows, like two mountains being hit by torrents, released sharp golden-shafted arrows."
6-80-29,"Those arrows, adorned with plumes of heron, reaching Indrajit in the sky andpiercing him, fell to the ground, soaked in blood."
6-80-30,"Shining beyond measure with a flood of arrows, the two excellent men began to chopoff those arrows which were falling on them with many arrows called by the name of Bhallas."
6-80-31,"Both Rama and Lakshmana for their part directed their excellent missiles in thedirection from which they saw the aforesaid sharp arrows, fallen."
6-80-32,"Indrajit for his part, who was a superior chariot-warrior and who was swift indischarging missiles, rushed on towards all sides and pierced Rama and Lakshmana with his sharparrows."
6-80-33,"Those valiant princes, Rama and Lakshmana pierced deeply with well-made goldneshafted arrows, appeared like two Kamshuka trees in flowering."
6-80-34,"No one could perceive his rapid movement, like the position of the sun when the skyis thickly overcast with clouds, nor his form nor his bows and arrows, nor any other thing abouthim whatsoever could be known."
6-80-35,"Struck down by him, the monkeys were killed. The monkeys dropped dead in hundreds onthe earth's surface there."
6-80-36,"Then, Lakshmana for his part was enraged and told his brother that he would employthe missile presided over by Brahma for the purpose of killing all the demons."
6-80-37,"Then, Rama spoke to that Lakshmana, who was endowed with auspicious bodily marks asfollows: ""You ought not to kill all the demons on earth, merely for the sake of a singledemon."""
6-80-38,"You ought not to kill on this earth one who is not fighting or one who is hiding orone who seeks refuge with joined palms or is fleeing or is intoxicated."
6-80-39,"O long-armed Lakshmana! We shall try to kill Indrajit alone. We will employ mysticmssiles with great impetuosity and which are equal to venomous serpents."
6-80-40,"On seeing this demons, the leaders of mokey-troops will forcibly kill this pettydemon, who is skilled in conjuring tricks and whose chariot remains invisible."
6-80-41,"Scorched by my mystic missiles, he will fall dead on the ground, even if he entersthe earth or into heaven or into the subterrranean world or penetrates the vault of heaven andremains completely hidden in this manner."
6-80-42,"Speaking highly meaningful words in the aforesaid manner, the great-souled Rama,surrounded by the foremost of monkeys, started to reflect on the speedy means of killing thefurious Indrajit, the demons of cruel deeds."
6-81-1,"Guessing the mind of that great-souled Rama, Indrajit turning away from that battle,entered the City."
6-81-2,"Then, recalling the killing of those energetic demons like Kumbhakarna and others,that valiant Indrajit sallied forth (for the fight) with red-hot eyes in anger."
6-81-3,"That Indrajit, of very great prowess, the adversary of gods and who was born in SagePulstya's dynasty, accompanied by an army of demons, came forth from the western gate."
6-81-4,"Seeing the two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshamana, who were prepared for theencounter, Indrajit for his part, then started to demonstrate his conjuring tricks."
6-81-5,"Placing an illusory image of Seetha on his chariot and a large army surrounding thechariot, Indrajit intended to kill her."
6-81-6,"Making up his mind to purposefully confuse all, by playing a trick to kill Seetha'sillusory image, the exceedingly evil-minded Indrajit sallied forth towards the direction of themonkeys."
6-81-7,"Seeing him coming forth towards their direction, all those monkeys were enraged andbounced towards him, with rocks in their hands and with an intent to fight."
6-81-8,"Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, taking hold of a very large mountain-peak,which was difficult to be reached by others, marched in front."
6-81-9,"That Hanuma saw Seetha, the wife of Rama, the best among women, bereft of joy,wearing only a single braid of hair, looking miserable, with her face emaciated due to fasting,dressed in a single worn-out clothing, unadorned and with all her limbs covered with dust and dirt;in the chaiot of Indrajit."
6-81-10,"On seeing her for a moment, Hanuma ascertained her as Seetha and became dejected.That Seetha was indeed seen by him, not long ago."
6-81-11,"Seeing her stricken with grief bereft of joy, looking distreseed, miserable andsitting under the sway of Indrajit, Hanuma wondered as to what his intention might be. Thusthinking, he along with those leaders of mnkeys, rushed towards Indrajit."
6-81-12,"Beholding that army of monkeys, Indrajit was excited with anger, pulled Seetha bythe hair on her head and unsheathed his sword."
6-81-13,"While those monkeys were seeing, demon began to strike that woman who was placed inthe chariot by the dint of his conjuring trick and who was crying ""Rama! Rama!"""
6-81-14,"On seeing her seized by the hair Hanuma the son of wind-god was confounded withaffliction and shed tears, in agony from his eyes."
6-81-15,"On seeing Seetha with all her charming limbs, the beloved wife of Rama, Hanumaangrily addressed the foolowing harsh words to Indrajit:"
6-81-16,"O evil minded one! Born in a dynasty of Brahmanical sages, but belonging todemoniacal race, you touched a lock of her hair, for your hair, for your own ruin."
6-81-17,"O cruel, vulgar and mean fellow! O wicked demon of sinful prowess! O pitilessfellow! Woe be to you, of sinful conduct, in whom such a resolve has taken place. Such an act isworthy of a barbarian. There is no pity in you."
6-81-18,"O pitiless one! Seetha came away from her house, from her kingdom and from herhuband's (Rama's) protection. What wrong has Seetha done to you, that you are killing her?"
6-81-19,"By killing Seetha, you will not survivie for long in any way. O demon, desrving ofdeath! By your act, you indeed fell into my hands."
6-81-20,"Abandoning your life in this world, you shall, after death, descend to those worldswhich are the lot of the killers of women and are condemned even by those who deserved to be killedby the people."
6-81-21,"Thus speaking, Hanuma surrounded as he was by monkeys with their weapons and verymuch enraged, rushed headlong towards Indrajit."
6-81-22,"The army of demons of terrible rage intercepted that army of mokeys possessing ahigh prowess and advancing towards them."
6-81-23,"Stirring up that army of mokeys with a multitude of his arrows, Indrajit replied toHanuma, the foremost of mokeys as follows:"
6-81-24,"For whose sake, Sugreeva, yourself and Rama came here, I am going to kill Seethanow itself, while you stand looking on."
6-81-25,"O monkey! After killing her, I will make a short work of Rama, Lakshmana, yourselftoo, Sugreeva and that vulgar Vibhishana thereafter."
6-81-26,"O monkey! What you have said just now viz. that women are not to be killed, iscorrect. But that which causes tormentation to the enemies indeed needs to be done."
6-81-27,"Having spoken thus to Hanuma, Indrajit personally killed that illusory Seetha, whoahd been sobbing all the while, with his sharp-edged sword."
6-81-28,"Split asunder by him diagonally, that miserable lady of broad hips and pleasant tothe sight, fell down on the ground."
6-81-29,"After killing that woman, Indrajit told Hanuma as follows: ""See, I killed Rama'swife with my weapon. This Seetha is dead and all your labour is in vain."""
6-81-30,"After killing her with a large sword personally, that Indrajit then sitting on hischariot, pleasurefully roared loudly."
6-81-31,"The monkeys standing in vicinity heard his roar, even as he shouted with his mouthwide open, while comfortable sitting in that tower of the aerial chriot, which was actuallydifficult of access for others."
6-81-32,"After killing Seetha in that way, the evil-minded Indrajit became exceedingly glad.Seeing him exceedingly pleased, the monkeys looked dejected and suddenly ran away."
6-82-1,"Hearing that terrific roar, similar to the sound of Indra's thunderbolt, the monkeyslooking hither and thither, ran away in all directions."
6-82-2,"Then, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke (as follows) to all those monkeys, who wererunning away widely apart, looking dejected, miserable and frightened."
6-82-3,"O, monkeys! Why are you running away, looking dejected and leaving your zeal tofight? Where has your valour gone?"
6-82-4,"Come along closely behind me, while I am marching ahead in the battle. For thevaliant who are born in a good family, it is not indeed proper to shrink back from the battle."
6-82-5,"Hearing the words of that wise Hanuma, the monkeys in a cheerful mood, took hold ofmountain-peaks and trees in a great fury."
6-82-6,"The foremost of monkeys, while roaring, rushed towards the demons. They followedhim, by surrounding Hanuma on all sides, in that great battle."
6-82-7,"That Hanuma, being surrounded by those monkey-chiefs on all sides, began to consumethat army of adversaries as a flaming fire."
6-82-8,"That Hanuma, accompanied by his army of monkeys, brought about the destruction ofdemons, as Yama the lord of death does at the time of universal dissolution."
6-82-9,"Filled with inordinate grief and rage, that Hanuma the monkey-chief, threw a largerock on Indrajit's chariot."
6-82-10,"On seeing that rock rushing towards them, the obedient horses, yoked to thatchariot, carried the chariot off to a far-distance."
6-82-11,"That rock employed in vain, without reaching that Indrajit and his charioteersitting in the chariot, split itself into fragments and penetrated the ground."
6-82-12,"The demons were very much bruised by the falling fragments of the rock. That army ofdemons was perturbed over the rock thus falling upon them."
6-82-13,"Hundreds of monkeys with their colossal bodies, lifting up trees and mountain-peaks,rushed roaring towards Indrajit."
6-82-14,"Those monkeys of terrible prowess, threw trees and mountain-peaks towards Indrajitin battle. While shooting a large deluge of trees and rocks, the monkeys caused destruction oftheir enemies. They roared in various high tones."
6-82-15,"Beaten forcibly with trees, by those highly terrible monkeys, those demons offrightful appearance, rolled about restlessly in the battle-field."
6-82-16,"On seeing his army tormented by the monkeys, that enraged Indrajit, taking hold ofhis weapons, sallied forth, facing towards his enemies."
6-82-17,"That Indrajit, of firm fortitude, accompanied by his army, by releasing a multitudeof arrows, killed a very many number of monkeys."
6-82-18,"In the battle, Indrajit's soldiers too killed the monkeys with spikes tips ofmissiles, swords, sharp-edged spears and concealed weapons similar to mallets."
6-82-19,"The mighty Hanuma played a havoc among demons of terrible deeds, with Shala trees,distinguished by excellent trunks and branches as with rocks."
6-82-20,"Keeping the hostile army back, that Hanuma spoke to those monkeys as follows:""Retreat! This army need not be conquered any more by us."""
6-82-21,"That Seetha for whose sake we have fought so far, with a wish to do what ispleasing to Rama, making a special effort to win, risking our lives has been killed."
6-82-22,"Informing Rama and even Sugreeva about this matter, we shall do that which both ofthem are prepared to do in return."
6-82-23,"Thus speaking and keeping back all the monkeys, Hanuma the chief of monkeys, withabsence of fear, along with his army, gradually turned back."
6-82-24,"Seeing Hanuma with drawing to the place where Rama was, the evil-minded Indrajitwent to a sanctuary called Nikumbhila, seeking to pour oblations into the sacred fire."
6-82-25,"Arriving at Nikumbhila, Indrajit poured oblations into the sacred fire. Thereupon,while being propitiated by that demon on reaching sacrificial ground, the sacrificial fire thenblazed up on consuming the oblations of flesh and blood."
6-82-26,"Swollen up when propitiated with oblations of blood, the highly intense fire, likethe evening sun, appeared wrapped in flames."
6-82-27,"Then, Indrajit, well-versed with the technique of performance of rites for theprosperity of the demons, poured oblations according to the scriptural precepts. Seeing this, thosedemons, who knew what was prudent and evil in major battles, stood firm in big piles (by Indrajit'sside)."
6-83-1,"On hearing that great tumult of battle between demons and monkeys, Rama spoke toJambavan as follows:"
6-83-2,"O excellent Jambavan! From the way in which a very great terrible rattling sound ofarms in heard, it seems an exceedingly difficult feat has been performed by Hanuma. It iscertain."
6-83-3,"O lord of bears! Therefore, accompanied by your own army, go and quickly extendyour help to that Hanuma, who is fighting."
6-83-4,"Saying ""Yes, so be it"" and surrounded by his own army, Jambavan came to the westerngate, where the monkey, Hanuma was."
6-83-5,"Thereupon, Jambavan saw Hanuma, coming with monkeys, who had given fight and weresighing (on account of grief caused by the destruction of Seetha)."
6-83-6,"Seeing that terrible army of bears, looking like a dark cloud on their way, ready(to perform battle) and effectively intercepting it, Hanuma retreated them all."
6-83-7,"Quickly seeking the presence of Rama with that army, the highly illustrious Hanuma,with sorrow, spoke the following words to Rama:"
6-83-8,"While we, who were carrying on the battle, stood looking on, Indrajit, the son ofRavana killed Seetha in front of us, even though she continued to weep."
6-83-9,"O destroyer of enemies! On seeing her with my distressed mind, I felt sad. I cameto report the event to you."
6-83-10,"Hearing those words of Hanuma, Rama then was agitated with grief and fell down onthe ground, like a tree with its bottom chopped off."
6-83-11,"On seeing that Rama, who with the semblance of god, falling on the ground, thechiefs of monkeys came bouncing from all sides and rushed towards him."
6-83-12,"They sprinkled him with water, fragrant with scent of lotuses and lilies, as onewould sprinkle an inextinguishable as one would sprinkle an inextinguishable fire, which has justflared up suddenly and is burning all."
6-83-13,"Then, the highly lamenting Lakshmana, having embraced that ailing Rama in his arms,spoke the following meaningful words, endowed with reason:"
6-83-14,"O venerable brother! Virtue cannot save you, who are sticking to the noble path andwho have subdued the senses, from adversities and is (hence) useless."
6-83-15,"Just as inanimate and animate beings are visible, likewise virtue and vice are notvisible. Therefore, my opinion is that virtue is non-existent."
6-83-16,"Even as inanimate beings and animate beings are expressly visible, likewise thisform of virtue of vice is not established. For, in that case, a virtuous man like you would nothave this misfortune."
6-83-17,"If unrighteousness had been effective, Ravana should have obtained the hell. You,endowed with virtue, would never obtain such troubles."
6-83-18,"Since there is absence of calamity for Ravana and misfortune occurred to you, theresult of vice is obtained through virtue and the result of virtue is obtained through vice. Thecontraries of each other have changed the roles with each other."
6-83-19,"Will the fruit of virtue be obtained through virtue and fruit of vice through vice?If that in whom unrighteousness is rooted are enjoined with the fruit of unrighteousness alone,people showing interest in unrighteousness would be deprived of the fruit of virtue. The fruit ofvirtue alone would have accrued to those who administer righteousness through that virtue?"
6-83-20,"Since prosperities of those, in whom unrighteousness is rooted, develop; while thosewho have a conduct of virtue suffer, hence these two (virtue and vice) are useless."
6-83-21,"O Rama! If sinful doers are killed by their own vice, that unrighteousness, as itdoes, in the act of killing, will be forthwith destroyed. Whom will that unrighteousness destroy(which is destroyed in the course of three seconds)?"
6-83-22,"Or if a man is killed by a recourse to a ritual prescribed in the scriptures orkills another (by recourse to such a ritual), that destiny alone, which is engendered by thatritual, is tainted by that sinful act and not the agent."
6-83-23,"O Rama, the destroyer of adversaries! It is not clear how prosperity can be reachedby righteousness, which has never known how to retaliate. Hence, righteousness seems to benon-existent."
6-83-24,"O chief among the virtuous! If righteousness were really there, no evil whateverwould have accrued to you. As you reaped such a calamity, the hypotheses that the destinyengendered by virtuous acts is real is not proved.*"
6-83-25,"Or else, if righteousness becomes weak and cowardly, as it surrenders to the might,it is my opinion that the righteousness, which lacks strength and has been deprived of itscapacity, should no longer be pursued."
6-83-26,"Depend on might, as you do now on virtue, if the virtue is subordinate to might,thus giving up predominance of virtue."
6-83-27,"O tormentator of enemies! Or else, if speaking truth were indeed a virtue, ourlying father, who was merciless to you, was disunited from you. Were you not bound by thatannouncement made by our father regarding your installation as the Prince Regent?"
6-83-28,"O tormentator of your enemies! Had either righteousness or unrighteousness worthpursuing, Indra the wielder of thunderbolt would not have performed a sacrifice on killing a sage(viz. Viswarupa, son of Twasta*)"
6-83-29,"O Rama! Virtue destroys enemies, when united with might (something other thanvirtue). O Rama! A man does all this, according to his will."
6-83-30,"O Rama in a pitiable condition. My opinion is that righteousness consists in suchrecourse to both virtue and strength. The very roots of virtue (in the form of earthly gain) havebeen chopped off by you in that you spurned the sovereignty the other day."
6-83-31,"By the treasures brought from place to place and augmented by means of variousstrategies, all the tasks are indeed fulfilled, as the rivers flow from the mountains."
6-83-32,"All the tasks of a man of small intellect, bereft of his wealth, get a cessation assmall rivers dry up in summer-season."
6-83-33,"Such a man, brought up by comforts, renouncing wealth (within easy reach) andseeking comfort, proceeds to commit sinful act and then evil (in the form of punishment) followsfrom it."
6-83-34,"Friends gather round him, who has riches. Relatives stand by him, who has riches.He alone is virile in the world, who has riches. He alone is a learned man, who has riches."
6-83-35,"He alone is a mighty man, who has riches. He alone is a prudent man, who hasriches. He alone is highly fortunate. He alone is distinguished, who has riches."
6-83-36,"O resolute one! I told you about these evils attendant on the abjuration of wealth.The ground on which you made the resolve to sacrifice the kingdom was not known to me."
6-83-37,"A man in whom the treasures abide, religious merit and wealth are obtained. Allwould be favourable to him. To the penniless man, who has a desire for wealth and even hunting forwealth, it is not possible to attain wealth."
6-83-38,"O king! Delight, sensuous pleasure, pride, virtue, anger, peace, control of thesenses all these are attained from wealth."
6-83-39,"Those riches, due to renunciation of which, worldly happiness of those practicingthe path of virtue gets lost, are not seen in you, any more than the planets are seen in cloudydays."
6-83-40,"O valiant one! While you were in exile, faithful to the command of your father,your wife who was more beloved than life itself, was stolen away by a demon."
6-83-41,"O valiant prince! I shall dispel with my exploits today, that great agony caused byIndrajit. Therefore, rise O Rama!"
6-83-42,"O the foremost among men! O the long-armed one! O the firmly resolute one! Arise!Why are you not knowing about yourself, who is the great-souled and whose spirit isdisciplined?"
6-83-43,"O faultless one! On seeing the death of Seetha and enraged, rising to do favour foryou, I shall completely destroy with my arrows, Lanka with its chariots, elephants and horses alongwith Ravana."
6-84-1,"While Lakshmana, who was so fond of his brother, was consoling Rama, Vibhishana,keeping the troops of simian army in their respective positions, arrived there."
6-84-2,"That Vibhishana, surrounded by four warriors, wielding many types of weapons, andwho were chiefs of troops, looking like heaps of black collyrium and who were appearing likeelephants, approached Lakshmana who was totally engrossed in sorrow and saw the monkeys also, whoseeyes were filled with tears."
6-84-3,"Vibhishana also saw the great-souled Rama, the delight of Inkshvaku dynasty falleninto a swoon and resting on the lap of Lakshmana."
6-84-4,"On seeing the embarrassed Rama, tormented with grief, that Vibhishana, distressed ashe was in spirits, with agony inside, asked him, ""What is this?"""
6-84-5,"Fixing his gaze on Vibhishana's face and looking at Sugreeva and those monkeys,Lakshmana with tears pouring down, spoke the following words, with a splendid meaning:"
6-84-6,"O gentle Sir! Just on hearing through the words of Hanuma, saying that Seetha waskilled by Indrajit, Rama entered into a swoon."
6-84-7,"Intercepting the narrating Lakshmana in the middle, Vibhishana spoke the followingamply meaningful words to Rama, who was in an unconscious state."
6-84-8,"I hold that which you have been told by Hanuma with a sorrowful temper, O ruler ofmen, to be absurd as the drying up of the sea."
6-84-9,"O the long armed! I know the design of the evil-minded Ravana towards Seetha. Hewould never do the killing of Seetha."
6-84-10,"Eventhough begged by me, the well-wisher, several times to give up Seetha, he didnot heed that advice."
6-84-11,"It is neither possible even to see her by recourse to conciliation nor by bestowinggifts nor by sowing dissention. How is it possible then by a war? By any other strategy, it isimpossible."
6-84-12,"That Indrajit for his part retracted, by hoodwinking the monkeys. O the long armed!Know that Seetha (who was seemingly killed by him) as illusory."
6-84-13,"After reaching a sanctuary by name Nikumbhila, this Indrajit will pour oblationsinto the sacred fire. On returning after pouring oblations into the sacred fire, Indrajit willprove difficult to be overcome in battle, even by celestials including Indra."
6-84-14,"Certainly, this conjuring trick (in the form of killing an illusory living effigyof Seetha) was exhibited by him, who was employing his magical art, expecting interruption by theprowess of the monkeys there."
6-84-15,"While the sacrificial performance is not ended, we shall proceed to that place,along with an army. O the foremost of men! Give up this improper grief, which has come upon you.Seeing you tormented with grief, the entire army is sinking into despondency."
6-84-16,"Very exalted as you are in courage, stay you here, confident at heart, and sendLakshmana with us, who are taking an army along with us."
6-84-17,"This Lakshmana, the eminent prince, can make Indrajit abandon that act ofsacrifice, by employing his sharp arrows. Then, he will be susceptible of being killed."
6-84-18,"Lakshmana's arrows, which are sharp and fiery, with a speed equal to the wings of abird, can drink his blood like cruel birds."
6-84-19,"O the long-armed one! Therefore, dispatch Lakshmana having auspicious body-markseven as Indra the lord of celestials employed the thunderbolt to kill Indrajit."
6-84-20,"O the best of men! It is not appropriate to delay the killing of the enemy anyfurther now. Therefore, grant permission to Lakshmana to destroy the enemy, as Indra would hurl histhunderbolt to destroy the enemies of celestials."
6-84-21,"If that Indrajit, the foremost of demons completes the sacrifice, he would not bevisible even to the celestials and the demons in battle. If he come with a desire to fight, afterending that sacrifice, the celestials also will feel a great suspicion on their own lives."
6-85-1,"Hearing those words of Vibhishana, Rama, agonized as he was with grief, could notunderstand clearly what was spoken by that demon."
6-85-2,"Then, Rama the conqueror of the cities of enemies, leaning upon his courage, spoketo Vibhishana who was sitting nearby and in front of the monkeys (as follows):"
6-85-3,"O lord of demons! I wish to hear again those of the words spoken by you. I desireto hear again, whatever you intend to tell me."
6-85-4,"Hearing those words of Rama, spoken very sadly, that Vibhishana who was skilled inexpression, again spoke his words gently as follows:"
6-85-5,"O the long armed hero! Immediately after your orders, the marshalling of the troopswas done by me in the manner as enjoined by you."
6-85-6,"All those armies were divided and positioned at all places. Even the commanders ofthose divisions were arrayed and distributed according to their ranks."
6-85-7,"O great lord! I have to report to you something further. Listen to it. While youare lamenting without any cause, we feel painful at our hearts."
6-85-8,"O king! Abandon this lamentation and false grief which came to you. Let your worry,which augments the pleasure of your adversaries be therefore abandoned."
6-85-9,"O hero! If you want to get back Seetha and if the demons are to be destroyed, raiseup for the occasion. Keep yourself cheerful."
6-85-10,"O Rama! Listen to my benign words I tell you. This Lakshmana together with a largearmy should go soon to kill Indrajit, who reached Nikumbhila, with arrows as deadly as theserpentine poison released from his snake-like bow in battle."
6-85-11,"By his penance, Indrajit obtained a weapon called Brahmashira, by way of a giftfrom Brahma and also horses, which are coursing at his will."
6-85-12,"That Indrajit, as such along with his army, is reported to have reached Nikumbhila.If he comes forth after completing his sacrificial act, know that all of us as killed."
6-85-13,"A boon was given by Brahma to that intelligent demon as follows: O Indrajit! Thatenemy of yours, who strikes while you are marching with your bow drawn, and while you have notarrived at Nikumbhila, or even while you have not offered oblations to the sacred fire, will proveto be the cause of your killing."""
6-85-14,"O mighty Rama! Give your command for killing of Indrajit. When he is killed, knowthat Ravana along with his associate troops also as killed."
6-85-15,"Hearing the words of Indrajit, Rama then spoke the following words:""O Vibhishana oftrue prowess! I know the conjuring trick of that terrific demon."""
6-85-16,"That Indrajit is skilled in the use of the mystic missile presided over by Brahma.He is intelligent. He is a master of several conjuring tricks. He is so mighty that he can renderunconscious in battle even the gods along with Varuna the king of gods."
6-85-17,"O highly illustrious hero! While he drifts in the sky, ascending his chariot, hismovement is not known to others, as the sun is not seen beneath a dense mass of clouds."
6-85-18,"Having known the toughness of the conjuring tricks of the evil-minded adversary,Rama spoke to the illustrious Lakshmana as follows:"
6-85-19,"O Lakshmana! You, accompanied by that entire army which stands at the disposal ofSugreeva, along with troop-commanders with Hanuma as their head; and protected by Jambavan the lordof bears, who will be accompanied by his army, kill that Indrajit the prince of demons, rich in thepower of conjuring tricks."
6-85-20,"The great souled Vibhishana, who knows all the conjuring tricks of Indrajit, alongwith his counsellors, will follow behind you."
6-85-21,"Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana of highly wonderful prowess, along withVibhishana, took hold of his excellent bow."
6-85-22,"The rejoiced Lakshmana who was prepared for the combat, clad in an armour, wieldinga sword and arrows, wearing his bow in his left hand and having touched Rama's feet in salutation,spoke as follows:"
6-85-23,"Today, the arrows released from my bow, piercing Indrajit, will drop into the Cityof Lanka, as swans descend into a louts-pond."
6-85-24,"Now itself, my arrows discharged from the bow-string of this great bow, dulysplitting his terrific body, will blow him away."
6-85-25,"Thus speaking in front of his brother, that resplendent Lakshmana, quickly marchedforward, with an intent to kill Indrajit."
6-85-26,"Offering salutation to the feet of his brother and doing circumambulation too, thatLakshmana went to the sanctuary named Nikumbhila, which was protected by Indrajit."
6-85-27,"Having obtained the blessings from his brother, the glorious Lakshmana, the prince,quickly sallied forth along with Vibhishana."
6-85-28,"Then, Hanuma accompanied by many a thousand of monkeys and Vibhishana along with hiscounsellors went behind Lakshmana."
6-85-29,"That Lakshmana, quickly surrounded by a large army of monkeys, saw the army ofJambavan also stationed in the way."
6-85-30,"After covering a long distance, that Lakshmana, the delight to his friends, saw thearmy of Ravana, ranged in battle-array, from a distance."
6-85-31,"Duly arriving at Nikumbhila, that foe-conquering Lakshmana stood, bow in hand, toconquer that Indrajit, the possessor of conjuring tricks, in conformity with Brahma'sordinance."
6-85-32,"The valiant Lakshmana stood there along with Vibhishana, the heroic Angada andHanuma, the son of wind-god."
6-85-33,"Lakshmana penetrated that heterogeneous army of enemies, resplendent with spotlessweapons, thick with ensigns and abounded with huge chariots, exceedingly impenetrable, veryterrific, with unimaginable swiftness, even as one would enter a thick veil of darkness."
6-86-1,"In that situation, Vibhishana then spoke the following words, which were hostile tothe enemies and advantageous to Lakshmana."
6-86-2,"Let this army of demons which is seen here, dark as a cloud, be quickly engaged inbattle, by the monkeys using rocks as thier weapons."
6-86-3,"O Lakshmana! Make an effort to break this mighty army. When this army is destroyed,Indrajit also will become visible."
6-86-4,"You as such, rush forward quickly, gushing out arrows, equal to Indra'sthunderbolt, on the enemies, so long as this sacrificial act of Indrajit is not actually carriedthrough."
6-86-5,"O hero! Make a short work of Indrajit, the evil minded, who is interested inperforming conjuring tricks, who is unjust, engaged in cruel acts and who brings fear to all theworlds."
6-86-6,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Lakshmana, having auspicious marks, showered forthstreams of arrows in the direction of Indrajit."
6-86-7,"Bears and monkeys, who fight was gigantic trees, rushed towards that army of demons,drawn up in battle-array."
6-86-8,"The demons too, with an intent to kill the monkeys in battle, attacked them withsharp arrows, sowrds, spears and javelins."
6-86-9,"That tumultuous battle between the monkeys and the demons rendered Lanka noisy onall sides with its great uproar."
6-86-10,"The sky was covered with weapons of various shapes, sharp arrows, trees and tossedmountain tops."
6-86-11,"Those demons of ugly faces and arms, hurling weapons on the monkeys, created a greatfear."
6-86-12,"Even the monkeys too struck and killed all the demons in the battle, with varioustypes of trees and mountain-peaks."
6-86-13,"A great fear developed among the demons who were fighting with mighty leaders ofbears and monkeys endowed with colossal bodies."
6-86-14,"Hearing that his own army being tormented by the enemies, was dejected; thatunconquerable Indrajit left off, without performing the sacrificial rite."
6-86-15,"That enraged Indrajit, coming out from the gloominess of the trees, ascended hisfirmly yoked chariot which had already been united"
6-86-16,"That awful Indrajit, armed with terrific bow and arrows, looking like a mass ofblack collyrium with his blood-red eyes, appeared like the destructive Death."
6-86-17,"Just on seeing Indrajit being on a chariot, that army of demons with a terrificspeed, turned back, wishing to fight with Lakshmana."
6-86-18,"At that time, Hanuma the destroyer of enemies looking like a mountain, uplifted anabsolutely unpaalleled large tree. Consuming that army of demons, as a fire at the time ofuniversal dissolution, the aforesaid monkey made that army unconscious on the battle field, withmany trees."
6-86-19,"Immediately on seeing Hanuma destroying thier army rapidly, thousands of demonshurled weapons on him."
6-86-20,"Approaching Hanuma looking like a mountain, the demons bearing pointed pikes struckhim from all sides with pkes, those carrying swords in their hands with swords, those carringjavelins in their hands with jalins, with iron rods with maces; those armed with sharp-edged spearswith spears, as also with bright-looking spears, with hundreds of cylindrical wooden pieces studdedwith iron spikes, with steel hammers, ,with awful axes, with slings for the rwing stones, withtheir thunderbolt-like fists and slaps which fell like flashes of lighning. Then, the enragedHanuma made a colossal destruction of those demons."
6-86-21,"That Indrajit saw Hanuma, the foremost of monkeys, looking like a mountain,fearlessly killing his enemies."
6-86-22,"He spoke the following words tohis charioteer: ""Take the chariot to the place wherethat monkey is standing. If we neglect him, he will surely destroy our demons."""
6-86-23,"Hearing the words of that Indrajit, the charioteer went, carrying that veryunconquerable Indrajit sitting in the chariot, to the place where Hanuma was there."
6-86-24,"Coming close to Hanuma, that unconquerable Indrajit hurled swords, sharp-edgedspears and axes on the head of Hanuma."
6-86-25,"Receiving those terrible weapons, that Hanuma spoke, seized as he was, with greatrage, the following words:"
6-86-26,"O evil-minded Indrajit! If you are valiant, fight with me. Coming nearer to Hanuma,you will not return alive."
6-86-27,"O foolish fellow! If you enter into a duel with me, fight with your arms. Withstandmy force in the battle-field. Then you will be considered as the best among the demons."
6-86-28,"Vibhishana told Lakshmana in the following words that while with bow upraised,Indrajit sought to kill Hanuma."
6-86-29,"Having seated in a chariot, Indrajit, who conquered Indra, is seeking to killHanuma."
6-86-30,"O Lakshmana! Kill that Indrajit with your terrific arrows of incomparableworkmanship, which ward off the enemies and putting an end to their lives."
6-86-31,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, who was fearful to his adversaries, thegreat-souled Lakshmana saw Indrajit, who closely resembled a mountain, seated in a chariot, ofterrific strength and who was difficult to approach."
6-87-1,"After speaking to him as aforesaid, Vibhishana taking Lakshmana, who held a bow inhis hand, felt rejoiced and hastened away."
6-87-2,"Moving not very distant from there and entering an extensive thicket, Vibhishanashowed to Lakshmana, the place where Indrajit was going to pour oblations into the sacred fire."
6-87-3,"The glorious Vibhishana showed a terribly looking banyan tree, appearing like ablace cloud (and spoke as follows)."
6-87-4,"After offering oblations to the spirits at this place, the mighty Indrajit proceedsto the battle afterwards."
6-87-5,"Thereupon, this demon becomes invisible to any one, kills some enemies in battleand binds some with his excellent arrows."
6-87-6,"Destroy that mighty Indrajit, along with his chariot, horses and charioteer, byreleasing your blazing arrows, even while he has not reached the banyan tree."
6-87-7,"That greatly brilliant Lakshmana, a delight of his fiends, saying 'So be it' tookhis stand there, twanging his bow at full length."
6-87-8,"That Indrajit, the son of Ravana, clad in armour, armed with a sword, anddistinguished by his ensign, appeared in a fire-coloured chariot."
6-87-9,"That highly splendid Lakshmana spoke to that Indrajit, the scion of Sage Paulastya,who had never been conquered before (as follows); ""I am inviting you for a fight. Give battle to mein a right manner."""
6-87-10,"Thus spoken by Lakshmana, Indrajit with a great brilliance and high mindedness,seeing Vibhishana there, spoke the following harsh words to him:"
6-87-11,"O demon! You are born and brought up here. You are a direct brother to my fatherand a paternal uncle to me. How can you be hostile to a son?"
6-87-12,"O perverted fellow, an abuser of righteousness! Consanguinity is not a norm foryou, nor friendliness, nor pride of birth, nor a brotherly feeling nor a right conduct."
6-87-13,"O evil-minded one! You are pitiable and deserve to be reproached by the virtuous,in that having abandoned your onw kind, you have entered into the service of our enemy."
6-87-14,"You are not recognizing the great difference because of your feeble mind. Where isliving together with one's own kindred and where is taking refuge with low kind of enemies?"
6-87-15,"Opponents may be virtuous. One's own kindred may not be virtuous. But, a relation,though bereft of merit is preferable. An enemy is, indeed, ever an enemy."
6-87-16,"He who, abandoning his own side, takes sides with adversary, is killed, after hisown knsmen are destroyed just by those people of the other side."
6-87-17,"O Indrajit, the demon! The ruthlessness thus shown by you and the manlinessexhibited by you (in bringing Lakshmana here) could be possible only by you, our own kindred."
6-87-18,"Hearing the words of Indrajit, his brother's son, Vibhishana replied: ""O demon! Whydo you speak perversely, as though you are not aware of my nature."""
6-87-19,"O Indrajit the wicked one! Atleast out of respect for the elders, abandon yourharshness. Even if I am born in a demoniac race, which does cruel acts, my nature is goodness,which is prime virtue of human beings and it is not demoniacal."
6-87-20,"I neither delight in cruel acts, nor rejoice in unvirtuous acts. How can a brotherbe driven away by his brother, even if the former's nature is different?"
6-87-21,"Renouncing a man of sinful resolve hose conduct has deviated from righteousness,one attains happiness, as one shakes off a venomous serpent from his hand."
6-87-22,"The wise men say that an evil-natured fellow, who is intent on taking away other'sproperty and lustfully touches another's wife, is worth shunning, as one abandons a house inflames."
6-87-23,"Three faults produce destruction. Taking away other's property, lustfully touchinganother's wife and excessive distrust with one's friends."
6-87-24,"These faults which destroy one's life and lordship killing great sages terribly,waging war against all celestials, arrogance, becoming angry very easily, quarrelsomeness, ill-willhave concealed the good qualities of my elder brother, as the clouds conceal the view ofmountains."
6-87-25,"Because of these vices, Ravana, your father and my brother, has been abandoned byme. Neither will this City of Lanka will exist any longer nor you nor your father."
6-87-26,"O demon! You can talk to me as you like, since you are arrogant, foolish,indisciplined and caught, as you are, in the noose of Death."
6-87-27,"O the worst of demons! You got this calamity here because you spoke harsh words tome today. You cannot reach the banyan-tree any longer."
6-87-28,"It is not possible for you to survive, on attacking Lakshmana. You fight withLakshmana, the lord of men, in the battle-field. After being killed, you will do sacred work in theabode of Yama, the god of Death."
6-87-29,"Do spend away all your weapons and arrows, by showing your own augmented strength.Reaching the range of Lakshmana's arrows, you will not indeed return alive with your armytoday."
6-88-1,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Indrajit was excited with rage, spoke harsh wordsand rushed forward in fury."
6-88-2,"Indrajit was looking like Yama the lord of Death at the time of dissolution of theworld, sitting in a well-decorated and distinguished chariot yoked with black horses, havingupraised sword and weapons, raising a big terrific enormous strong and swift bow and laying hold ofarrows which can torment the enemies."
6-88-3,"The mighty the destroyer of adversaries, wielding a large bow, fully adorned, andseated in a chariot saw that Lakshmana who was embellished with his own splendor."
6-88-4,"Indrajit hurriedly spoke to those foremost of monkeys and to this Lakshmana, whoascended Hanuma's back with a splendor of the sun shining on Mount Udaya and also with Vibhishanaas follows: ""You behold my prowess now."""
6-88-5,"Now, you can face an unconquerable stream of arrows, like rain, released in thesky, as discharged from my bow in the battle-field."
6-88-6,"Today my arrows released from my large bow will destroy your bodies, as fireconsumes a pile of cotton."
6-88-7,"Today, I will send all of you to the world of Yama the lord of Death, by piercingyou with my sharp arrows and hurling the pikes, javelins and lances on you."
6-88-8,"Who can stand before me, while I release streams of arrows with my swift-hand inbattle, thundering like a cloud?"
6-88-9,"Earlier on that day, in a nocturnal battle, both of you along with Sugreeva andother followers, were made unconscious by my arrows which were like thunderbolts and tips ofmissiles as also you were made to fall down on the floor."
6-88-10,"Do you not have that remembrance? I presume clearly that you are on the road toYama the lord of Death, since you have come to give battle to me, enraged as I am, like a venomousserpent."
6-88-11,"Enraged in hearing that roaring of Indrajit, Lakshmana then spoke the followingwords, with a courageous countenance."
6-88-12,"O demon! It has been proclaimed by you about the successful conclusion of yourtasks, eventhough it is difficult to achieve them. He alone is clever, whoever carries through hisundertakings in practice."
6-88-13,"O evil-minded one! You are thinking that you have accomplished your end, byproclaiming through word alone, the achievement of your end, which is difficult to attain foranyone, though you, as such, lack in capacity to achieve your purpose."
6-88-14,"The path, which was followed on that day by you, becoming invisible in thebattle-field, is the one trodden by thieves and is not the path followed by valiant ones."
6-88-15,"O demon! Having reached the range of your arrows, I am standing before you.Therefore show your prowess today. Why should you brag with your words?"
6-88-16,"Hearing those words, the mighty Indrajit, victorious in battle, reaching histerrific bow, released sharp arrows from it."
6-88-17,"Duly reaching Lakshmana, the arrows released by Indrajit, which rushed with greatspeed and were as deadly as the venom of serpents, fell like the hissing of snakes."
6-88-18,"The swift Indrajit, the son of Ravana, with his arrows of very great velocity, inthat battle, struck Lakshmana who was endowed with auspicious body-marks."
6-88-19,"That glorious Lakshmana, drenched in blood, with his body very much wounded byarrows, shone like a smokeless flame."
6-88-20,"Mulling over his own feat, Indrajit for his part, approaching Lakshmana and emittingan exceedingly loud roar, spoke the following words:"
6-88-21,"The sharp-edged and deadly arrows, with their wings, released from my bow, will nowtake your life, O Lakshmana!"
6-88-22,"O Lakshmana! Let a number of Jackals, multitude of hawks and vultures descend uponyou, when struck down by me, you are dead."
6-88-23,"The exceedingly evil-minded Rama now itself can see you, a mere kshatriya (militaryclass only for a name sake), ever ignoble and his devoted brother, killed by me."
6-88-24,"O Lakshmana! Rama will see you, struck down by me today, with your armour droppeddown, bow thrown about and head dismantled."
6-88-25,"Lakshmana, understanding the sense of the word, replied in the following logicalwords to the enraged Indrajit thus speaking harshly."
6-88-26,"O evil-minded one! Give up strength of speech in your empty words. O demons! Youare doing cruel acts. Why do you indulge in such idle talk? Make it active with your goodwork."
6-88-27,"O demon! Without performing that act, why do you boast yourself here? Perform thatact by which I can believe your brag."
6-88-28,"O the worst of persons! Without speaking even a few harsh words, without abusingyou and without bragging myself, Lo! I will kill you."
6-88-29,"Thus speaking, Lakshmana stretching five steel arrows upto the ear, dug them intothe demon's chest with a great speed."
6-88-30,"The arrows, blazing like serpents and feathered with fine plumes, shone likesun-rays in that demon's chest."
6-88-31,"Struck with arrows by Lakshmana, that enraged Indrajit pierced in return threearrows well-directed towards Lakshmana."
6-88-32,"That fight between Lakshmana, the foremost among men and Indrajit, the formost amongdemons, who wished to conquer one over the other in battle, was most terrific and tumultuous."
6-88-33,"Both were endowed with strength. Both were distinguished for their prowess. Bothwere exceedingly difficult to conquer and peerless in strength and courage."
6-88-34,"Those two heroes, who were difficult to overcome in battle, fought at that momentlike two plants figuring in the sky and like Indra and Vritra, the demon."
6-88-35,"Then, the two warriors, who were engaged in releasing several streams of arrows,fought like two lions. Lakshmana the foremost among humans and Indrajit the foremost among demonsfought with rejoice."
6-88-36,"Thereupon, Lakshmana the tormentator of enemies, fitting his arrows to his bow,released arrows on Indrajit, hissing like an enraged serpent."
6-88-37,"Hearing the twang of the bow-string of Lakshmana, Indrajit the Chief of demonsbecame pale-faced and fixed his gaze on Lakshmana."
6-88-38,"Seeing Indrajit (the son of Ravana) pale-faced, Vibhishana spoke as follows toLakshmana, who was fully absorbed in the fight."
6-88-39,"O the long-armed Lakshmana! I infer on the strength of the indications which I seein Indrajit, that he is disappointed. There is no doubt about it. Make haste."

6-88-45,"At first, both of you along with your foremost warriors in a major encounter, wereindeed laid down unconscious on the ground, by my arrows which were equal to Indra'sthunderbolt."
6-88-46,"The fact that you desire to attack me means that either the remembrance of it nolonger exists in you or I presume you desire to go clearly to the abode of Yama the lord ofDeath."

6-88-51,"O demon! Heroes who come to battle do not strike like this. These arrows of yoursare light, weak and mild indeed."
6-88-52,"Warriors, who wish to win in battle, do not fight like this. Thus speaking,Lakshmana the wielder of a bow, streamed forth arrows on him."

6-90-64,"Fitting a missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials, which had neverbeen defeated in battle, to his excellent bow and drawing it, the glorious Lakshmana addressed thefollowing prayer, which was intended to achieve his purpose:"
6-90-65,"O my dear arrow! If Rama the son of Dasaratha has set his mind on virtue, keeps uphis promise and is second to none in his prowess, destroy this Indrajit."

6-91-8,"Smelling the head of that Lakshmana, who had augmented his fame and yet who wasfeeling abashed (to hear himself being praised), forcibly drawing him to his lap and placing thatLakshmana his younger brother in his lap with affection, wounded as he was, that valiant Rama,having embraced him, tenderly gazed upon him affectionately again and again."
6-91-9,"Smelling once more the head of that Lakshmana, who was feeling tormented by thearrows that had penetrted into his body, who had been wounded, who was breathing heard, who wasendowed with auspicious characterestics, was afflicted with agony and was feeling paine dat thetime of respiration, and hurriedly stroking him as well as restoring confidence in him, Rama theforemost among men spoke the following words:"
6-91-10,"An extremely noble act was performed by you, a doer of difficult things. Now, thathis son having been killed, I account Ravana to have been killed in battle."
6-91-11,"As that evil-minded enenmy has been killed, I become victorious. O valiantLakshmana! Fortunately, you indeed severed the right hand of the cruel Ravana. Indrajit is indeedthe support for that Ravana. Vibhishana and Hanuma too performed a great feat in the greatbattle."
6-91-12,"In the course of three days and nights, the valiant Indrajit was felled downsomehow. Now, I have been made free of enemies. Hearing of his son having been struck down, Ravanawill indeed come forth with a great and powerful battle-array."
6-91-13,"By encircling that Ravana, who is difficult to be conquered, with a great army, Iwill kill him, who is coming forth with a feeling of distress for the death of his son."
6-91-14,"O Lakshmana! As that Indrajit has been killed in battle by you, who are myprotector, neither Seetha nor this entire earth is hard to attain."
6-91-15,"Having thus consoled Lakshmana and having embraced him, that Rama who was born inRaghu-dynansty, was duly delighted and by calling Sushena, spoke to him the following words:"
6-91-16,"O highly intelligent one! You attend upon this wounded Lakshmana, who is fond offrinds, so that he will become perfectly well in health."
6-91-17,"Let Lakshmana along with Vibhishana be quickly made free from pain caused by thearrows that have penetrated into their body. Let all others too among the gallant bear andmonkey-warriors fighting with trees who have fought on the battle-field here and stand pierced witharrows and owunded, be healed in the same way with great care."""
6-91-18,"As commanded by Rama, the great-souled Sushena, the monkey-cheif gave an excellentmedicine through nose to Lakshmana."
6-91-19,"Inhaling the odour of that herb, Lakshmana became healed of the arrow-wounds, freefrom pains and his wounds got completely cured."
6-91-20,"As per the order of Rama, Sushena then treated his companions like Vibhishana andothers including all the monkey-chiefs."
6-91-21,"Then, with his arrow-wounds healed, his fatigue gone and his feverishness curedwithin a moment, Lakshmana having restored his original disposition, felt joyful there."
6-91-22,"Then, on seeing Lakshmana standing up with sound health, Rama, Sugreeva, Vibhishanaand the valiant Jambavan along with the army were rejoiced for a long time."
6-91-23,"That great-souled Rama apllauded the ardous feat of Lakshmana. Hearing of Indrajithaving been kille din battle, Sugreeva became delighted."
6-92-1,"Hearing of Indrajit's killing and having ascertained the news, Ravana's counsellorsreported the matter hurriedly to Ravana."
6-92-2,"O monarch! Your great majestic son has been killed by Lakshmana with the help ofVibhishana, while we were witnessing the event in the battle-field."
6-92-3,"Your valiant son, who was unbeatable in combats and that hero who conquered Indrathe lord of celestials, having collided with valiant Lakshmana, has been killed. Having tormentedLakshmana with his arrows, Indrajit departed to the highest world."
6-92-4,"Hearing that news of formidable, harsh and terrific death of Indrajit his son inbattle, Ravana gave way to a protracted swoon."
6-92-5,"Regaining his consciousness after a long time, the king Ravana, confounded as he waswith sorrow on account of his son's death and with his mind confused, lamented as follows depressedas he was."
6-92-6,"Alas! My child, the chief of the army of demons, having extraordinary might! Havingconquered Indra, how have you been subjected to the power of Lakshmana now?"
6-92-7,"Certainly, when enraged, you would pierce with your arrows in battle, even theall-destroying time in the form of Yama the Lord of Death and even the peaks of Mount Mandara. Whatto tell about Lakshmana?"
6-92-8,"O the long armed one! Highly esteemed to me is the king Yama, son of sun-god, bywhom you have been subjected to the ravages of time today."
6-92-9,"This is the path for great warriors even among all the celestial hosts. That maleoffspring who is killed for the cause of his lord, obtains heaven."
6-92-10,"Seeing Indrajit having been killed, all the hosts of celestials, the guardians ofthe world and the great sages now can sleep comfortably and peacefully."
6-92-11,"Bereft of Indrajit alone, the entire earth with its forest appear to be whollyalone to me. Nay, even the three worlds!"
6-92-12,"Now, I shall hear the hue and cry of the demon-maidens in the gynaecium, even asone would hear the roar of a troop of female-elephants in a mountain cave."
6-92-13,"O destroyer of enemies! Where did you go leaving the rank of Prince Regent as alsoLanka, the demons, your mother and myself, your wives and all of us."
6-92-14,"O hero! The obsequies rights in my honour ought to have been done by you,consequent upon my death in future. You are, however, following a reverse path."
6-92-15,"Deserting us without taking away my tormentation, while Sugreeva, lakshmana andRama are still alive, where have you gone?"
6-92-16,"A huge rage enveloped Ravana, the king of demons, born of his son's death, while hewas feeling distressed through grief as aforesaid."
6-92-17,"The anguishes occasioned by the death of his son, flared up further for him, who byhis very nature, was wrathful, as rays of the sun flare up the blazing sun in summer."
6-92-18,"With his eye brows joined together on his forehead, he shone brightly like an ocean,at the time of the dissolution of the world, with crocodiles and giant waves."
6-92-19,"While he was yawning with anger; a fire with smoke, as though clearly burning, brokeout from his mouth, as it did from the month of Vritra (in the former days)."
6-92-20,"Afflicted with the grief of his son's killing, that valiant Ravana got wrapped up inwrath and pondering with his mind, craved for the killing of Seetha."
6-92-21,"The dreadful eyes of that Ravana, which were red in colour by their very nature andwere red even by the fire of his wrath, looked glittering."
6-92-22,"That naturally terrific form of Ravana, filled with the fire of his wrath, becamedifficult to be approached, like the form of enraged Rudra the god of destruction."
6-92-23,"Drops of tears fell down from his enraged eyes, as drops of oil with flames falldown from blazing lamps."
6-92-24,"The sound of his teeth, produced from the friction of his teeth as he ground them,were heard like the noise of a large machine being bragged by the demons."
6-92-25,"Trembling with fear, the demons hid themselves, in whichever quarter to which hedirected his look, enraged as he was, like the fire of universal dissolution."
6-92-26,"Demons could not go towards Ravana, who was looking at all the four quarters, likethe enraged Yama the god of Death, who wants to devour both the mobile and the immobilecreatures."
6-92-27,"Desirous of posting the demons to the battle-field, Ravana the king of demons, whowas very much enraged, then spoke as follows, in their midst:"
6-92-28,"Brahma the lord of creation was gratified by me, by performing a stupendousausterity for thousands of years, at the conclusion of those austerities."
6-92-29,"As a consequence of that austerity alone and by the grace of Brahma the lord ofcreation, there was never a fear for me either from the demons or from the celestials."
6-92-30,"In the course of combats with the gods and demons, the armour gifted to me byBrahma, the lord of creation, which is as brilliant as the sun, could not be mutilated by those whoheld the thunderbolt in their fists."
6-92-31,"Who will, be it Indra himself, dare to attack me on the battle-field now, whenmounted on chariot on this field of battle, and duly wearing the aforesaid armour?"
6-92-32,"Let that large bow of mine, which was given at that time to me along with arrows bythe gracious Brahma the lord of creation, on the occasion of my combat between gods and demons, betaken out today to the accompaniment of a band of musical instruments, for the purpose of killingRama and Lakshmana in the great battle."
6-92-33,"That cruel Ravana, afflicted as he was with grief at the killing of his son, wassubjected to anger and deeply pondering with his mind, decided kill Seetha."
6-92-34,"Looking fixedly with blood-red eyes on all those demons, who were making miserablesounds, that very awful Ravana for his part, who had assumed a terrible appearance, though feelingdistressed, spoke to them as follows:"
6-92-35,"In order to hoodwink the monkeys, something which had been killed there, was shown,by taking recourse to conjuring tricks, as Seetha, by my child (Indrajit)"
6-92-36,"I shall make that hoax into a hard reality, which is pleasing to me. I shalldestroy Seetha, who is devoted to Rama, a bad warrior. Thus speaking to his counsellors, heswiftly drew his sword."
6-92-37,"The enraged Ravana, who was very much agitated in mind because of the grief for hisson's death, springing up suddenly and taking his excellent sword, having the dazzle of a clearsky, sallied forth from the assembly hall along with his ministers swiftly and quickly to the placewhere Seetha was."
6-92-38,"Seeing Ravana going, his followers emitted a lion's roar. Seeing the enraged Ravanaand embracing each other, they spoke as follows:"
6-92-39,"Both those brothers (Rama and Lakshmana), on seeing him now in fury, will getperturbed. Indeed even the four guardians of the world had been frightened by him, who was in fury.Many other enemies were also frightened by him in various battles."
6-92-40,"Fetching precious things existing in all the three worlds, Ravana enjoys them. Noone on the earth is equal to him in strength and prowess."
6-92-41,"While those demons were thus talking, Ravana who was excited with fury, rushedtowards Seetha, who was present in the Ashoka grove."
6-92-42,"Though being kept back by his companions whose minds were set on his welfare, Ravanawho was very much enraged, rushed like Mars, in the sky, which would rush towards theconstellation, Rohini in fury."
6-92-43,"The faultless Seetha for her part, who was being guarded by female demons, saw theenraged Ravana who was bearing an excellent sword."
6-92-44,"Seetha was perturbed in seeing him, bearing sword and who was not going backeventhough being kept back in many ways by his friends."
6-92-45,"Filled with sorrow and lamenting, Seetha said to herself as follows: ""From themanner in which this fellow himself is rushing towards me in fury, I fear the evil-minded demon isgoing to kill me, to make me husband-less, even though I have a husband""."
6-92-46,"He incited me several times, devoted as I am to my husband, saying 'Be myconsort!'. He was refused firmly by me. Having been evidently afflicted with despair on my refusingto wait upon him, he is surely intent to kill me, filled as he was with anger and infatuation."
6-92-47,"Otherwise, that vulgar demon might have killed those brothers, Rama and Lakshmana,the foremost of men, today in battle, because of me."
6-92-48,"Here, I just heard a terrific great noise of a multitude of demons, who have beenjubilant and roaring about a pleasant happening."
6-92-49,"Alas! Woe is me, if that destruction of the two princes was brought about becauseof me. Otherwise, the terrific demon of a sinful resolve, having not been able to kill Rama andLakshmana, is going to kill, me, because of the grief over his son's death."
6-92-50,"Those words of Hanuma were not acted upon by me, having a low mind. If I left onthat day on his back, though not won back by my husband, I would not have grieved like this today,as I should be resting on the lap of my husband (in that case)."
6-92-51,"I think that the heart of that Kausalya will get burst, when the lady, who had onlyone son, hears of her son having been killed in battle."
6-92-52,"While lamenting, Kausalya will vividly recall about the birth, childhood, youth,the righteous acts and the handsome form of the great-souled Rama."
6-92-53,"Having observed a ceremony in honour of her deceased son and getting despondent andunconscious, Kausalya will surely enter the flame or be drowned in water."
6-92-54,"Woe be to the unfaithful hunch-back Manthara, of sinful resolve, on whoseconsequence, Kausalya will get this grief."
6-92-55,"Seeing Seetha miserably weeping in that manner like Rohini (the deity presiding overa constellation of this name), fallen under the sway of the planet Mars, when away of the moon-god(her husband), a minister called Suparshva, a good-natured, upright and highly intelligent demon,even though restrained by other ministers, spoke the following words Ravana, the foremost ofdemons:"
6-92-56,"O Ravana, the younger brother of Kubera himself! How do you wish to kill Seetha,abandoning your righteousness, in a bout of anger?"
6-92-57,"O valiant king of demons! Why are you thinking of destroying a lady, ever since youcompleted the vow of celibacy essential for a study of the Vedic lore and were devoted to your ownduty?"
6-92-58,"O king! Behold at Seetha, endowed, as she is, with beauty. Together with us,release your anger, in battle, on Rama alone."
6-92-59,"Making yourself ready today itself, the fourteenth day of the dark half of thismonth, you along with the armies, sally forth tomorrow, the moonless day, to victory."
6-92-60,"As a valiant and shrewd chariot-warrior, fighting with a sword, in the foremost ofyour chariots, you can fetch Seetha by killing Rama, the son of Dasaratha."
6-92-61,"Accepting that advice, endowed with justice, tendered by a friend, the evil-mindedRavana went to his palace. Thereafter, that valiant Ravana, along with his friends, again went tohis assembly hall from there."
6-93-1,"That king, who was dejected and very much distressed, having entered thessembly-hall, sat on his pre-eminent seat, snorting like a lion."
6-93-2,"That mighty Ravana, who was emaciated for his son's death, having joined both hispalms in salutation, spoke the following words all those chiefs of army:"
6-93-3,"Surrounded by the entire elephants and horses, as also graced with columns ofchariots and foot-soldiers, all of you march forward."
6-93-4,"Encircling Rama alone, you have to kill him, by showering streams of arrows uponhim, even as clouds pour showers during the rainy season."
6-93-5,"Or I shall kill Rama, while the world is witnessing it tomorrow, once his limbs aretorn by you with your sharp arrows in the great battle."
6-93-6,"Having heard those words of Ravana, those demons sallied forth for the battle, alongwith various kinds of armies and speedy chariots."
6-93-7,"All those demons hurled iron clubs, sharp-edged spikes, arrows, swords and axescapable of destroying the life. The monkeys too hurled trees and mountains towards the demons."
6-93-8,"Towards sun-rise, that very terrific battle became tumultuous between demons andmonkeys."
6-93-9,"Those monkeys and demons then began to strike each other with multi-coloured maces,darts, swords and axes in the battle."
6-93-10,"While the battle was thus in progress, the surprisingly enormous dust was actuallysettled down by the streams of blood, proceeding from the demons and mokeys."
6-93-11,"With elephants and chariots as their river-banks, with horses as their fish and withflag-staffs as trees, rivers of blood gushed forth, carrying dead"
6-93-12,"Then, all those monkeys were drenched in streams of blood. Leaping and bouncing onthe battle-field, the monkey-chiefs broke off flag-staffs, armours, chariots, horses and variouskinds of weapons."
6-93-13,"With their sharp teeth and nails, the monkeys tore off the hair, ears, eye-brows andnoses of the demons."
6-93-14,"A hundred monkey-chiefs rushed towards each single demon in the battle, even asbirds would rush towards a tree laden with fruits."
6-93-15,"Then, the demons resembling mountain in size, struck down the terrific monkeys withlarge maces, darts, swords and axes."
6-93-16,"The huge army of monkeys, being struck down by the demons, sought refuge in Rama,the son of Dasaratha, who affords protection."
6-93-17,"Thereupon, Rama of great splendour and prowess, taking up his bow and entering thearmy of demons, streamed forth showers of arrows."
6-93-18,"Those highly terrific demons dared not approach Rama, having entered their ranks,was scorching them with the flame of his arrows, even as clouds would not approach the scorchingsun in the sky."
6-93-19,"Those demons saw the most terrible deeds only of Rama, when they were actuallyperformed by him in the battle-field, which were difficult to perform for others."
6-93-20,"Those demons could not actually see Rama, whle he was shaking their huge army andblowing away their great chariots, any more than one could see a gale of wind in a forest."
6-93-21,"They saw the army torn and pierced with arrows, as also scorched, broken down andtormented with missiles. They could not see Rama, who was so swift in his martial art."
6-93-22,"The demons could not behold Rama hitting their bodies, even as created beings arenot able to see their individual souls resting in their sense-objects."
6-93-23,"Here is Rama, killing the army of elephants. Here is Rama, destroying greatchariot-warriors. Here is Rama, killing foot-soldiers along with horses with his sharp arrows.Saying so, all those demons struck one another with rage in the battle-field those who were insimilarity of appearance to Rama."
6-93-24,"Having been thrown into confusion by the great mystic missile presided over by theGandharvas, the celestial musicians; presided over by the Gandharvas, the celestial musicians;those demons were unable to see Rama, even when he was scorching away their army."
6-93-25,"Those demons for their part saw thousands of Rama's in the battle-field, while atother times, they saw only one Rama in that great battle."
6-93-26,"Those demons for their part saw thousands of Ramas in the battle-field; while atother times, they saw only one Rama in that great battle."
6-93-27,"The created beings saw that Rama in the form of a discus, which was killing thedemons on the battle-field, like the ""Wheel of Time"", for its flame, the arrows for its spokes, hisbow for the felly of the wheel, the twanging of the bow-string and the clanging of the gauntlet forthe sound produced for its revolution, his energy and the virtues for its radiance and the power ofhis mystic missiles for its edge."
6-93-28,"Within a matter of three hours, with his arrows looking like tongues of flames, Ramakilled an army of demons, capable of changing their form at will, including ten thousands chariotspossessing the swiftness of the wind, eighteen thousand strong elephants, fourteen thousand horseswith their riders and a full two lacs of demons fighting on foot."
6-93-29,"Those surviving demons, with their horses killed, with their chariots destroyed,with thier flag-staffs broken and with broken spirits, rushed back towards the City of Lanka."
6-93-30,"That battle-field, with elephants, foot-soldiers and horses killed, looked like apleasure-grave of the powerful and the enraged the lord of destruction."
6-93-31,"Then, the celestials along with Gandharvas the celestial musicians, holy saints andgreat sages acclaimed that feat of Rama, saying ""well done, well done!""."
6-93-32,"Then, the virtuous Rama spoke also to Sugreeva, Vibhishana, Hanuma the monkey,Jambavan, Mainda the foremost of monkeys and even Dvivida, who were in close proximity to him asfollows ""Such wonderful power of this missile exists either with me or with the three-eyed Rudrathe lord of destruction."""
6-93-33,"Rama, a compeer of Indra the lord of celestials, the great souled, unwearied in theuse of weapons and missiles, having destroyed that army of demons, was applauded by the rejoicedtroops of celestials."
6-94-1,"Rama, who was unweary in action, with his shining arrows adorned with pure gold,killed those thousands of elephants dispatched by Ravana, thousands of horses, valiant demons whocan change their form at will mounted on thousands of chariots with their flag-staffs, having thecolour of fire, fighting with maces and iron rods and conspicuous with their golden banners."
6-94-2,"Seeing and hearing about the killing of the demons, the surviving demons wellfrightened, looked sad and were overwhelmed with anxiety. They wailed when they met their wives.All female-demons who lost their husbands, sons and kinsfolk met at one place, stricken as theywere with sorrow, wailed as follows:"
6-94-3,"How did the old and ugly Surpanakha, of sunken belly, approach, in the forest, Ramawho is charming like the god of love?"
6-94-4,"How strange that on seeing that Rama of tender youth, endowed with extraordinarystrength and devoted to the welfare of all created beings, that ugly woman (Surpanakha) whodeserved to be condemned by the people, was stung with excessive lust?"
6-94-5,"How that ugly-faced demoness, who is bereft of all virtues, dared to make love toRama, who is full of virtues, endowed with great bodily strength and who possessed a charmingcountenance?"
6-94-6,"Because of the ill-luck of these people, and to the destruction of demons and ofDushana and Khara, that grey-haired and disgusting woman, who had developed wrinkles, tried to bearrogant with Rama, misdeed which was worth ridiculing and condemned by the whole world."
6-94-7,"For the sake of that Surpanakha, Ravana built this huge enmity. For his owndestruction, Ravana the demon brought that Seetha."
6-94-8,"Ravana cannot obtain Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, but an endless enmity has beenbuilt with the mighty Rama."
6-94-9,"Seeing that instance of Rama killing single-handedly Viradha the demon, who wasyearning for Seetha, is enough indeed (to convince Ravana of Rama's strength and ability)"
6-94-10,"In Janasthana, Rama killed fourteen thousand demons who were doing terrific feats,with his arrows resembling tongues of fire."
6-94-11,"In that battle, Khara, Dushana and Trishira were killed with arrows resembling thesun. That instance should have been sufficient (to open the eyes of Ravana)."
6-94-12,"Further, that Kabandha having arms with a length of eight miles each, with blood ashis food and roaring with anger was killed. That instance should have been sufficient."
6-94-13,"Rama killed the mighty Vali, the son of Indra the lord of celestials, looking likethe black cloud. That instance should have been sufficient. (To open the eyes of Ravana)"
6-94-14,"The kingdom was restored to the miserable Sugreeva, who was residing in MountRishyamuka, living with his wishes disappointed. That instance should prove sufficient. (To openthe eyes of Ravana)."
6-94-15,"The appropriate advice tendered by Vibhishana which was conformable to duty andinterest of Ravana as also beneficial to all the demons, was not to the liking to him, due to hisignorance."
6-94-16,"Had Ravana followed Vibhishana's advice, this Lanka would not have become a burialground, tormented by sorrow."
6-94-17,"Ravana is not able to learn a lesson, even after hearing that the mightyKumbhakarna was killed by Rama and that unconquerable colossal-bodied Indrajit, his beloved son waskilled by Lakshmana."
6-94-18,"Ravana is not able to learn a lesson, even after hearing that the mightyKumbhakarna was killed by Rama and that the unconquerable colossal-bodied Indrajit, his beloved sonwas killed by Lakshmana."
6-94-19,"The valiant Rama killed hundreds and thousands of chariots, horses and elephants inthe battle. He killed even the foot soldiers too."
6-94-20,"Rama, coming in the form of either Rudra the lord of destruction or Vishnu, thelord of preservation, or Indra the lord of celestials who performed one hundred ritual sacrifices,or otherwise Yama, the Lord of Death himself, is killing us."
6-94-21,"As Rama killed all our great warriors, we are lamenting with a loss of hope in ourlives, failing to see an end to our fear and having become helpless."
6-94-22,"The valiant Ravana, having been gifted with great boons by Brahma, is not able tounderstand this greatly terrific calamity, coming forth from the hand of Rama."
6-94-23,"Neither the celestials nor Gandharvas the celestial musicians nor the evil spiritsnor the demons are able to protect Ravana, who is about to attack Rama in battle."
6-94-24,"Bad omens are appearing for Ravana, as and when his warriors are setting out foreach combat. They are indeed telling about the prospective annihilation of Ravana by Rama."
6-94-25,"Brahma, the lord of creation, gratified by the austerity of Ravana, gave protectionto Ravana from celestials, demons and ogres. But Ravana did not seek protection from humanbeings."""
6-94-26,"I think that such a calamity has come from that humanity only dreadfully causing anend to the lives for the demons and for Ravana too. There is no doubt about it."
6-94-27,"The celestials, tormented by the mighty Ravana, because of the misuse of the boonbestowed on him, worshipped Brahma the lord of creation with their glowing austerities."
6-94-28,"The great-souled Brahma, duly gratified, spoke for the benefit of those celestials,the following words to them:"
6-94-29,"From today onwards, all the ogres and demons, constantly enveloped with fear, willbe wandering always in the three worlds."
6-94-30,"All the celestials together with Indra and others, got propitiated by Shiva thelord of destruction, with the ensign of a bull on his flag-staff and who destroyed the three strongcities built of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth for demons."
6-94-31,"The gracious Shiva spoke the following words to the celestials: 'For your benefit,a woman will be born, for causing destruction of the demons.'"
6-94-32,"This Seetha, the destroyer of demons, employed by the celestials, will consume usalong with Ravana, as in the past hunger consumed the demons."
6-94-33,"As a result of the bad behaviour of Ravana, the wicked demon with an evildisposition of mind, this terrific havoc with grief occurred."
6-94-34,"Rama is occupying us, as the Death occupies at the time of dissolution of theuniverse. We do not find any one now, who can give protection to us in this world."
6-94-35,"There is no refuge whatsoever for us, who stand in great danger, as indeed there isno shelter for female-elephants, enveloped by a wild fire in a forest."
6-94-36,"The great-souled Vibhishana did something opportune. He sought refuge in him alonefrom whom such a peril is perceived."
6-94-37,"Then, all female-demons, embracing each other in their arms, afflicted as they werewith grief and tormented with excessive fear, lamented thus and wept loudly and severely."
6-95-1,"Ravana for his part heard the mournful and plaintive cry of the afflictedfemale-demons in every house at Lanka."
6-95-2,"Sighing for a long time and remaining engrossed in reflection for a while, thatRavana was very much enraged and assumed a frightful appearance."
6-95-3,"Nipping his lips with his teeth, his eyes becoming blood-red with anger, and hissight becoming difficult to endure even for the demons, Ravana looked like the augmented fire ofdissolution."
6-95-4,"Ravana, in words indistinct with anger as though consuming them with his glance,ordered the demons, standing there near him, viz. Mahodara, Mahaparshva and Virupaksha, the demon(as follows): ""Tell the armies asking them to start immediately, as per my command."""
6-95-5,"Hearing that command of Ravana, those demons were tormented with fear and enjoinedthose armies of demons, who felt unagitated, in accordance with the orders of the king."
6-95-6,"Saying, 'so it be', all those demons of terrible aspect, praying for the blessing ofthe Almighty for averting evil, sallied forth, with their faces turned towards thebattle-field."
6-95-7,"Paying reverence to Ravana according to the rules of propriety, all those greatcar-warriors stood with joined palms, wishing victory to their lord."
6-95-8,"Laughing heartily, Ravana then, stupefied as he was with anger, spoke to thosedemons viz. Mahodara, Mahaparshva and Virupaksha, the demons as follows:"
6-95-9,"Today, I will send Rama and Lakshmana to the abode of Death, with my arrows lookingsimilar to the sun at the time of dissolution of the Universe."
6-95-10,"By killing the enemies now, I will take vengeance for Khara, Kumbhakarna, Prahastaand Indrajit."
6-95-11,"The sky overcast by my arrows, like clouds, will not be distinctly seen. Neitherthe quarters, nor the heaven, nor the seas will come to view."
6-95-12,"With a multitude of plumed arrows joined with my bow, I will kill, by turns, thetroops of monkey-chiefs today."
6-95-13,"By mounting on a chariot, having a speed equal to that of wind, I will destroytoday the armies of monkeys, with waves of arrows arising out of the ocean of my bow."
6-95-14,"Like an elephant, today I will destroy ponds in the form of troops of monkeysshining like the filaments of lotus, with their faces resembling full-blown lotuses."
6-95-15,"With their faces transfixed with arrows, the monkey-leaders, lying on thebattle-field today will adorn the earth as with lotuses together with the stalks."
6-95-16,"With each arrow released in battle today, I shall tear one hundred full of monkeys,the most furious of their troop, fighting with trees."
6-95-17,"By killing the enemy today, I shall wipe off the tears of those demons, who losttheir brothers and sons."
6-95-18,"With the monkeys pierced with my arrows, lying scattered in the battle-field andbereft of their lives today, I shall cover the earth so fully, that it would be possible to see itssurface only with effort."
6-95-19,"Today, I shall satiate the crows, vultures and all those other creatures which eatthe flesh, with the flesh of enemies, struck by my arrows."
6-95-20,"Arrange my chariot quickly. Bring my bow swiftly. Let all the remaining demonshere, follow me to the combat."
6-95-21,"Hearing that command of Ravana, Mahaparshva ordered the army-chiefs, standing there,as follows: ""let the army be made ready quickly."""
6-95-22,"Going around the city of Lanka, the army-chiefs for their part, with quickresolution, joined hand in hand and hastened the demons in every house to set out for thebattle."
6-95-23,"The demons, of terrible aspect and having awful faces, then roaring, with their armsequipped with various weapons viz. swords, sharp-edged darts, pikes, maces, clubs, plough-likeweapons, sharp-edged javelins, huge Kutas and Mudgara, staffs, discuses of every kind, sharpenedaxes, slings for throwing stones, stones or cylindrical wooden pieces with iron pikes and otherexcellent weapons, rushed out within a moment."
6-95-24,"Then, as per the orders of Ravana, the army-commander hurriedly brought a chariot,moving swiftly, along with a charioteer and yoked with eight horses. Thereupon, the awful Ravanamounted that chariot, shining with his own splendour."
6-95-25,"Then, surrounded by several demons, Ravana sallied forth quickly, as though he wascracking the earth with a profundity of his strength."
6-95-26,"Thereupon, a great noise emanated on all sides from tabors, drums, Kettle-drums andcounches along with the clamour of the demons."
6-95-27,"A clamour was heard, saying ""There comes the ruler of demons, the abductor ofSeetha, the destroyer of Brahmanas, the enemy of gods, notorious for his bad conduct, accompaniedby his canopy and pair of whisks, to fight with Rama, the foremost among the Raghu dynasty."""
6-95-28,"By that huge sound, the earth trembled. Hearing that sound suddenly, the monkeys ranaway in fear."
6-95-29,"The long-armed Ravana, for his part, with extra-ordinary energy, surrounded by hisministers, turned up for victory in quest of victory."
6-95-30,"Mahaparshva and Mahodara as also Virupaksha, who was difficult to overpower, asorder by Ravana, then ascended their chariots."
6-95-31,"Those demons, roaring elatedly, as though cracking the earth, and emitting an awfulluproar, sallied forth, longing for victory."
6-95-32,"Then, the powerful Ravana, resembling the all-destroying Time in the form of Yama,along with his army-troops of demons, set out for the battle with his raised bow."
6-95-33,"Then, that Ravana, the great chariot-warrior, ascending his chariot driven by swifthorses, sallied forth to the gate, where Rama and Lakshmana were."
6-95-34,"Then, the sun lost its radiance. The quarters too were enveloped in darkness. Thebirds emitted fearful notes. The earth too trembled violently."
6-95-35,"The cloud rained blood. The horses stumbled. A vulture descended on the top of theensign. Jackals emitted sinister howls."
6-95-36,"His left eye too throbbed. His left arm trembled. He became pale-faced. His voicewas a little lowered."
6-95-37,"When Ravana the demon was sallying forth for the battle, the following evilphenomena, predicting his death, appeared in the battle-field."
6-95-38,"A meteor with a sound similar to a thunder, fell down from the sky. Ill-omenedvultures together with crows cried out aloud."
6-95-39,"Ignoring these dreadful bad omens due to his ignorance, Ravana marched forward forthe purpose of the massacre in battle, driven as he was by fate."
6-95-40,"On hearing the sound of the chariot of those mighty demons, that army of monkeys tooreturned for the fight."
6-95-41,"A tumultuous battle ensued between those monkeys and demons, who were fond ofvictory and summoning each other for combat with rage."
6-95-42,"Thereupon, the enraged Ravana, with his arrows decked with that army of monkeys."
6-95-43,"Some monkeys had their heads chopped off by Ravana. Some had their hearts pierced.Some were made deprived of their ears."
6-95-44,"Some were struck down breathless. Some were torn in their ribs. Some had theirskulls smashed. Some were deprived of their eyes."
6-95-45,"Whichever side Ravana was coming in his chariot on the battle-field, his eyesrolling in anger, those monkey-warriors, on that side, could not with stand the rapidity of hisarrows."
6-96-1,"The battle-field there, on its part, was strewn on that occasion with those monkeyswhose bodies had thus been torn asunder by Ravana with his arrows."
6-96-2,"Those monkeys could not bear that irresistible descent of arrows loosed by Ravana,any more than moths would bear a blazing fire."
6-96-3,"Those monkeys tormented by sharp arrows, fled away roaring, as elephants run away,when enveloped in flames of fire and getting scorched by them."
6-96-4,"Ravana was marching forward swiftly in that battle-field, blowing away the army ofmonkeys, like the wind blows away large clouds."
6-96-5,"Having brought about with his might the destruction of those monkeys in battle,Ravana quickly approached Rama on the battle-field."
6-96-6,"Seeing those monkeys running away in defeat in that battle, Sugreeva kept Sushena incharge of his army and quickly threw his mind into the fight."
6-96-7,"Keeping that Sushena who was equal to himself, his substitute, that Sugreeva, armedwith the tree as a weapon, marched forward towards the enemy."
6-96-8,"Taking huge rocks and various kinds of trees, all the monkey-warriors followedSugreeva at his side and behind."
6-96-9,"The gigantic Sugreeva roared at a high pitch in the battle-field. Striking with hisblows, he crushed various other chiefs of demons."
6-96-10,"The colossal bodied Sugreeva smashed the demons, as the grown-up trees are smashedby the wind at the time of dissolution of the world."
6-96-11,"Sugreeva rained a hail of rocks on the army of demons, as a cloud rains a shower ofhail-stones on a host of birds in a forest."
6-96-12,"While those demons, thus defeated by Sugreeva, falling on the floor and thenroaring, get diminished in number from all sides, the indomitable Virupaksha the demon, holding abow, pronouncing his name by himself, descended from his chariot and mounted the back of anelephant."
6-96-13,"That mighty Virupaksha, mounting that elephant, then roared a terrific noise andrushed towards the monkeys."
6-96-14,"Virupaksha released dreadful arrows on Sugreeva who was at the front-rank of thearmy. He strengthened his support to the worried demons, by cheering them up."
6-96-15,"Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, when he was struck severely with sharp arrows by thatdemon, shouted loudly. With profuse anger, he set his mind on killing him."
6-96-16,"Uplifting a tree and coming near that huge elephant, the valiant Sugreeva, athorough fighter, struck it on its face."
6-96-17,"That huge elephant, struck with the blow of Sugreeva, receded to a distance of fouryards, sank down and roared too."
6-96-18,"Descending quickly from his wounded elephant, that valiant demon then seizing holdof his sword from a shield made of a bull's hide and advancing in rapid paces, facing towardsSugreeva his enemy, approached him, who stood firm, threatening him as it were."
6-96-19,"Taking a huge rock, which looked like a cloud, that Sugreeva, who felt enraged,threw it on Virupaksha."
6-96-20,"Seeing that rock falling, that highly valiant and excellent of demons then recedingaway, struck him with a sword."
6-96-21,"Wounded by the blow of the sword of that strong demon, Sugreeva became as thoughunconscious on the ground, for a moment."
6-96-22,"Then, bouncing up suddenly in that great battle, Sugreeva, tightening his fist,brought it down on the demon's chest violently."
6-96-23,"Feeling enraged, when struck by the blow of that fist, Virupaksha the demon broughtdown the armour of Sugreeva by his sword at the battle-front. Thus struck by him, Sugreeva felldown from his feet."
6-96-24,"Getting up when fallen, Sugreeva gave him a slap, which produced a terrific soundsimilar to a thunder."
6-96-25,"Setting himself free from that slap, which was about to be raised by Sugreevaskillfully, Virupaksha the demon struck Sugreeva on the chest with his fist."
6-96-26,"Then, seeing that demon escaping his blow, Sugreeva the monkey-king for his part,very much enraged."
6-96-27,"That monkey saw an opportunity to strike that Virupaksha. Then, with anger, Sugreevabrought down another violent slap on his temple-bone."
6-96-28,"Virupaksha, struck by the blow of that palm, which was like the thunderbolt to theground, oozing blood profusely from the (nine) apertures* of his body, as water flows from thespring."
6-96-29,"The monkeys saw Virupaksha, bathed in foaming blood, with his eyes rolling throughanger and as such rendered all the more deformed.*"
6-96-30,"The monkeys saw their enemy, bathed in blood, turning to and from as also throbbingon his sides and roaring piteously."
6-96-31,"Confronting together in the battle-field in that way, those two violent and terrificarmies which were extensive as oceans, of monkeys and demons, roared like two large oceans whichhad burst their bounds."
6-96-32,"Beholding that mighty Virupaksha killed by Sugreeva, the army of monkeys and demonstogether looked like the agitated river of Ganga."
6-97-1,"Being killed by each other in that major battle, those two armies were very muchdiminished soon, like two lakes in a severe summer."
6-97-2,"Ravana the lord of demons got doubly enraged because of the destroyal of his ownarmy and the fall of Virupaksha."
6-97-3,"He felt restless to find his own army diminished while being killed by the monkeysand to see the reversal of his fate."
6-97-4,"He spoke to Mahodara, the annihilator of enemies, standing beside him (as follows):""O the long-armed! At this juncture, my hope for victory is centered in you."""
6-97-5,"O the brave demon! Destroy the army of our enemies. Show your prowess now. This isthe time to repay the debt of your master (received in the form of sustenance from him). Fightwell."
6-97-6,"Hearing the words of Ravana, Mahodara the chief of demons saying ""So it be"",penetrated into the army of enemies, as a moth rushed into a flame."
6-97-7,"Emboldened by the words of his master, that mighty demon, with full of energy,destroyed the monkeys by dint of his own valour."
6-97-8,"Taking hold of huge rocks and penetrating the terrific army of enemies, those highlystrong monkeys too started killing all the demons."
6-97-9,"In that great battle, the highly enraged Mahodara, with his arrows decked in gold,chopped off the hands, feet and thighs of monkeys."
6-97-10,"Then, among all those monkeys who were tormented by the demons, some ran away intoten directions. Some others sought refuge with Sugreeva."
6-97-11,"Seeing the large army of monkeys defeated in the battle, Sugreeva rushed towardsMahodara who was immediately close to him."
6-97-12,"Seizing hold of a large and terrific rock, which looked like a mountain, Sugreevawho was endowed with a great energy, hurled it with an aim to kill the demon."
6-97-13,"Seeing that rock falling suddenly, Mahodara, then unagitated, tore it with hisarrows, though it was difficult to approach."
6-97-14,"That rock, broken to a thousand pieces by that demon with a multitude of his arrows,forthwith fell down on earth, like a flock of frightened vultures."
6-97-15,"Filled with rage on seeing that rock broken and uprooting a Sala tree, Sugreevahurled it at his enemy and Mahodara chopped it off into many pieces."
6-97-16,"The valiant Mahodara, who was the tormentator of hostile forces, lacerated Sugreevawith his arrows. That enraged Sugreeva then saw an iron rod on the ground."
6-97-17,"Swinging that flashing iron rod and showing it to him, Sugreeva killed the excellenthorses of Mahodara with that iron rod of terrible speed."
6-97-18,"Jumping down from that huge chariot, whose horses had been killed, that valiantMahodara the demon, thereupon seized hold of a mace with anger."
6-97-19,"With a mace and an iron road respectively in their hands and roaring like two bullsand resembling like two clouds charged with lightning, those two heroes closed in for a battle."
6-97-20,"Mahodara the demon was angry with Sgureeva and thereupon hurled his blazing mace,which shone like the sun, on Sugreeva."
6-97-21,"Seeing that highly terrible mace, falling on him in that great battle, the mightySugreeva, the King of monkeys, was enraged with red eyes and struck that mace, by lifting up theiron rod. That iron rod broke off and fell on the ground."
6-97-22,"Thereupon, the spirited Sugreeva took hold of a formidable steel club, entirelydecked with gold, from the earth-surface."
6-97-23,"Lifting that steel club, Sugreeva hurled it. Mahodara too hurled another mace onhim. Those two weapons, clashing each other, broke and fell on the floor."
6-97-24,"As all their weapons were broken, those two warriors, who were endowed with spiritand strength, resembling two blazing fires, started contending with fists."
6-97-25,"Roaring again and again, those two warriors then banged each other. Slapping eachother with their palms, they rolled on the earth's surface."
6-97-26,"They raised quickly on their feet and then began to strike each other. Remainingunyielded, the two heroes pushed each other on their shoulders."
6-97-27,"Those two heroes, the annihilators their enemies, felt exhausted in the course oftheir wrestling. Then the highly fast Mahodara the demon took hold of a sword and a shield, lyingnot very far."
6-97-28,"In the same way, the highly swift Sugreeva the foremost of monkeys took hold of alarge sword together with a shield, lying there."
6-97-29,"Thereupon, those two warriors, who were skilled in the use of weaponry in thebattle-field and whose limbs were seized with anger, galloped forward, roaring with joy, with theirswords upraised."
6-97-30,"With their thoughts concentrated on one point of victory, both the warriors wereenraged with each other and performed circumambulations form left to right, very quickly."
6-97-31,"That valiant and evil-minded Mahodara, who was boasting of his own prowess, let fallwith very high speed, that sword on the heavy shield of Sugreeva."
6-97-32,"Even while Mahodara was extracting his sword which had got struck in the shield,Sugreeva severed with his own sword, Mahodara's head, which was adorned with ear-rings andhelmet."
6-97-33,"While Mahodara, with his head chopped off, was falling on the ground, Ravana's army,on seeing it, could no longer be seen on the battle-field."
6-97-34,"Having killed Mahodara, Sugreeva made a rejoicing roar with his monkeys. Ravana wasenraged. Rama looked rejoicing."
6-97-35,"With their faces looking low-spirited all the demons felt dejected. With their mindsstricken with fear, all of them ran away from the battle-field."
6-97-36,"Having thrown down to the ground that Mahodara, looking like a part of a hugemountain lying shattered the invincible Sugreeva shone in glory in the battle-field like the sunshines with its rays."
6-97-37,"Having attained victory in the battle-front, Sugreeva then continued to be looked atby the multitude of gods, Siddhas (a class of demigods who are endowed with mystic powers) andYakshas (another class of demigods attending on Kubera, the god of riches) as also a host of beingsstanding on the earth's surface who were all overwhelmed with joy."
6-98-1,"Seeing Mahodara killed by Sugreeva, the mighty Mahaparsva for his part with hisred-blood eyes through anger, forthwith stirred up the terrific army of Angada with his arrows."
6-98-2,"That demon struck down the heads of monkey-chiefs from their trunks, as wind wouldthrow down a fruit from its stalk."
6-98-3,"Moreover, that demon very quickly chopped off the arms of some monkeys with hisarrows and struck down the region of the ribs of others."
6-98-4,"Tormented by the flight of arrows of Mahaparshva, all those monkeys were downcastwith despair and lost heart."
6-98-5,"Seeing his army depressed on being tormented by the demon, Angada who was endowedwith a great impetuosity, exhibited his tempo like an ocean on full-moon days."
6-98-6,"Taking hold of a steel rod, with its radiance equal to that of the sun, hurled it onMahaparshva in that combat."
6-98-7,"By that blow, that Mahaparsva dropped senseless and unconscious on the ground fromhis chariot along with is charioteer"
6-98-8,"The energetic Jambavan, looking like a heap of black collyrium, who was exceedinglypowerful, battalion which resembled a black cloud a mountain-peak, killed his horses with hisstrength and broke that chariot too."
6-98-9,"Regaining his consciousness within a while, the mighty Mahaparshva again struckAngada with his many arrows."
6-98-10,"He struck Jambavan, the king of bears with three arrows in his chest and struckGavaksha too with many arrows."
6-98-11,"Seeing Gavaksha and Jambavan tormented by the arrows, that Angada was infatuatedwith anger and seized hold of a terrific iron rod."
6-98-12,"Firmly holding that iron rod, which shone like the rays of the sun, with both handsand turning it around with force, Angada son of Vali, his eyes red with anger, hurled it on thatMahaparshva the demon, who stood at a distance, with an intention to kill him."
6-98-13,"Hurled by the mighty Angada, that iron rod for its part, knocked the bow with thearrow fitted to it, from the demon's hand and also his helmet."
6-98-14,"Approaching him with speed and with anger, the valiant Angada slapped him on thetemple (root of the ear), shining with an ear-ring."
6-98-15,"Enraged as he was, that Mahaparsva for his part, who was endowed with a greatswiftness and enormous splendour, seized hold of a huge axe in one hand."
6-98-16,"Extremely enraged, the demon hurled that stainless and strong axe, which had beenwashed in oil and which was made of steel, on Angada."
6-98-17,"Full of anger, that Angada evaded that axe, which had been aimed by him mostly athis left shoulder-bone."
6-98-18,"That valiant Angada, with his prowess equal to that of his father, was quite enragedand firmly tightened his fist resembling a thunder-bolt."
6-98-19,"Knowing the vital parts of the body, Angada pounced his fist, which invaded like athunderbolt, on the boson of the demon, in the vicinity of his breasts."
6-98-20,"With the blow of that fist in that great combat, the fleshy part of his heart wasblasted and he fell dead on the ground."
6-98-21,"When Mahaparshva fell dead on the ground, his army got confused. A mammoth angerarose in Ravana."
6-98-22,"That highly profound lion's roar of the rejoiced monkeys, by its noise, was welllike the loud sound of the gods along with Indra the lord celestials, nay, by its vibrationsbreaking asunder as it were the City of Lanka with its attics and town-gates."
6-98-23,"Hearing the loud noise of monkeys, as also of the celestials in the battle-field,the enraged Ravana the adversary of Indra, then stood prepared for a battle again."
6-99-1,"Seeing Mahodara and Mahaparshva the demons having been killed, and that valiant andmighty Virupaksha struck down in that great battle, a tremendous anger took possession of Ravana.He urged on his charioteer and addressed to him the following words:"
6-99-2,"Killing those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, I will remove surely the sorrowcaused to me on account of the ministers who have been killed and the city which has been laidsiege to (by the monkeys)."
6-99-3,"In the battle, I will cut down the tree in the shape of Rama, which is going toyield fruit through its flower in the form of Seetha, whose principal branches are Sugreeva,Jambavan, Kumuda, Nala, Dvivida, Mainda, Angada, Gandhamadana, Hanuma, Sushena and all the chiefsof monkey-warriors."
6-99-4,"Ravana, the mighty and the surpassing Chariot-Warrior, went quickly, making a noisein all the ten directions, with the sound of the chariot, rushing towards Rama."
6-99-5,"Filled with that sound, the entire earth, with its rivers, mountains and forests,trembled, throwing lions, antelopes and birds, into fright."
6-99-6,"He employed very highly terrific and exceedingly frightful mystic missile calledTamasa, which began to consume all the monkeys, who started falling down on all sides."
6-99-7,"Dust began to fly up from the earth, while those frustrated monkeys were fleeingaway for they could no longer bear that missile built by Brahma himself."
6-99-8,"Seeing those hundreds of many of his armies shattered by excellent arrows of Ravana,Rama took his stand, ready for the battle."
6-99-9,"Having driven away the army of monkeys, Ravana the foremost among the demons thensaw Rama, the annihilator of his enemies, who was endowed with long arms and eyes as wide as lotuspetals standing unconquered with his brother Lakshmana-like Indra the lord of celestials is seenwith Vishnu, the supreme lord of preservation-holding up his great bow as though scraping thesky."
6-99-10,"Seeing the disappointed monkeys and Ravana advancing, the mighty Rama who wasendowed with a great splendour and accompanied by Lakshmana who were born in Raghu dynasty, thenpleasingly seized his bow at the middle."
6-99-11,"Thereupon, Rama began to stretch his excellent bow, which was endowed with greatforce and sonorous, as though he was breaking the earth asunder."
6-99-12,"Then, due to that buzzing sound produced by the streams of Ravana's arrows as alsoby the twang of Rama's bow, those demons fell down in their hundreds."
6-99-13,"That Ravana, coming within the range of arrow-shots of Rama and Lakshmana, resembledRahu (the demon who is supposed to seize the sun and the moon), standing in the vicinity of themoon and the sun."
6-99-14,"Wishing to fight him with his sharp arrows at the earliest, Lakshmana stretching hisbow, released his arrows which were like flames of fire."
6-99-15,"Ravana of extra ordinary energy prevented those arrows, the moment they werereleased by Lakshmana, with his arrows, in the sky itself."
6-99-16,"Showing the dexterity of his hand, Ravana split the arrows of Lakshmana one withone, three with three and ten with ten arrows."
6-99-17,"Overpassing Lakshmana, Ravana the victorious in battle, approached Rama, who stoodlike another mountain, in the battle-field."
6-99-18,"Having approached Rama, Ravana the lord of demons, having his eyes turning red-bloodthrough anger, released streams of arrows upon him."
6-99-19,"Just on seeing streams of arrows coming forth, loosed from Ravana's bow, Ramathereupon quickly seized hold of 'Bhalla'* arrows in haste."
6-99-20,"Then, Rama tore off that multitude of arrows, which were blazing and looking veryterrific like enraged serpents, with his sharp Bhalla - arrows."
6-99-21,"Rama on Ravana and Ravana on Rama, quickly showered each other with streams ofsharp-pointed arrows of various kinds."
6-99-22,"Pushing back each other with the velocity of their arrows and remaining undefeated,the two warriors described circles of different kinds each moving from left to right, for a longtime."
6-99-23,"Created beings were frightened, even as both the terrific warriors were fighting allat once, releasing their arrows at each other, thus resembling the god of retribution and the godof Death respectively."
6-99-24,"The sky at that time became dense with arrows of various kinds, even as it iscovered, at the end of the monsoon, with clouds crowded with crowns of lightning."
6-99-25,"The sky was studded as with eye-holes, by showers of arrows of high velocity, whichwere extremely sharp-pointed and adorned with plumes of vultures and were loosed with highspeed."
6-99-26,"They initially made the sky dark with arrows. Even after the sun-set, they made itdark, like two huge clouds risen in it."
6-99-27,"A great combat ensued between both of them, who were willing to kill each other.That battle was unimaginable and unapproachable, like the duel that took place between Vritra thedemon and Indra the lord of celestials."
6-99-28,"Both the warriors were excellent archers. Both were skilled in war-fare. Both wereeminently skilled in the use of missiles. Both moved unhindered in the battle-field."
6-99-29,"In whichever course both of them went, in the same respective direction, streams ofarrows went, like waves in two oceans, whipped by the wind."
6-99-30,"Ravana, having skilful hands and a cause for the cry of the world, released a row ofsteel arrows on Rama's forehead."
6-99-31,"Rama endured on his head, that row of steel arrows, having a lustre of blacklotus-petals, discharged from the terrific bow. He did not get perturbed."
6-99-32,"Thereupon, seizing hold of more arrows, reciting sacred incantations and making useof the missile presided over by Rudra and stretching his bow, the valiant Rama of great splendourwas filled with anger and released those arrows."
6-99-33,"Fallen on the unbreakable armour of Ravana, which looked like a large cloud, thosearrows could not cause any pain to him at that time."
6-99-34,"Rama, who was skilled in the use of all types of mystic missiles, forthwith piercedin the forehead, yet again by a paramount missile, that Ravana seated in his chariot."
6-99-35,"Having pierced the frames of arrows of Ravana, Rama's arrows penetrated likefive-headed hissing serpents into the earth, when rebuffed by Ravana."
6-99-36,"Striking down Rama's missile, that Ravana, who was stupefied with anger, employedanother exceedingly terrific missile presided over by demoniac forces."
6-99-37,"He released sharp arrows, having the heads of lions and tigers, those of buzzardsand crows, even of vultures and faloons, as well as those of jackals and wolves, arrows with theirmouths wide open, having the heads of venomous snakes with five heads, bringing fear."
6-99-38,"Hissing like a serpent provoked to anger Ravana who was endowed with extraordinaryenergy and conjuring tricks, released towards Rama these and other arrows, having the heads ofdonkeys, those of boars, dogs and cocks as also of alligators and venomous snakes."
6-99-39,"Possessed by a missile presided over by demoniac forces, that Rama endowed with agreat strength and resembling the god of fire, released a missile presided over by the god offire."
6-99-40,"Rama employed there, various kinds of arrows, with heads bright as fire, others withheads shining like the sun, the moon, the crescent, a comet, others shining like planets, lunarmansions and a huge meteor and some arrows resembling flashes of lightning."
6-99-41,"Struck by Rama's missile, the terrific arrows of Ravana got destroyed in the sky andfell down in thousands of pieces."
6-99-42,"Rejoiced to see that missile struck down by Rama, who was unweary in action, all thevaliant monkeys, who were capable of changing their form at will, then encompassing Rama, raised aclamour, facing Sugreeva."
6-99-43,"Striking down with force that missile which came forth from Ravana's arms, thegreat-souled Rama, then was filled with rejoice while the chiefs of monkeys, full f joy, shoutedloudly."
6-100-1,"When that missile was made defunct, Ravana the king of demons, for his part, doubledhis fury and in his anger, began to employ another missile immediately."
6-100-2,"Ravana, who was endowed with extraordinary splendour, started to release anothercruel and terrific missile built by Maya the demon, on Rama."
6-100-3,"Then, from that bow, came forth, blazing pikes, maces and clubs, which were hard asadamant, on all sides."
6-100-4,"Various kinds of furious mallets, deceptive nooses and blazing thunderbolts cameforth, like piercing gales at the time of the destruction of the world."
6-100-5,"The glorious Rama, the foremost among the knower in the use of excellent missilesand who was endowed with extra ordinary splendour, struck down that missile with an excellentmissile presided over by Gandharvas the celestial musicians."
6-100-6,"When that missile was made defunct by the great souled Rama, Ravana with his copperyeyes in anger, employed a missile presided over by the sun-god."
6-100-7,"Then came forth resplendent and large discuses, from the bow of that intelligentRavana, of terrific impetuosity."
6-100-8,"Even as they came forth and falling on all sides, the sky was blazing and thequarters illuminated, as by the moon, the sun and other planets."
6-100-9,"In the forefront of Ravana's army, that Rama split those discuses and other strangeweapons, with a multitude of arrows."
6-100-10,"Seeing that missile struck down, Ravana the king of demons, for his part, piercedRama with ten arrows in all his vital parts."
6-100-11,"Eventhough that Ravana struck Rama with those ten arrows released from his greatbow, Rama of extraordinary energy was not shaken."
6-100-12,"Then, Rama the victorious in battle, was quite enraged and struck Ravana in all hisorgans with a multitude of arrows."
6-100-13,"In the meantime, the mighty and enraged Lakshmana, Rama's younger brother, thedestroyer of valiant enemies, seized hold of seven arrows."
6-100-14,"Lakshmana of great brilliance, with those arrows of high velocity, tore off intomany pieces, the flag-staff of Ravana, which bore the emblem of a man's head."
6-100-15,"The glorious and mighty Lakshmana, with a single arrow, tore the head of Ravana'scharioteer, which was adorned with blazing ear-rings."
6-100-16,"With five sharp arrows, Lakshmana then chopped off Ravana's bow, which looked likean elephant's trunk."
6-100-17,"Bouncing forward, Vibhishana killed, with his mace, the excellent horses of Ravana,which looked like black clouds and were tall as mountains."
6-100-18,"Leaping down with speed from his large chariot, whose horses had been killed, Ravanathen exhibited a violent anger towards the younger brother of Rama."
6-100-19,"Then, Ravana, of great energy and prowess, hurled a spear looking like a blazingthunderbolt, on Vibhishana."
6-100-20,"Even before the spear reached Vibhishana, Lakshmana tore it with three of his arrowsand a loud cheer then arose from the monkeys in the battle-field."
6-100-21,"That gold-crowned spear, torn into three pieces, fell like a large meteor withsparks of fire falling from the sky."
6-100-22,"Thereupon, Ravana took hold of another large most competent spear, which wasdifficult to be approached even by Yama the lord of Death and blazing as it was, with its ownsplendour."
6-100-23,"The mighty and the evil-minded Ravana swiftly hurled that very great spear, burningwith a radiance similar to that of a blazing thunder-bolt."
6-100-24,"In the meanwhile, the valiant Lakshmana quickly rushed towards that Vibhishana, whogot a danger to his life."
6-100-25,"To rescue that Vibhishana, the heroic Lakshmana, having stretched his bow, threw outstreams of arrows on Ravana who was holding a spear in his hand."
6-100-26,"Poured in with a multitude of arrows discharged by the great-souled Lakshmana,Ravana with his attach frustrated, did not make up his mind to attack Vibhishana further."
6-100-27,"Seeing Vibhishana his brother rescued by Lakshmana, that Ravana, turning his facetowards Lakshmana spoke the following words:"
6-100-28,"O Lakshmana, exalter of your own strength! As Vibhishana was rescued by you in thisway, this spear, on letting off Vibhishana the demon, is being hurled on you now."
6-100-29,"This spear, having blood-marks and hurled by bludgeon-like arm, having pierced yourheart, will depart only after taking your life."
6-100-30,"Thus saying, the greatly enraged Ravana roared and hurled towards Lakshmana, thatunfailing spear, which was adorned with eight loudly clamouring bells, which had been designed byMaya the demon by dint of his conjuring trick, capable of destroying adversaries and blazing as itwas with splendour."
6-100-31,"That spear, with a sound equal to Indra's thunder-bolt, hurled by the terribly swiftRavana, soon fell with speed on Lakshmana in the battle-front."
6-100-32,"Rama repeatedly uttered to that spear even as it was rushing forth (on Lakshmana) asfollows: ""May it be well with Lakshmana! May you prove useless! May your effort be frustrated!"""
6-100-33,"That spear, which was looking like a venomous serpent, released by the enragedRavana in the battle, quickly penetrated the bosom of Lakshmana, who stood fearless."
6-100-34,"That spear, like the tongue of Vasuki (the lord of serpents), blazing with a greatdazzle, fell on the broad chest of Lakshmana, with enormous speed."
6-100-35,"Penetrated very deeply and pierced through his heart by the spear due to the forceexerted by Ravana, Lakshmana fell to the ground."
6-100-36,"Seeing Lakshmana in that state, Rama, of extraordinary splendour, who was stationedin the vicinity, became sorrowful at heart because of the love towards his brother."
6-100-37,"Rama, whose eyes were filled with tears, reflected just for a while and then wasvery much enraged, like fire at the time of dissolution of the world."
6-100-38,"Becoming aware that it was not the time for feeling despondent, and looking atLakshmana, Rama resumed that highly tumultuous battle with a great and whole-hearted endeavour,determined as he was to destroy Ravana."
6-100-39,"Then, Rama saw Lakshmana, who was struck by the spear in that Great War, bathed ashe was in blood and looking like a mountain with a snake (entering its centre)."
6-100-40,"Even with an exertion to pull out that spear hurled by the mighty Ravana, thoseforemost of the monkeys could not those foremost of the monkeys could not do it because they werebeing tormented by Ravana the foremost of demons with a stream of his arrows."
6-100-41,"Penetrating through Lakshmana's bosom, that spear touched the earth. Seizing hold ofawful spear with his hands, the mighty Rama drew it out and getting enraged, broke it during thecourse of the battle."
6-100-42,"While Rama was drawing the spear out; arrow, which pierced his vital organs, weresunk by the mighty Ravana on all his limbs."
6-100-43,"Ignoring those arrows and having embraced Lakshmana, Rama spoke to Hanuma andSugreeva, the king of monkeys, as follows:"
6-100-44,"O the chiefs of monkeys! Remain just encompassing Lakshmana. Let this maliciousRavana of evil designs be killed. The time to manifest my prowess, which I have been wishing forlong, has come, as for a chataka bird, the site of a cloud would come, as sought by it, at the endof a hot season."
6-100-45,"I take this vow in truth before you, at this moment, O monkeys, that without delay,you will see the world devoid of Ravana or Rama (myself)."
6-100-46,"I encountered with the loss of sovereignity, the dwelling in the forest, thewandering around in the woods of Dandaka and the rough treatment of Seetha by the demons."
6-100-47,"A great and terrible suffering has happened to me and an agony equivalent to hell.Now, by killing Ravana in battle, I will relieve myself of all that agony."
6-100-48,"That sinful demon, for whose sake, this army of monkeys has been brought by me,Sugreeva has been anointed on the throne after killing Vali and for whose sake the ocean has beencrossed and a bridge built on it, has come within the range of my sight in the battle-fieldnow."
6-100-49,"This Ravana, having come within the range of my vision, cannot survive, any morethan the one who has come within the range of vision of a snake injecting deadly poison with itsvery glance or than a serpent who has come within the range of vision of Garuda, the king of birdsand the enemy of serpents."
6-100-50,"O the foremost of the monkeys who are so difficult to conquer! Seated on themountain-peaks, you witness at ease, this battle between myself and Ravana."
6-100-51,"Let the three worlds (viz. the earth, heaven and the intermediate region) includingGandharvas the celestial musicians, the gods, the sages and the celestial bards see today theRamahood of Rama during the course of my battle."
6-100-52,"I shall perform today a feat, which people in the world including all living beingsboth mobile and immobile, as also gods, will ever narrate together, describing how the battleproceeded, as long as the earth is able to support those who occupy it."
6-100-53,"Thus speaking, Rama with an attentive mind in the battle-field, struck Rama withsharp arrows, decked in pure gold."
6-100-54,"Thereupon, Ravana streamed forth blazing steel arrows and then clubs, as cloudswould stream forth the rains."
6-100-55,"A tumultuous sound arose from the excellent arrows, released by Rama and Ravana, asthey struck each other."
6-100-56,"The arrows of Rama and Ravana, split asunder and scattered off, with their blazingpoints, fell from the space on to the surface of the earth."
6-100-57,"The loud sound, produced by the impact of the bow-string on the palms of those twoheroes Rama and Ravana, which struck terror in all the living beings, was felt astonished by theaudience."
6-100-58,"Torn asunder by the streams of a multitude of arrows by the great-souled Rama, whowas armed with a blazing bow, while coming in collusion with him, Ravana took to his heels out offear, like a cloud when pushed by a tempest."
6-101-1,"Seeing the valiant Lakshmana bathed in a stream of blood, when struck down in battlewith a spear by the mighty Ravana and having given a tumultuous fight, to the evil-minded Ravana,Rama spoke as follows to Sushena, even while releasing a multitude of arrows (at Ravana)."
6-101-2,"This heroic Lakshmana, falling down on earth yielding to Ravana's prowess, iswiggling like a serpent, causing an increase in grief to me."
6-101-3,"My energy to fight is failing, even as I see this valiant Lakshmana, who is dearerto me than life, bathed in blood, my mind being greatly disturbed."
6-101-4,"Of what use is life or happiness to me, if this illustrious brother of mine, who isendowed with auspicious bodily marks and who always speaks highly of war, meets with hisdeath?"
6-101-5,"My valour is feeling shy, as it were. My bow seems to fall down from any hand. Myarrows are dropping down. My vision has been overcome with tears."
6-101-6,"My limbs seem to sink down, like those of men in sleep. I have a serious tension,growing in me. I even wish to die."
6-101-7,"My brother has been struck down by the evil-minded Ravana, seriously wounded in hisvital parts, afflicted with agony and groaming."
6-101-8,"Seeing his beloved brother, who was his very life-breath moving outside, Rama wasafflicted with excessive agony and gave himself up to anxiety and grief."
6-101-9,"Seeing Lakshmana his brother lying wounded in the dust of the battle-field, he gotinto extreme despondency and lamented (as follows), confused in mind, as he was:"
6-101-10,"O the valiant Lakshmana! Even victory cannot create a pleasure for me. Whatpleasure can the moon create for a man who has lost his vision?"
6-101-11,"What purpose of mine will be served by fighting or eve by life? When this Lakshmanalies killed in the forefront of battle here, I have no use for the war."
6-101-12,"In the same way as the very glorious Lakshmana followed me When I was going to theforest, I too will in the same way follow him to the abode of Yama the lord of Death."
6-101-13,"The demons, who fight treacherously, created this condition to Lakshmana, who lovedhis relatives and who was ardently devoted forever to me."
6-101-14,"Wives may be obtained ever where. Relatives can be had every where. However, I donot find a brother, born of the same womb, at such a place whatesoever."
6-101-15,"The monkeys saw that Rama, thus lamenting with his mind reeling and distressed ingrief and pitiably sighing his breath repeatedly."
6-101-16,"Of what use is the kingdom for me, without Lakshmana, who was difficult to overpower? What can I tell to Sumitra, the mother who was so fond of her son?"
6-101-17,"I shall not be able to bear the reproach, which will be levelled by Sumitra. Whatshall I pay to kausalya the mother or what shall I say to Kaikeya?"
6-101-18,"What shall I say to Bharata or to the mighty Shatrughna, when they ask me, how Icame back without Lakshmana even though I went to the forest along with him?"
6-101-19,"It is better to die at this place only, rather than hear the reproaches of one'sown people. What sinful act was done by me in a previous birth due to which my righteous brotherlies killed before me?"
6-101-20,"Alas! O the powerful brother, the best of men! O the foremost among the valiantmen! Why are you going to the other world, deserting me?"
6-101-21,"O brother! Why don't you talk to me, even though I am lamenting? Rise and see! Whyare you lying down? See me, by opening your own eyes, miserable as I am."
6-101-22,"O the mighty armed! You have been indeed comforting me, whenever stricken withgrief, I roamed listlessly among mountains and forests or felt low-spirited."
6-101-23,"Comforting Rama, whose mind was full of grief and who was thus lamenting, Sushena,for his part, addressed the following excellent words:"
6-101-24,"O the excellent among men! Give up this notion, which causes despondency in you,this anguish which gives rise to grief and is as piercing as arrows, in the forefront ofbattle."
6-101-25,"Lakshmana, the augmenter of prosperity, has not got into death. His countenance isnot changed, nor has it become dark."
6-101-26,"His face may be seen with a good brightness and very much placid. The palms of hishands are resembling the petals of a lotus. His eyes too are very bright."
6-101-27,"O king! The appearance of the dead does not look like this. O hero, the annihilatorof enemies! He is all with his life. Do not worry."
6-101-28,"The repeatedly beating heart with the signs of breath of Lakshmana, lying on theearth's surface, fast asleep, with his limbs relaxed are telling it, O the gallant prince!"
6-101-29,"Having addressed the words thus to Rama, the highly learned Sushena spoke thefollowing words to Hanuma the great monkey, who was standing nearby:"
6-101-30,"Proceeding from this place with full speed, O gentle one!, to the mountain calledOushadhi (Mahodaya), which was already described to you previously by Jambavan, O brave one! Bringhere for restoring the great-souled and heroic Lakshmana to consciousness, the precious herbVishalyakarani (1) by name which was sprung up on its southern peak, Savarnakarnani (2),Samjivakarani(3) and the precious herb, Samdhanakarani (4)."
6-101-31,"Hearing those words, Hanuma, having sprung to Mount Oushadhi, could not identifythose precious herbs and became thoughtful."
6-101-32,"The following thought arose to that Hanuma, whose strength was unlimited: ""I will goback, taking this mountain-peak itself."""
6-101-33,"By conjecture, I understand that the delightful herb must have sprouted in thismountain-peak. Sushena indeed has said so."
6-101-34,"If I go without taking Vishalyakarani, harm may come through passage of time and agreat perplexity may arise."
6-101-35,"Thinking thus, the mighty Hanuma the excellent of monkeys, having gone quickly andapproaching that excellent mountain, taking that mountain-peak with his arms, shaking it violentlyfor three times and uprooting the mountain-peak, which was endowed with many trees in bloom, liftedit up, so mighty as he was."
6-101-36,"Taking that mountain-peak, which looked like a dark rainy cloud, that Hanuman jumpedup into the sky."
6-101-37,"Arriving with a great speed, Hanuma putting down the mountain-peak and resting for awhile, spoke the following words to Sushena:"
6-101-38,"O the excellent of monkeys! I have brought the entire mountain-peak, as I could notidentify those herbs."
6-101-39,"Eulogizing Hanuma, who was thus narrating his trip, Sushena, the excellent ofmonkeys, pulling out the herbs, took hold off them."
6-101-40,"All those monkey-chiefs and even the gods were surprised to see that most difficultfeat of Hanuma."
6-101-41,"Then, crushign that herb, Sushena the excellent of monkeys, having a greatsplendour, administered it through Lakshmana's nose."
6-101-42,"Duly inhaling it well, that Lakshmana, the annihilator of adversaries, having thespear lodged in his body, raised quickly from the earth's surface rid as he was of the spear andhis pain."
6-101-43,"Seeing that Lakshmana risen from the ground, the mokneys were overjoyed andapplauded Lakshmana, saying, ""Excellent, excellent!""."
6-101-44,"Rama, the destroyer of enemies, said to Lakshmana, ""come, come!"" and embraced himfirmly with affection, with his eyes clouded with tears."
6-101-45,"After embracing Lakshmana, Rama then said to him: ""Luckily, O valiant one, I see youhere, returned from death."""
6-101-46,"There is no purpose of mine, by me own life nor of Seetha nor of victory. If youhave attained demise, tell me what significnace is there for it to me?"
6-101-47,"While the great souled Rama was speaking thus, the exhausted Lakshmana, in a feebletone, spoke the following words:"
6-101-48,"Having solemnly taken that pledge (of killing Ravana) before, O brother true toyour promise, you ought not to speak as you have done like a weak and courageless man."
6-101-49,"There is no purpose of mine, by me own life nor of Seetha nor of victory. If youhave attained demise, tell me what significance is there for it to me?"
6-101-50,"O the faultless one! Getting into homelessness for my sake is not befitting of you.Fulfill your promise now, by killing Ravana."
6-101-51,"An enemy who falls victim to your arrows, cannot turn out alive, as a huge elephantwhich gets into the path of a roaring lion possessing terrible tusks."
6-101-52,"I, for my part, wish to see the death of this evil-minded fellow instantly, evenbefore this sun, having finished his task, does not sink below the horizon."
6-101-53,"O venerable hero! If you wish to kill Ravana in battle, if you wish to fulfill yourpromise and if you feel affectionate towards Seetha, do as I tell you soon and now."
6-102-1,"Hearing those words of Lakshmana, that valiant Rama, the annihilator of his enemies,taking hold of his bow, fixed an arrow on the bow-string."
6-102-2,"In the forefront of battle, Rama released terrific arrows towards Ravana. Then,occupying another chariot, Ravana the king of demons rushed towards Rama, even as Rahu theseizer-demon rushes towards the sun."
6-102-3,"Ravana for his part, standing in his chariot struck Rama with thunderbolt-likearrows, as a cloud strikes gushes of rain on a huge mountain."
6-102-4,"With an attentive mind, Rama showered golden decked arrows, looking like blazingflames of fire, on Ravana in the battle-field."
6-102-5,"The gods, celestial musicians and kinnaras the mythical beings thought that thebattle was not equal between Rama standing on the ground and Ravana fighting from a chariot."
6-102-6,"Hearing their nectar-like words, the illustrious Indra, the chief f celestials thencalled Matali and spoke as follows:"
6-102-7,"Go quickly with my chariot to Rama, who is standing on the earth. After reachingthe earth, invite him to take his seat in the chariot and carry out a great service to thegods."
6-102-8,"Hearing the words of Indra, Matali, the charioteer of Indra, offering salutation tohim by bowing his head, spoke then the following words:"
6-102-9,"O Indra! Providing with green horses the excellent chariot, I will proceed thenimmediately and perform the duty of a charioteer to Rama."
6-102-10,"Then came the glorious and excellent chariot of Indra, having variegated body deckedin gold, which was fitted with hundreds of tiny bells, with its pole of cat's eye gems shone likethe morning sun, yoked to excellent green horses, having golden chaplets on their heads, havingwhite whisks, covered with nets of gold, shining like the sun and bearing a flag-staff raised on agolden bamboo. Ascending the chariot, as enjoined by Indra and descending from paradise, Mataliapproached Rama."
6-102-11,"Then Matali, the charioteer of Indra, along with a whip in his hand, stayed in thechariot itself and joining his palms in salutation, spoke the following words to Rama."
6-102-12,"Indra has sent this chariot to you for your victory, O the mighty and the gloriousRama, the destroyer of adversaries!"
6-102-13,"Here is the great bow belonging to Indra, an armour shining as fire, some arrows asbright as sun and a stainless auspicious spear."
6-102-14,"O heroic king! Mounting this chariot with me as a charioteer, kill Ravana the king,as earlier Indra the lord of celestials killed the demons."
6-102-15,"Duly circumambulating that chariot (as a mark of respect) and offering hissalutation, when thus spoken by Matali, Rama then ascended the chariot, causing the three worlds toshine forth with his splendour."
6-102-16,"Then ensued a tumultuous and thrilling battle, between the great armed Rama andRavana, the demon."
6-102-17,"That Rama, who was skilled in the use of great missiles, struck the missile presidedover by Gandharvas and the missile presided over by gods, by means of missiles of the sametype."
6-102-18,"Ravana, the king of demons was very much enraged and again released anotherextra-ordinarily terrific missile presided over by demons."
6-102-19,"Those arrows, decked with gold, discharged from Ravana's bow, turning as they wereinto highly poisonous snakes and rolled towards Rama."
6-102-20,"With flaming mouths wide open and vomiting blazing fire, those dreadful snake-likearrows dashed towards Rama alone."
6-102-21,"All the quarters stood covered by highly poisonous serpents, whose impact was ashard as that of Vasuki (the king of serpents), with the flaming coils. Even the corners between thequarters stood enveloped by them."
6-102-22,"Seeing those serpents rushing towards him in the battle-field, Rama released theterrific and dangerous missile presided over by Garuda the eagle (an enemy of serpents)."
6-102-23,"With golden shafts which shone like flames, discharged by Rama's bow turning intogolden eagles (the enemies of serpents) those arrows flew all around."
6-102-24,"Those arrows of Rama, which can assume any form at will, appeared in the form ofeagles and destroyed all those arrows, which flew with a great speed in the form of snakes."
6-102-25,"Enraged on his missile having been frustrated by Rama, Ravana streamed forthterrific showers of arrows on Rama."
6-102-26,"Tormenting Rama of unwearied action with thousand arrows, Ravana then pierced Mataliwith a multitude of arrows."
6-102-27,"Targeting with only one arrow, Ravana tore off the flag-staff. Striking down thegolden flag-staff from the top of the chariot down to the seat of the chariot, Ravana struck evenIndra's horses with a multitude of arrows."
6-102-28,"Seeing Rama afflicted, the gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Charanas thecelestials bards along with the demons, as also Siddhas the demi-gods and the great sages feltdejected. Seeing the moon in the shape of Rama eclipsed by Rahu in the shape of Ravana, themonkey-chiefs too, along with Vibhishana, felt perturbed."
6-102-29,"Seeing thus the moon in the shape of Rama eclipsed by the planet Rahu in the shapeof Ravana, the planet Mercury stood, assailing the constellation Rohini presided over by the godPrajapati (the lord of creation), the beloved of the moon the heavenly body and spelling disasterto all created beings."
6-102-30,"Blazing as it were in fury, the ocean rose high at that time, as though it was goingto touch the sun, its mist-wreathed waves moving to-and-fro."
6-102-31,"The sun, looking ashy in colour assuming a piercing aspect, and its rays grownexhilarated, appeared in a headless trunk in its lap and united with a comet."
6-102-32,"The planet Mars stood assailing in the sky, the constellation Vishakha, presidedover by the gods Indra and Agni (the god of fire), which is adorned by the kings of Kosala."
6-102-33,"That Ravana, having ten faces and twenty arms, holding a bow tightly in his hands,looked like Mount Mainaka."
6-102-34,"Being overwhelmed by Ravana the demon in the battle-front, Rama could not fit hisarrows to his bow."
6-102-35,"The enraged Rama, knitting his eye-brows and with his eyes turned slightlyblood-red, was provoked to fierce anger, as though he would burn out the demons."
6-102-36,"Seeing the face of the sagacious Rama getting provoked of anger, all the livingbeings got frightened. The earth too began to tremble."
6-102-37,"The mountain, with lions, tigers and swaying trees, was trembled. Even the ocean,the lord of rivers, became agitated."
6-102-38,"Dense clouds, emitting harsh sounds and assuming a stern aspect, roamed all over inthe sky, thundering."
6-102-39,"Seeing the very much enraged Rama and also the terrific portents, all the livingbeings were frightened. Fear seized Ravana too."
6-102-40,"Seated in their aerial cars, gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, great Nagas(semi divine beings having the face of a man and the tail of a serpent), the sages, demons, giantsand those eagles remaining in the air, saw then the battle of two heroes, fighting steadily withvarious dreadful weapons and looking like the final dissolution of the world."
6-102-41,"Getting rejoiced on observing that great battle, all the gods and demons who hadcome to witness the conflict at that time, responded:"
6-102-42,"The demons who reached there cried out to Ravana, ""Be victorious!"". Those godscalled to Rama saying again and again: ""Be you victorious!""."
6-102-43,"In the meantime, that evil-minded Ravana, who caused enemies to cry, stroking withanger a great weapon wishing to strike Rama, took hold off with fury, a spike, which was powerfulas a thunderbolt, which made a loud noise (when hurled at a target), capable of exterminating allenemies, resembling the mountain-peaks, which with its sharp points dreadful to conceive and tobehold, resembling a smoke-crested mass of fire blazing at the end of the world-cycle, exceedinglyfurious, which was difficult to approach even for Death, which was unassailable, which was a terrorfor all beings, capable as it was of tearing and splitting them and blazing as it was."
6-102-44,"That valiant Ravana, surrounded by warriors of demons in battle, was very muchenraged and took hold of that spear at its middle."
6-102-45,"With blood-red eyes in anger, Ravana with his collossal body, duly raising the spearand bringing rejoice to his own army, roared terribly in battle."
6-102-46,"The terrific noise made by Ravana then trembled the earth, the sky, the fourquarters and the angles of the compass"
6-102-47,"By that roar of that evil-minded Ravana of a collossal body, all the living beingswere frightened. The ocean too got agitated."
6-102-48,"Taking hold of that large spear, that Ravana of great prowess, emitting a very loudroar, spoke the following harsh words to Rama:"
6-102-49,"Raised in fury by me, O Rama! This spear with the power of a thunder-bolt, willtake away surely your life along with the life of your bother, your help-mate."
6-102-50,"Killing you with my strength now, I, who always commend war-fare, will make youlevel with the valiant demons, who have been killed in the battle-front."
6-102-51,"Wait, I will kill you with the spear now, O Rama! Saying so, that demon hurledthat spear."
6-102-52,"That spear, wreathed as it was in a circle of lightning, provided as it was witheight bells and making a loud noise, released from Ravana's hand, splashed, as it went into tehssky."
6-102-53,"Seeing that blazing spear of terrible appearance, the valiant Rama who was born inRaghu dynasty, having stretched his bow, released the arrows."
6-102-54,"With streams of arrows, Rama warded off that spear, which was rushing upon him, aswith streams of water, Indra the lord of celestials warded off the fire shooting up at the time ofdissolution of the world."
6-102-55,"That large spear of Ravana consumed those arrows coming forth from Rama's bow, asfire would consume the moths."
6-102-56,"Seeing those arrows smashed by coming into contact with the spear and reduced toashes even while positioned in the sky, Rama was seized with fury."
6-102-57,"That Rama, the delight of Raghus, was quite enraged and took hold of that spearbrought by Matali the charioteer, as desired by Indra the lord of celestials."
6-102-58,"That spear, lifted up by the powerful Rama, which was rendered resonated by thebells, began to blaze like a blazing meteor at the time of the dissolution of the world."
6-102-59,"That spear, hurled by Rama, fell on that Ravana's spear. Torn down by Rama's spear,the large spear of Ravana fell on the ground, with its lustre extinguished."
6-102-60,"With terrific arrows of high speed, with their shafts made of reeds, going straightto their target, Rama pierced the exceedingly fleet horses of Ravana."
6-102-61,"With his sharp arrows, Rama then pierced the chest-region of Ravana. He also struck,quite deliberately, the forehead of Ravana with three arrows."
6-102-62,"With all his limbs torn down by arrows and with blood flowing from his limbs, thatRavana in the midst of demons, shone like a blooming Ashoka tree in the midst of a multitude oftrees."
6-102-63,"With his limbs severely injured by Rama's arrows and with his body bathed in blood,that Ravana felt exhausted in the middle of a multitude of demons and gave went to a violent angerat that time."
6-103-1,"Tormented by Rama in fury, that Ravana then for his part, who was boasting of hisfight, flew into a great rage."
6-103-2,"Raising his bow, his eyes blazing with anger, extremely enraged as he was with Ramain that great battle, the valiant Ravana of prowess continued to oppress, by covering Rama withthousands of streams of arrows, as a rainy cloud would fill a pond with thousands of arrow-liketorrents from the sky."
6-103-3,"Covered by a multitude of arrows discharged from Ravana's bow in battle, Rama didnot wince, like a large mountain which was unshakable."
6-103-4,"The valiant Rama stood interrupting the torrents of arrows with his own arrows inthe battle-field and endured them as rays of the sun."
6-103-5,"Then, the enraged Ravana of brisk hand, struck thousands of arrows into the breastof the great-souled Rama."
6-103-6,"Rama, bathed in blood in the battle-field, appeared like a very big Kimshuka treewith bloom in a forest."
6-103-7,"Enraged at the impact of the arrows, that Rama of very great splendour , took holdof arrows which shone like the sun at the time of dissolution of the world."
6-103-8,"Both Rama and Ravana who were see each other at that time in the battle-field, whichwas shrouded in darkness by the arrows."
6-103-9,"Bursting into laughter, though filled with anger, the valiant Rama, the son ofDasaratha spoke the following harsh words to Ravana."
6-103-10,"O the worst of demons! Since you took away my helpless wife without my notice fromJanasthana, hence you are not a person of prowess."
6-103-11,"Having taken away by force the miserable Seetha while she was staying in the forestaway from me, you think: �I am a champion'."
6-103-12,"Having done an act of cowardly persons of laying your hands on another's wife,posing as a hero in relation to women without a protector, you think: I am a champion'."""
6-103-13,"O shameless person, who have broken the bounds of morality and are unstable ofcustoms, having laid hold through vanity of death (in the form of Seetha) you think �I am achampion'."
6-103-14,"Indeed a praiseworthy, great and glorious act has been performed by you, a valiantbrother of Kubera, the god of wealth, rich in strength!"
6-103-15,"Reap now and today the stupendous fruit of that noxious and contemptible act,perpetrated through sheer vanity."
6-103-16,"O evil-minded one! You think: �I am a champion' yourself! Shame did not stand inyour way at all, for having taken away Seetha like a thief."
6-103-17,"If Seetha were laid hands upon by you in my presence, you would have surely seenyour brother Khara at that very moment when killed with my arrows."
6-103-18,"Thank heaven, O stupid fellow, you have come within the range of my sight. I willdispatch you to the world of Death, by my sharp arrows, today."
6-103-19,"Let your head, having blazing ear-rings lying on the dust-laden battle-field, becarried away by beasts of prey, after being chopped off by my arrows today."
6-103-20,"O Ravana! Let vultures fly down on your wounded breast when you have been throwndown on the ground and oozing out from the orifices caused by the impact of my pointedarrow-tips."
6-103-21,"Let birds (such as crows and vultures) tear out your bowels, as eagles would dragserpents when you fall down dead when pierced by my arrows today."
6-103-22,"Thus speaking, the valiant Rama, the annihilator of enemies, poured out streams ofarrows on Ravana, who was in the vicinity."
6-103-23,"The prowess, the strength, the enthusiasm and the stamina of arms of Rama becametwo-fold, when he longed for the death of his enemy in battle."
6-103-24,"All kinds of mystic missiles came to light in the mind of Rama the learned self andin his excessive enthusiasm, Rama of extra-ordinary energy became all the more swift-handed."
6-103-25,"Recognizing those good omens, Rama, the destroyer of demons, tormented Ravana evenmore vehemently."
6-103-26,"While being struck by volleys of stones hurled by the monkeys and the showers ofarrows coming from Rama, Ravana felt bewildered at heart."
6-103-27,"Ravana could no longer take up weapons, nor stretch his bow, nor reacted to Rama'sprowess - on account of his mind being confused."
6-103-28,"As the time of his death approached, the arrows swiftly hurled and the various kindsof missiles employed by Ravana did not turn to be of any use in battle."
6-103-29,"Seeing Ravana reduced to such a plight, the charioteer driving the chariot, for hispart, without getting excited, calmly and slowly carried off his chariot away from thebattle-front."
6-103-30,"On seeing Ravana, the king sunk down; hopelessly bereft of energy, the charioteerdiverting in haste the chariot of Ravana, which was rumbling like a cloud, thereupon sneaked awayfrom the battle-field in dismay."
6-104-1,"Impelled by force of Destiny and with his red-blood eyes through anger due toinfatuation, that Ravana spoke to his charioteer as follows:"
6-104-2,"O evil-minded fellow! Despising me as though I were bereft of manliness, incapable,deficient in prowess, cowardly, petty-minded, devoid of energy, bereft of brilliance, deserted ofconjuring tricks and abandoned by mystic missiles, you are acting as per your discretion!"
6-104-3,"Why have you carried away this chariot of mine, thus humiliating me in the presenceof my enemies and overlooking my will?"
6-104-4,"O vulgar fellow! You have destroyed my fame which was earned through a long period,prowess, vital power and the trust of people today."
6-104-5,"While my adversary, having an illustrious prowess and making others delightfulthrough feats of his valour, stood looking on, myself, who has an ardent desire for fighting andwho was made contemptible by you!"
6-104-6,"O evil-minded fellow! In case you do not, by perversity, carry away this chariot atany event, this expectation of mine that you stand corrupted by the enemy, will be a fact."
6-104-7,"This act, which has been done by you, is only befitting of enemies. This is indeednot the work of a friend, who wishes me well."
6-104-8,"If you inhabited with me in Lanka for a long time and if you remember my merit,drive back the chariot swiftly till my enemy does not withdraw."
6-104-9,"Hearing those harsh words of the foolish Ravana, the friendly-minded charioteerspoke the following conciliatory words of Ravana:"
6-104-10,"I was neither frightened nor I was stupid. I was not bribed by the enemies, nor wasI a blunderer. I was not disloyal to you. I have not forgotten the benefits conferred by you."
6-104-11,"An act which was not to your taste was done by me as something conducive to yourinterest, by wishing well of you, for protecting your honour and with mind affectionately disposedtowards you through attachment."
6-104-12,"O monarch! Like somebody who is petty-minded and unworthy, you ought not to holdme, devoted as I am to your pleasure and good, quilty in this matter."
6-104-13,"O monarch! Like somebody who is petty-minded and unworthy, you ought not to holdme, devoted as I am to your pleasure and good, guilty in this matter."
6-104-14,"I understand your exhaustion, due to your strenuous fighting in the great battle. Iam not reflecting on the inclination of your valour or on your superiority over your enemy."
6-104-15,"The horses of my chariot were broken down and were exhausted by drawing thechariot. They became miserable and thoroughly fatigued, like the cows lashed by heavy rain."
6-104-16,"I am seeing inauspiciousness in all the portents, which appear to us in largenumbers and duly examined by me."
6-104-17,"(Propitious and unpropitious) time and place, (good and bad) omens, facial as alsothe strength and weakness of the warrior occupying the chariot must be ascertained (by acharioteer)."
6-104-18,"The eminences and depressions of the ground as well as the parts which are leveland rugged, the time appropriate for the combat and the visible weak points of the enemy must beknown (by a charioteer)."
6-104-19,"How to arrive and retreat, how to hold one's position and to recede all this mustbe known by a charioteer, seated in the chariot."
6-104-20,"This action appropriate was taken by me in order to give rest to you and to thesehorses of the chariot as also to relieve your terrible fatigue."
6-104-21,"O the valiant lord! This chariot was not removed by me arbitrarily. That which wasdone by me was because I was overwhelmed with affection for my master."
6-104-22,"O annihilator of enemies! O hero! Give me a command! I will do that which you willenjoin me to do, with due attention and with a mind which feels relieved of all that is due."
6-104-23,"Satisfied with the explanation given by his charioteer and applauding him in manyways, Ravana who was avaricious of fighting, spoke the following words:"
6-104-24,"O charioteer! Take this chariot quickly towards Rama. Ravana does not turn back inbattle, without killing his enemies."
6-104-25,"Thus speaking Ravna the lord of demons was pleased and then presented a beautifuland excellent ornament for the hand to him. That charioteer, after hearing Ravana's instruction,sdrove the chariot back to the battle-field."
6-104-26,"Impelled by Ravana's command, that charioteer thereupon quickly drove the horsesforward. Then, that chariot of Ravana stood within a moment, before Rama's chariot on thebattle-field."
6-105-1,"Approaching Rama standing absorbed in fight in the battle-field, exhausted as he wasby the fight, and seeing Ravana who came nearby, facing him duly prepared for the battle, theglorious sage, Agastya, who had come together with the gods, to perceive the battle, then spoke asfoolows:"
6-105-2,"O Rama, the mighty armed! Hear the following eternal secret, by which you canconquer all the enemies in battle, my child!"
6-105-3,"Worship the sun-god, the ruler of the worlds, who is crowned with the rays, whoappears at the horizon, who is greeted by the gods and the demons alike, shines forth; covering upall other lights and brings light to the world."

6-105-12,"He is the controller of all lunar mansions, planets and stars, the creator of alland the resplendent among the splendid. O god, appearing in twelve forms (in the shape of twelvemonths in a year), hail to you."
6-105-13,"Hail to you in the form of eastern mountain and hail to the western mountain. Hailto the lord of host of luminaries and hail to the lord of the day."
6-105-14,"Hail to you, the giver of victory, hail to you, the joy born of victory! Hail toyou, the god with green horses, hail to you, having thousands of rays! Hail, hail to you the son ofAditi!"

6-105-21,"He comprises all the gods, as well as the sacrifies as also the fruit of allsacrifices. He is a supremely competent one of all activities, which are found in all theworlds."
6-105-22,"O Rama! No individual glorifying this sun-god, in distresses in difficulties; inthe woods or in times of peril, comes to grief."
6-105-23,"Worship this sun-god, the lord of the universe and the god of all gods withundivided attention. Muttering this praise three times, you will come out victorious inbattles."
6-105-24,"You will be able to kill Ravana at this very moment, O mighty armed one! Sayingso, the sage, Agastya, thereupon, left as in the same way as he had come."
6-105-25,"Hearing this, Rama of extra ordinary energy, then became bereft of anguish. Feelinggreatly delighted, Rama retained that hymn in his memory with a devoted mind."
6-105-26,"Sipping the water thrice and getting purified looking intently on the orb of the sunand repeating this prayer, the valiant Rama obtained a great rejoice. Seizing hold of his bow andseeing Ravana, Rama felt delighted in mind and marched forward for the fight. He stood voed to killRavana, with an intense and all-sided effort."
6-105-27,"Seeing Rama with a delighted mind, and becoming most exhildrated on foreseeing thedeath of Ravana, the sun-god, standing in the middle of a troop of celestials, exclaimed, ""Hastenup."""
6-106-1,"Thrilling with rapture, that charioteer, the charioteer of Ravana, drove forwardquickly, his chariot, a chariot, which was capable of attacking the army of enemies, a wonderfulpiece of art like Gandharva-city, an imaginary city in the sky, mounted with flags, yoked withhorses of excellent quality adorned with golden necklaces, filled with war-implements, adorned withrows of flags and banners, which was devouring the sky as it were, making the earth resound, whichwas the destroyer of the army of adversaries and caused delight to its own."
6-106-2,"Rama saw that Ravana's chariot, which was coming speedily with a noise, bearing alarge flag-staff, yoked with black horses, endowed with a terrific luster, blazing like an aerialcar in the sky, with a luster of the sun, filled with lightning-like flags and with a beautifulappearance of a rain-bow."
6-106-3,"Seeing that chariot, releasing streams of arrows, like a cloud releasing streams ofrain, with a noise equal to that of a bursting mountain, struck with a diamond, Rama afterstretching his bow in a crescent shape, spoke to Matali, Indra's charioteer as follows:"
6-106-4,"O Matali! From the way in which the enemy is marching forward from left to rightwith a great speed in his chariot more, it appears that heart has been set by him upon destroyinghimself in the battle."
6-106-5,"Therefore, take care and march forward, facing the chariot of the enemy I wish todestroy it, even as the wind would blow a cloud."
6-106-6,"Without fear and flurry and with a steady heart and vision, and the movement of thereins fully controlled, drive the chariot swiftly."
6-106-7,"You need not be instructed by me, accustomed as you are to drive the chariot ofIndra the lord of celestials. Keen as I am to fight with a close attention, I am just reminding youand not teaching you."
6-106-8,"Extremely gratified with those words of Rama, that Matali the excellent charioteerof gods drove on the chariot."
6-106-9,"Passing the huge chariot of Ravana on the right, the charioteer then set Ravanashaking, by the dust risen from the wheels of his own chariot."
6-106-10,"The enraged Ravana then, with his coppery eyes wide open, trembled Rama, who stoodfacing his chariot, with arrows."
6-106-11,"Meeting fortitude with anger, though provoked with assault, Rama took hold ofIndra's bow, which was possessed of extra ordinary impulse in the battle-field."
6-106-12,"He also seized hold of arrows of exceeding swiftness, which were shining likesun-beams. Then began that great battle between the two warriors (Rama and Ravana) who weredesirous of killing each other, while facing each other like two proud lions."
6-106-13,"Then, the gods along with the Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Siddhas thedemigods and great sages, desirous of Ravana's ruin, arrived to see the battle of both thechariot-warrriors."
6-106-14,"Thereupon, terrific portents that caused one's hair to stand on end, appeared givingan augury of doom to Ravana and prosperity to Rama."
6-106-15,"The god of rains poured blood on Ravana's chariot. Horrible winds blew from right toleft, forming circles."
6-106-16,"A large flock of vultures, roaming about in the sky, was flying forward in the samedirection in which Ravana's chariot was going."
6-106-17,"Lanka was overcast with dusk, resembling a (red) Japa flower. The land in Lanka, asalso the day appeared as if they were blazing."
6-106-18,"Large meteors, along with lightnings fell with great noise. Those entities, inimicalto Ravana, made demons to lament."
6-106-19,"The earth on which Ravana was there, trembled. The arms of fighting demons looked asif they were clasped."
6-106-20,"Fallen before Ravana, the rays of the sun appeared coppery, yellow, white and dark,like mineral ores on a mountain."
6-106-21,"The she-jackals followed by vultures hastily uttered inauspicious howls, onbeholding Ravana's face as also vomiting fire from their mouths."
6-106-22,"Scattering the dust upwards over the battle-field and clouding the vision of thatRavana, the wind blew in a direction inimicable to him."
6-106-23,"Even without the appearance of clouds, thunderbolts fell on his army on all sides,with a noise which was hard to endure."
6-106-24,"All the quarters and intermediate points of the compass became covered with darknessand due to outpourings of dust, the sky became difficult to be seen."
6-106-25,"Hundreds of dreadful Sarika* birds, with their awful howls, terribly fighting there,fell down upon Ravana's chariot."
6-106-26,"His horses discharged sparks of fire from their hips and loins as also tears fromtheir eyes, releasing out fire and water at the same time continuously."
6-106-27,"Frightful portents in multitude thus sprang up, bringing danger and destruction toRavana."
6-106-28,"Pleasant and auspicious omens, depicting victory of Rama appeared on all sides,before Rama."
6-106-29,"Seeing the pleasant omens depicting his victory, Rama was very much pleased andconsidered Ravana as (already) dead."
6-106-30,"Then Rama, with the knowledge of all omens, having seen those portents in his ownway in the battle-field, obtained rejoice as well as extreme happiness and shown enhanced prowessin combat."
6-107-1,"Then ensued a fierce and a prolonged chariot-duel between Rama and Ravana, which wasfrightful to all the worlds."
6-107-2,"Then, the army of demons and the huge army of mokeys, stood motionless with theirweapons held fast in their hands."
6-107-3,"Having their hearts captivated in seeing those two warriors, a human being and ademon, both in full strength engaged in a fight, all for their part experienced a great wonder."
6-107-4,"Having their hands occupied with various kinds of weapons, all those warriors stoodamazed in mind in beholding that duel. They did not go for war on each other."
6-107-5,"The demons beholding Ravana and the army of monkeys seeing Rama with their eyes inamazement appeared as though they were paintings."
6-107-6,"Having made up their minds and being firm in their anger, those two warriors fortheir part, Rama and Ravana fought fearlessly, as it were, on seeing the portents in thebattle."
6-107-7,"Rama, who was convinced that he was going to win and Ravana who was firmly persuadedthat he would die, then demonstrated the entire wealth of their prowess in battle on thatoccasion."
6-107-8,"Thereupon, the valiant Ravana, fitting his arrows with anger, released them,directing them towards the flag-staff fixed on Rama's chariot."
6-107-9,"Without even reaching the ensign on Indra's chariot and touching off the staff whichsupported the banner of the chariot, the arrows fell on the ground."
6-107-10,"Thereafter, the valiant Rama too, in great anger, stretching his bow, proceeded withhis mind, to return blow for blow."
6-107-11,"Rama released a sharp arrow, looking like a huge serpent and which was unbearable,as though blazing with its own splendour, directing towards Ravana's flag-staff."
6-107-12,"As the brilliant Rama released the arrow towards the flag-staff, that arrow, tearingasunder Ravana's flag-staf, entered the earth."
6-107-13,"That standard, mounted on Ravana's chariot, having been torn off, fell on theground. Seeing the thrown-down piece of his flag-staff, that mighty Ravana stood blazing as thoughhe was laughing with intolerance. Flaming up with anger, he showered a stream of arrows afflictedas he was, with the power of wrath."
6-107-14,"Ravana struck Rama's horses with blazing arrows. Those divine horses were neithershaken nor stumbled in the battle-field. They were indeed healthy at heart and felt as though theywere just struck with lotus-stalks."
6-107-15,"Seeing those horses unstumbled, Ravana then was very much enraged and releasedshowers of arrows."
6-107-16,"He also hurled maces, iron bludgeons, discs, iron clubs, mountain-tops, trees,spikes and axes."
6-107-17,"Unwearied as he was in his heart and in effort, Ravana then employed streams ofmissiles as a creation of magic and also thousands of arrows."
6-107-18,"In that battle, abundant rain of various missiles, which were tumultuous, generatingfear, terrific and attended with a terrible echo, descended."
6-107-19,"Leaving alone Rama's chariot, Ravana released arrows on the army of monkeys on allsides, thus wholly covering the sky."
6-107-20,"Ravana released arrows with a mind, which had given up all hope of survival. Seeingthat Ravana, who was interested in the battle, putting forth his great effort, Rama fitted Sharparrows to his bow, as though laughing and thereupon he loosed the arrows in hundreds andthousands."
6-107-21,"Seeing those arrows, Ravana completely covered the sky with his own arrows. Due tothat dazzling shower of arrows then employed by the two warriors, the shining sky looked like asecond sky built with arrows."
6-107-22,"While Rama and Ravana were discharging the arrows thus in the battle0field, no arrowmissed the target, no one failed to pierce the target and none had gone in vain. Colliding witheach other, they fell on the ground."
6-107-23,"Releasing the arrows left and right continually, they fought at each other. Withtheir terrific arrows, they made the sky, bereft of even a breathing space."
6-107-24,"Rama struck Ravana's horses. Ravana struck Rama's horses. Both the warriors thenstruck at each other, doing anything before and after."
6-107-25,"Those two extremely enraged warriors in this way, carried out are excellent combat.A tumultuous battle ensued for an hour or so, causing the hair to stand erect."
6-107-26,"The mighty Ravana and Rama carried out the fight well with sharp arrows in thebattle-field. That Ravana at that time was very much enraged with Rama, as his flag-staff wasthrown down."
6-107-27,"All the created beings for their part gazed with an astonished mind on Rama andRavana, who thus were fighting at each other in the battle-field."
6-107-28,"Furiously attacking each other in the battle-field, those excellent chariots of thetwo warriors ran towards each other."
6-107-29,"Intent on destroying each other, those chariots, displaying various types ofmovements such as, moving in circles, moving straight and darting forward as also recedingforthwith, originated from the capabilities of those charioteers, assumed a terrible aspect."
6-107-30,"Rama wounding Ravana and Ravana too wounding Rama, both of them had recourse tospeed in movement in their forward and backward motions."
6-107-31,"Those excellent chariots, casting streams of arrows, strolled in the battle-field,like two clouds pouring showers."
6-107-32,"Showing various kinds of movement in the battle-field, those chariots then againstood facing each other."
6-107-33,"The shaft of the two chariots even as they stood at that moment, met one with theother shaft the muzzle of the horses met the one with the other and the flags met the one with theother flags."
6-107-34,"Then Rama, with his four sharp arrows discharged from his bow, drove back the foursplendid horses of Ravana."
6-107-35,"That Ravana, falling a prey to anger for retreating his horses, discharged sharparrows on Rama."
6-107-36,"Rama, who was severely struck by the mighty Ravana, did not get upset nor was eventottered."
6-107-37,"Directing towards Matali, Indra's charioteer, Ravana hurled arrows with a soundsimilar to that of a thunder-bolt."
6-107-38,"Arrows of great speed, fallen on Matali's body, did not cause even a pretty littleof bewilderment or hurt on him in that battle."
6-107-39,"Enraged at that daring attack on Matali, Rama who for his part did not feel provokedby the attack on himself, made his enemy turn away by hurling a net work of arrows on him."
6-107-40,"The valiant Rama discharged twenty, thirty, sixty and hundreds and thousands ofarrows on the enemy's chariot."
6-107-41,"Thereupon, even Ravana, the enraged king of demons, who was seated in the chariot,tormented Rama, by showering maces and mallets on him in the battle."
6-107-42,"The battle thus started again by then, was tumultuous, causing one's hair to standerect. With the sounds of maces, mallets and iron rods and with the gusts raised by the plumesadorning the flying arrows, the seven agitated oceans felt disquieted."
6-107-43,"Thousands of all the demons and serpents, inhabiting in the nethermost subterraneanregion of the agitated oceans, felt disturbed."
6-107-44,"The entire earth, including mountains, groves and forests trembled. The sun toobecame gloomy even the wind did not blow."
6-107-45,"Then, the gods along with Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Siddhas thesemi-divine beings, great sages and all including Kinnaras the mythical beings and great serpentsbecame disquieted."
6-107-46,"At that time, those gods along with troops of sages, saying ""May all be well withthe cows and Brahmanas, May all the worlds endure forever, May Rama conquer Ravana!"", saw aterrific battle between Rama and Ravana, which caused one's hair to stand on end."
6-107-47,"Seeing that matchless struggle and observing that the sky is its own compeer and theocean is its own analogue, the battle between Rama and Ravana can be likened only to the battlebetween Rama and Ravana, the hosts of Gandharvas the celestial musicians and Apsaras, the heavenlylymphs, looked on that battle between Rama and Ravana."
6-107-48,"Thereupon, the great-armed Rama who augmented the fame of the kings born in Raghudynasty, stretching with anger, the serpent-like arrow with his bow, chopped off the glorious headof Ravana, which was graced with blazing ear-rings. Then, all the three worlds saw that head,fallen on the ground."
6-107-49,"Another head, exactly similar to that head, cropped up on the shoulders of Ravana.That second head was again chopped off by Rama, possessing a swift hand and who was swift in hisact."
6-107-50,"The second head of Ravana was cut off by arrows in that battle. Soon after that headwas chopped off, it again rose into view."
6-107-51,"Rama chopped off that head too with his arrows looking like thunderbolts. In thesame manner, a hundred of Ravana's heads of equal splendour were chopped off by Rama."
6-107-52,"Yet, no certainty about Ravana's death could be seen. Thought equipped with manyarrows and well-versed with all kinds of missiles, the valiant Rama, the augmentor of Kausalya'sjoy, then became thoughtful (said to himself as follows):"
6-107-53,"What is the reason, these arrows by which Mareecha, Khara, Dushana, Kabandha inKroucha-forest, and Viradha in Dandaka-forest were killed, by which seven Sala trees and themountains were burst, by which Vali was killed and the ocean shaken up all these arrows whichprovided immediate succour to me in battle, have proved of little efficacy in the case ofRavana."
6-107-54,"Thus absorbed in thought, Rama remained vigilant in the battle-field. He showeredstreams of arrows in Ravana's chest."
6-107-55,"Thereupon, even Ravana, the enraged king of demons, who was seated in his chariot,tormented Rama by showering maces and mallets on him in the combat."
6-107-56,"That great tumultuous battle, which caused one's hair to stand on end, took place inthe sky, on the ground and furthermore on the mountain."
6-107-57,"While the gods, the demons, Yakshas the super-natural beings, the devils, theserpents and the ogres were witnessing, that great battle occurred for seven days."
6-107-58,"There was no respite in battle between Rama and Ravana, either in the might or inthe day-time or for an hour or even for a instant."
6-107-59,"Not beholding the victory of Rama in the combat between Rama and Ravana thatgreat-souled Matali, the charioteer of Indra quickly spoke the following words to Rama, who wasstill engaged in fighting."
6-108-1,"Thereupon, Matali refreshed the memory of Rama as follows: ""O the valiant one! Whyare you still carrying out the battle with Ravana as though you are unaware (of how to dispose ofhim)?"
6-108-2,"O lord! You can employ a mystic missile presided over by Brahma the lord ofcreation. The time for his destruction has come now, as expressed by the celestials."
6-108-3,"Then, the valiant Rama, who was reminded thus by Matali, took hold of a blazingarrow, which was given by Brahma and which in turn was given to him by the glorious sage, Agastyaearlier in the battle-field and which looked like a hissing serpent."
6-108-4,"Having been made formerly for Indra, the lord of celestials by Brahma, the lord ofcreation of infinite strength, it was bestowed in the past on the ruler of gods, who was desirousof conquering the three worlds."
6-108-5,"In its feathers, wind was established. In its end-point were the fire and the sun.In its heaviness were Mounts Meru and Mandara. Its shaft was made of ether."
6-108-6,"Provided with good shaft decked with gold, the arrow which had its body shining, hadbeen made up of the efficacy of all the elements and an illuminating power of the sun."
6-108-7,"Blazing like a fire at the time of universal dissolution enveloped in smoke andlooking like a venomous snake, it was swift in action and capable of bursting hosts of men,elephants and horses."
6-108-8,"It broke gate-ways, iron bars, and even mountains. Smeared witht he blood of variousvictims and quoted with their marrow, it presented a very terrific appearance."
6-108-9,"That arrow had an efficacy of a thunder bolt, loud-sounding, tearing off armies ofadversaries in many battles and creating fear to all, like a hissing serpent."
6-108-10,"It was giving perennial feed to vultures, eagles, cranes, troops of jackals anddemons in the battle-field, possessing a form of Yama the lord of Death and was fearful."
6-108-11,"That arrow bestowed joy on the monkey-leaders and destroyed the demons. It was madespeedy, by tying various kinds of beautiful coloured feathers of Garuda, the king of eagles, toit."
6-108-12,"Making it sacred by a special formula as per the procedure specified in scriptures,Rama who was endowed with an extraordinary strength then fixed that arrow which was the foremostamong the three worlds, capable of removing the fear of Ikshwaku dynasty, taking away the glory ofthe enemies and bestowing joy to one's own self on his bow."
6-108-13,"While that excellent arrow was being fixed by Rama, all the beings were frightenedand the earth trembled."
6-108-14,"That enraged Rama, stretching his bow well and with an attentive mind, hurled thatarrow which can tear off the vitals, towards Ravana."
6-108-15,"That arrow, which was inviolable as a thunderbolt hurled by the arms of Indra andirresistible as Yama the lord of Death, fell upon Ravana's chest."
6-108-16,"That arrow, released with great speed and which was capable of destroying the body,tore off the heart of that evil-minded Ravana."
6-108-17,"That arrow, which was capable of causing death to the body, after taking away thelife of Ravana and having been anointed with blood, penetrated the earth."
6-108-18,"Smeared with blood on having killed Ravana and thereby accomplishing its mission,that arrow re-entered its own quiver (of Rama) silently."
6-108-19,"From the hands of the slain Ravana, who was being separated from his life, fell hisbow with its arrows (fitted to it), at the same time coinciding indeed with his life-breath."
6-108-20,"Having lost his life, that king of demons for his part, who was endowed withterrible swiftness and invested with great splendour, fell down from the chariot to the ground ,like Vritra the demon when the latter was struck down by the thunderbolt."
6-108-21,"Seeing Ravana fallen down on earth, the surviving demons whose king had been killed,were panic stricken and ran away to all sides."
6-108-22,"The monkeys, who fought with trees, fell upon the demons from all sides. Seeing thekilling of Rvana, the monkeys assumed a triumphant appearance."
6-108-23,"Tormented by the monkeys, the demons rushed back with panic towards Lanka, withfaces looking miserable and tears flowing down, their supporter having been killed."
6-108-24,"Roaring shouts of joy, quite rejoiced as they were, and proclaiming Rama's victoryand the killing of Ravana in his hands, the monkeys behaved like conquerors."
6-108-25,"Then the cheerful kettle-drum of the gods reverberated in the sky. Very pleasantwinds, carrying divine odour, blew there."
6-108-26,"Pouring over the chariot of Rama quite fascinating shower of flowers, which wasdifficult to be accomplished (elsewhere), fell from the heavens to the earth on that occasion."
6-108-27,"Excellent pronouncements of the great-souled gods saying ""well done! Bravo!"",combined with a panegyric in praise of Rama, was distinctly heard in the sky."
6-108-28,"When Ravana, the cruel demon and the terror of all the worlds, was killed, a greatrejoice filled the hearts of gods and charanas the celestial bards."
6-108-29,"Having been pleased with the killing of Ravana, Rama then fulfilled the desire ofSugreeva, Angada and Vibhishana."
6-108-30,"Then, troops of celestials got their mental peace. All the quarters were brightenedup and the sky became clear. The earth did not tremble. The wind blew gently. The sun too shed asteady light."
6-108-31,"Rejoiced with the victory in battle, Sugreeva, Vibhishana and Angada together withLakshmana along with their friends paid their respects with due ceremony to Rama, who lookedcharming."
6-108-32,"That Rama, the delight of Dasaratha, for his part, who had just killed his enemy andthus who was steadfast in his vows and who was endowed with a great splendour, who stood surroundedon the battle-field by his own people and the army shone like Indra the lord of celestials."
6-109-1,"Seeing his brother lying down dead after defeat in battle, Vibhishana lamented, withhis mind filled with an outburst of sorrow:"
6-109-2,"Why are you lying killed on the ground, though you are highly worthy of turningtowards lofty beds, O hero! The valiant one, the celebrated one, prudent in polity?"
6-109-3,"Having thrown about your two long arms which though decked wit armlets, are nowmotionless and with your diadem brilliant as the sun, knocked down; why are you lying killed on theground/"
6-109-4,"O the valiant brother! That which was told by me earlier and that which was notliked by you, as you were overcome with sensuality and infatuation; that very fate has beenobtained by you."
6-109-5,"For that which, because of arrogance, neither Prahasta nor Indrajit and others, norKumbhakarna nor Atiratha nor Narantaka nor you yourself has agreed to my counsel, the consequenceof it has come now."
6-109-6,"As this hero, the foremost of those who wield the weapons, has fallen on theground, the established rule of well-conducted persons has gone. The incarnation of virtue hasdeparted. The epitome of strength has gone. The refuge of enlogies has gone out of sight. The sunhas fallen to the earth. The moon has merged in darkness. Fire has extinguished its flames and astrennous effort has become inactive."
6-109-7,"What is remaining in this world now, while Ravana the foremost of demons, is atpresent lying fast asleep in the dust?"
6-109-8,"With firmness for its shoot, endurance for its excellent blossom, asceticism forits strength, and valour for its firm root, the large tree in the shape of Ravana has been crushedin the battle-field, by the tempest in the shape of Rama."
6-109-9,"With sharpness for its tusks, the line of ancestors for its back-bone, anger forits lower parts and graciousness for its proboscis, the elephant in rut in the shape of Ravana islying asleep on the ground, its body having been overthrown by a lion in the shape of Rama."
6-109-10,"With prowess and power for its expanded flames, sighs for its smoke and his nativestrength for its glowing heat, the blazing fire in the shape of Ravana the demon has beenextingushed in the battle-field by the rainy cloud in the shape of Rama."
6-109-11,"With the demons for its tail; hump and horn and fickleness for its ears and eyes,the bull in the shape of Ravana the demon, the conqueror of its enemies, which vied with the windin energy, is lying dead, struck down by a tiger in the shape of Rama, the ruler of the earth."
6-109-12,"To Vibhishana, who was thus speaking; enveloped in sorrow, Rama spoke the followingwords, full of reason and which revealed his determined view of the matter."
6-109-13,"Ravana did not die in battle, without making an effort. He has fallen in combat,eventhough he was endowed with terrible prowess and exhibited extra ordinary enthusiasm of a veryexalted type and remained confident throughout."
6-109-14,"There is no occasion to grieve for him having fallen into death in the battle-fieldand by whom the development of his country was wished for, while remaining steadfast in the duty ofKshatriya the warrior."
6-109-15,"There is no occasion to grieve for his having been brought under the sway of deathby whom intelligent as he was, all the three worlds including indra were frightened."
6-109-16,"In the past, none has ever been exclusively victorious in a combat. A hero eitherhas been killed by his adversaries or had killed the enemies in battle."
6-109-17,"Such is the destiny proclaimed by the ancients, as highly esteemed for a warrior. Awarrior killed in battle, does not deserve to be mourned. Such is the ascertainment of the sacredscriptures."
6-109-18,"Therefore, seeing this ascertainment, understanding the true principle, and freefrom grief, think here of what duty that deserves to be performed."
6-109-19,"To that valiant prince (Rama) by whom the aforesaid words were spoken, Vibhishana,who was tormented with grief, spoke (as follows) about the suitable action to be done next inrelation to his brother."
6-109-20,"The demon, who had never been conquered before in battles, by even all the godscombined or by Indra himself, has been conquered, on confronting you in the battle-field, as thesea breaks up, on reaching the shore."
6-109-21,"By him, gifts were endowed to to mendicents. Pleasures too were enjoyed. The king'sservents were fully maintained. Rches were made over to friends. Grudges against enemiies wererevenged."
6-109-22,"He maintained a perpetually sacred fire. he practised great religious austerities.He completely mastered Vedas, the sacred scriptures. He was highly proficient even in the ritualacts. I desire to do, with you graciousness, that which is to be performed to him, who has departedto the other world."
6-109-23,"Thus getting the personality of Ravana well-acquainted by vibhishana by hiscompassionate words, Rama possessing unimpaired goodness, directed Vibhishana to perfom funeralrites, which were intended to lead the departed soul to heaven:"
6-109-24,"Hostilities end with death. Our purpose has been accomplished. Let his funeralrites be performed. He is even as good mine, as yours."
6-110-1,"Seeing Ravana killed by the great-souled Rama, the female-demons were stricken withgrief and rushed out from their gynaecium."
6-110-2,"Even though impeded now and then by their maid servants, they were rolling in thedust of the streets, with their hair dishevelled, tormented as they were with grief like cows thathad lost their calf."
6-110-3,"Issuing out of the northern gate along with demons and penetrating into the terrificbattle-field, searching for their husband, who had been killed and crying out, ""Ah my lord! Ah myhusband!"" they all ran hither and thither on the ground which was covered with headless trunks andrendered muddy with blood."""
6-110-4,"Those women, who were overcome with grief about the death of their husband, havingtheir eyes filled with tears, loudly lamented like female-elephants who had lost the leader oftheir herd."
6-110-5,"Those women saw the gigantic Ravana, who was endowed with a great strength andinvested with a great splendour, lying killed on the ground, like a heap of black collyrium."
6-110-6,"Suddenly seeing their husband lying in dust of the battle-field, those women felldown on his limbs, like uprooted wild creepers."
6-110-7,"A woman wept, embracing him out of great regard, another woman clinging to his feetand another, catching hold of his neck."
6-110-8,"A woman rolled over the ground, with her arms thrown up. On seeing the face of herdeceased husband, another woman fell into a swoon."
6-110-9,"Keeping Ravana's head in her lap, a woman, looking at his face, wept moistening thatface with her tears, as dew drops moisten a lotus-flower."
6-110-10,"That Ravana, by whom Indra was thrown into fear, Yama was struck with terror, bywhom Kubera the king was deprived of Pushpaka the aerial car, and by whom fear was caused on thebattle-field in the Gandharva the celestial musicians, in the sages and the great-souled gods, lieskilled in the battle-field."
6-110-11,"This danger has come from a mortal to him, who did not conceive any fear from thedemons or the gods or even the serpents for that matter!"
6-110-12,"Here lies killed in battle, by a pedestrian man coming from Ayodhya, that Ravana,who was incapable of being killed by gods and even so by devils and demons too."
6-110-13,"He who could not be killed by gods, Yakshas and demons alike, could be killed by amortal like one devoid of strength."
6-110-14,"Thus uttering, those women of Ravana, wailing as aforesaid, burst into tears. Theyonce more and repeatedly lamented, stricken, as they were, with grief (as follows):"
6-110-15,"For your own death, Seetha was borne away by you, who did not listen to your nearand dear ones, who always offered friendly counsel to you. The demons were struck down. Here, standwe (your consorts) as well as your own self, struck down now."
6-110-16,"Though tendering salutary advice to you, Vibhishana your beloved brother, washarshly scolded through ignorance by you, who sought your own destruction."
6-110-17,"If you had restored Seetha a princess of Mithila to Rama, this appallingly terrificdisaster, which has robbed us of every root, would not have befallen us."
6-110-18,"If you had restored Seetha to Rama, Vibhishana your brother would have had hisdesire fulfilled. Rama would have been in the company of our allies. All of us would have beenspared the curse of widowhood and our enemies would not have realized their ambition."
6-110-19,"By you, however, who forcefully captivated Seetha cruelly, the demons, we (yourconsorts) and your own self all the three have been destroyed all at once."
6-110-20,"O the excellent demon! Your act of following your own free will, may not be thereason for your destruction, either for, all is being run by a divine power, struck and ruined bythe divine power."
6-110-21,"This destruction of the monkeys, your demons as also yourself, in the battle, hashappened at the juncture of the Providence (alone), O the great armed!"
6-110-22,"The course of destiny, when ready to bear fruit, cannot be diverted either bymoney, or by wish, or by valour or even by command in this world."
6-110-23,"Those consorts of Ravana, depressed as they were and afflicted with grief, withtheir eyes full of tears, thus lamented like female ospreys."
6-111-1,"While those consorts were weeping on that occasion, Mandodari, the senior most andbeloved wife of Ravana, who was feeling miserable, stared at her husband."
6-111-2,"Gazing at Ravana, her husband who was killed by Rama of unimaginable exploits,Mandodari there, miserably lamented (as follows):"
6-111-3,"O the great armed, the brother of Kubera! Even Indra the destroyer of strongholds,indeed dares not to stand before you, when you were enraged."
6-111-4,"Because of fear from you, eminent sages, illustrious Gandharvas the celestialmusicians and the wandering bards indeed fled in all directions."
6-111-5,"O the lord of demons! O king! How is it that you are not ashamed, though you wereconquered in battle, by Rama, a mere mortal?"
6-111-6,"How did a mortal, wandering in a forest, killed you, who having overcome the threeworlds by dint of your prowess, had grown irresistible and were endowed with glory?"
6-111-7,"It is not possible of annihilation of yourself, who lived in a place not accessibleto men and was able to assume any form at your will, by Rama in battle."
6-111-8,"I do not believe this act of Rama in the battle-front, nor do I believe of theattack by him, on your army, fully equipped with all the implements of war."
6-111-9,"The moment your brother Khara was killed by Rama in Janasthana, though surroundedby a multitude of demons, it became evident that Rama was really no mortal."
6-111-10,"We felt painful, the moment Hanuma penetrated, by dint of his prowess, deep intothe City of Lanka, which was difficult to be entered even for gods."
6-111-11,"The day when the terrific monkeys built a bridge on the great ocean, that dayitself I believed that Rama was not an ordinary mortal."
6-111-12,"Otherwise, for your destruction, Yama, the lord of Death came himself assuming theform of Rama having arranged an unimaginable form of illusion."
6-111-13,"O the mighty lord! Otherwise, you might have been overpowered by Indra the lord ofcelestials. But for Indra, where is the capacity even to behold you in battle?"
6-111-14,"This Rama is certainly a great ascetic, an eternal person, having no beginningmiddle or end, greater than distinguished universal spirit like Brahma, the one beyond ignorance,the nourisher, wielding a conch, a disc and a mace, wearing the 'Srivatsa' mark on his chest, oflasting beauty, incapable of being conquered, a perpetual one, being the constant soul of theuniverse, truly mighty, the lord of all the worlds, the prosperous one having a great splendour andVishnu, the lord of maintenance of the world with a wish to benefit the worlds, assuming a humanform surrounded by all the gods in the form of monkeys, Rama killed you, surrounded by demons."
6-111-15,"In the past, by performing a great penance, you conquered the senses and conqueredthe three worlds. Now, as if revenging that enmity, those very senses conquered you."
6-111-16,"The moment your brother Khara was killed by Rama in Janasthana, though surroundedby a multitude of demons, it became evident that Rama was really no mortal. We felt perturbed, themoment Hanuma penetrated, by dint of his prowess, deeply into the City of Lanka, which wasdifficult to be entered even for gods."
6-111-17,"This evil result has come upon you, since you did not heed to my advice, sayingthat no hostility should be entered into with Rama."
6-111-18,"O the foremost of demons! For the annihilation of your power, your body and yourown people, you conceived a desire for Seetha suddenly."
6-111-19,"O the foolish one! An unworthy act was indeed done by you, in offending Seetha, whowas more distinguished and more respectable than Arundhati (wife of sage Vasishta) and Rohini (theprincipal spouse of moon-god)."
6-111-20,"O my lord, who annihilated yourself and your people! Seetha is the model offorbearance even to the Goddess Earth and a model of grace to Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune andcharm. She is extremely fond of her husband. By a recourse to a fraud in bringing that Seetha in alonely forest, faultless in every limb as she was, and charming though miserable, and having failedto fulfill your desire for union with Seetha and due to your own fault you have been surelyconsumed by the asceticism of that woman, devoted as she was to her husband."
6-111-21,"It is because, the gods together with Indra the ruler of gods including thoseheaded by the fire-god fear you, that you were not consumed even while you were laying hands onSeetha, the slender-waisted woman."
6-111-22,"There is no doubt that when the time comes, the doer surely reaps a harsh fruit ofhis sinful deed."
6-111-23,"The doer of an auspicious act obtains happiness, while the doer of a sinful actreaps misery. While Vibhishana has obtained happiness, you met with such an evil destiny."
6-111-24,"There are other women, more excellent in form than Seetha for you in yourgynaecium. Having fallen a prey to the power of passion, you did not know it throughignorance."
6-111-25,"Seetha is no match for me either in birth or in beauty or in amiability. You didnot perceive this through infatuation."
6-111-26,"At any time, there is no causeless death for any living being. As for you, thisSeetha has become a cause."
6-111-27,"Death which was brought about on account of Seetha was invited by you from afar-off distance. Free from sorrow, Seetha will now be enjoying herself with Rama."
6-111-28,"I, however, whose stock of merit was deficient, have fallen into a terrific oceanof grief. I, who having enjoyed myself with you in suitable aerial cars in Mount Kailasa, mountMandara, Mount Meru and in a grove named Chaitraratha and in all celestial gardens, decked as waswith lovely garlands and clad in colorful robes and invested in matchless splendour, visiting andseeing various lands of every description have now been deprived of all sense- enjoyments becauseof your death. Though the same, I stand transformed into another as it were. Woe be to theflickering fortunes of kings!"
6-111-29,"Alas, O king! That face of yours which was so tender, O lord, and distinguished bycharming eye-brows, a gloss surface, having an exceptionally prominent nose, coppery lips andbrilliant ear-rings, which vied with the moon the lotus and the sun in loveliness, light andluster, was illumined by a number of diadems, which shone with its eyes wild and rolling throughinebriety in banqueting places, bore garlands of various kinds, was lovely and charming in everyway, was lit with a captivating smile and indulged in a delightful talk - that face of yours doesnot actually shine as before today pierced with Rama's arrows, it lies dyed with streams of blood.It has its marrow shattered and has got soiled through the dust raised by the chariots."
6-111-30,"Alas! The last stage of my life, which conferred widow ship on me, has come andwhich was never contemplated me at any time; a stupid woman as I am."
6-111-31,"I was very much proud that my father was king of demons, my husband a lord ofdemons and my son, a conqueror of Indra the lord of celestials."
6-111-32,"I had a firm conviction that my guardians were capable of crushing their arrogantadversaries, heroes as they were, renowned for their might and valour, and as such had no fear fromany quarter."
6-111-33,"How did this unknown danger come from a mortal to you, who were so powerful?"
6-111-34,"O king! The body of yours which was really dark as glossy sapphire, gigantic like alofty mountain and resplendent with Keyuras and Angadas (two varieties of armlets) and necklace ofcat's eye-gems and pearls and wreaths of flowers, which body looked more charming during yourpleasure-walks and dazzling in battle-fields, which shone with luster of jewels as a rainy cloudwith flashes of lightning lies transfixed in numerous sharp arrows today. Though it will bedifficult for me to touch it again, it is no longer possible to embrace it. It has tendons cut topieces, by arrows of Rama, dug deep into your vital parts and closely transfixed like the spines ofa porcupine. Though dark of complexion, it is now transformed into the colour of blood and liesfallen on the ground like a mountain broken into pieces when hit by a stroke of thunder-bolt."
6-111-35,"Alas! Is it a dream? Is it the reality? But, how could you be killed by Rama? Youwere the death, even to Death himself. How did you depart from this world, falling under the swayof Death?"
6-111-36,"My husband enjoyed the wealth of all the three worlds. He gave tremendous fear tothe three worlds. He conquered the guardians of the worlds and lifted up Lord Shiva (along with hisseat, Mount Kailasa)."
6-111-37,"My husband held down those who were arrogant. He manifested his prowess and shookup the worlds. He caused the living beings to weep, with his roars."
6-111-38,"He used to utter arrogant words with vigour in the presence of his enemies. He wasthe protector for his troop and his servants. He was the killer of those who indulged in terribleacts."
6-111-39,"He was the killer of the lords of demons and Yakshas the super natural beings inthousands. He was drawing to himself, the demons called Nivatakavachas, in battles."
6-111-40,"My husband ruined several sacrificial performances. He was the protector of his ownpeople. He violated the moral order. He violated the moral order. He created conjuring tricks onthe battle-field."
6-111-41,"He used to bring the virgin-daughters of gods, demons and human beings from hereand there. He brought mourning to his enemy's wives. He was the leader of his own people."
6-111-42,"He was the protector of the island of Lanka. He was the doer of terrible deeds. Hewas the bestower of desires and sensual gratifications to us. He was excellent among thechariot-warriors."
6-111-43,"Seeing my husband with such power struck down by Rama, I, having my husband killed,am hard-hearted indeed, still bearing this body."
6-111-44,"Having reposed on very valuable coaches, O the king of demons, why are you lyingburied in sleep slumber on the bare ground and shrouded in dust?"
6-111-45,"When Indrajit, your son was killed in battle by Lakshmana, I was hard-hit then andtoday, of course, I am completely beaten down."
6-111-46,"Bereft of kinsfolk and forsaken by you, my lord, and deprived of desires andsensual enjoyments, I shall lament for ever more years."
6-111-47,"O king! Having embarked today on a long journey, which is very difficult to betraversed, take me too with you, tormented as I am with grief. I shall not survive withoutyou."
6-111-48,"Why do you intend to go, leaving me here, miserable as I am? Why do you not speakto me, a sad and lamenting creature, and unfortunate as I am?"
6-111-49,"O Lord! Are you not indeed enraged, in seeing me on foot in this way out throughthe city-gate, unveiled and come on foot in the way?"
6-111-50,"O lover of your consorts! Look at all your spouses, who came out, with their veilsdropped off. Why are you not getting enraged in seeing this?"
6-111-51,"This Mandodari, who was helping in your sport with you, is weeping withhelplessness. You are not consoling her. Do you not have a high esteem of her?"
6-111-52,"You have fallen under the sway of your enemies in that you were cursed by thenumerous women of noble lineage, who, though devoted to their husband, fond of piety and intent onthe service of their elders, had been widowed by you, O king, and were accordingly tormented withgrief. That curse which was pronounced at that time by those aggrieved women on their having beenwronged by you, has fallen on you."
6-111-53,"The popular saying that the tears of virtuous wives d not generally fall on theground in vain' has come out probably true in your case O king!"
6-111-54,"How was this mean act of abducting a lady, done by you, who having invaded thethree worlds, were proud f your prowess?"
6-111-55,"It was indeed a mark of your cowardice that Rama's consort was borne away by you,after luring away Rama from his hermitage in the pretext of deer"
6-111-56,"I do not recall your faint-heartedness at any time on the battle-field. That caseof abduction of Seetha, however, was due to your ill-luck and certainly as the result of yoursins."
6-111-57,"O the mighty armed one! Whatever my younger brother-in-law, Vibhishana who knowsmatters relating to the pat and of the future and also conversant with the present said afterreflecting and sighing for long, on seeing Seetha abducted by you: 'The destruction of the chiefsamong the demons now is imminent, have become true words. This misfortune had come from the lust,wrath and addiction to the vice of deep attachment."
6-111-58,"This major disaster occurred, destroying our very root, because of you. This entirerace of demons has been deprived of its protector, by you."
6-111-59,"You, who were far illustrious for your strength and prowess, do not deserve to belamented for by me. But, because of feminine nature, my mind is leaning towards melancholy."
6-111-60,"By taking away your merit and sin, you obtained your course of fate. I, however,mourn for my own self, so afflicted as I am, by your death."
6-111-61,"O Ravana! You did not hear the advice of your friends, who wish for your welfare.Nor did you hear the words of your brothers completely."
6-111-62,"The counsel offered by Vibhishana, which was endowed with reason, meaning, rule ofconduct, wholesome, gentle and well-founded, was not implemented by you."
6-111-63,"The advices offered by Mareecha, Kumbhakarna, myself and my father have not beenheeded by you, who were arrogant of your prowess. What is followed is a bitter consequence of yourperversity."
6-111-64,"My lord, resembling a dark cloud in hue, clad in yellow and decked with brilliantarmlets, why are you lying with your limbs, cast away on the ground and bathed in blood?"
6-111-65,"As though fast asleep, why are you not replying to me, the granddaughter of Somalithe demon who was clever, endowed with extraordinary prowess and never retreated in battles,tormented with grief as I am?"
6-111-66,"Arise, arise! Why are you lying down, though subjected to a fresh insult? The sun'srays have penetrated deep into Lanka today, without any fear."
6-111-67,"Torn into thousand pieces, that iron bludgeon of yours, which was brilliant as thesun, like a thunderbolt of Indra, with which you killed your enemies in the battle-field, which wasconstantly honoured by you, which had struck many in battle and which was decked with gold, liesscattered."
6-111-68,"Why are you lying down, embracing the battle-ground, as one would embrace a lovedone? Why do you not feel inclined to reply to me, as though I were abhorrent to you?"""
6-111-69,"Woe be to me, that my heart is not bursting into pieces, tormented as I am withgrief, now that you have returned to the five elements."
6-111-70,"Lamenting thus, with her eyes filled with tears and her heart moistened with love,Mandodari, at that time, fell into a swoon."
6-111-71,"Fallen on the breast of Ravana, that dispirited Mandodari, stricken as she was withgrief, shone like a vivid flash of lightning across a rainy cloud, reddened by the flow oftwilight."
6-111-72,"Raising up Mandodari, who was in that condition bitterly weeping, her co-wives whowere also weeping, very much distressed as they were, began to console her (as follows):"
6-111-73,"Don't you know the uncertain state of the worlds, O queen, that the wealth of kingsis unsteady, when there is a change in the tide of their fate?"
6-111-74,"While they were consoling thus, Mandodari, moistening her breasts and her spotlessface in tears, wept aloud at that moment."
6-111-75,"In the meanwhile, Rama spoke to Vibhishana as follows: ""Let the obsequies of yourbrother be performed and let these crews of women be consoled."""
6-111-76,"Reflecting with his intellect, the intelligent Vibhishana, the knower of virtue,thereupon, spoke to Rama, the following words, which were in conformity with righteousness andself-interest."
6-111-77,"I am not obliged to perform the obsequies to him, who had abandoned the vow ofvirtue, who was cruel, who killed human beings, who was a cheater and who had longed for others'wives."
6-111-78,"This Ravana, who was interested in wishing evil to all, though venerable as arespectable elder, is not fit for honour. He is my enemy, in the guise of a brother."
6-111-79,"If I do not perform obsequies, O Rama, the human beings on earth will speak aboutme as ruthless. But, on hearing about his bad qualities all of them will speak of it as a goodact."
6-111-80,"Hearing those words, Rama the best among the supporters of virtue and skilled inspeech, was very much pleased and spoke the following words to Vibhishana, the intelligent one inhis speech."
6-111-81,"O king of demons! I too have to do a favour to you. I won the battle because ofyou. Certainly I have to give you an appropriate advice."
6-111-82,"This demon may be full of unrighteousness and falsehood. But, he was brilliant,strong and ever a brave warrior in battles."
6-111-83,"It is heard that Ravana who was mighty, endowed with strength and who was causingpeople to cry, was not conquered by the chiefs like Indra and others."
6-111-84,"Hostilities end with death. Our purpose has been accomplished. Let his funeralrites be performed. He is even as good mine also, as yours."
6-111-85,"According to rule, Ravana is eligible to get the last rites on his dead body fromyou, by usage. You will also become fit for glory."
6-111-86,"Having heard the words of Rama, Vibhishana in haste began to do obsequies to Ravana,his dead brother."
6-111-87,"Entering the City of Lanka, that Vibhishana, the lord of demons, quickly concludedthe Agnihotra (the act of pouring oblations into the sacred fire) carried on by Ravana."
6-111-88,"Vibhishana actually caused to be brought together, carts, excellent varieties offirewood, the three sacred fires and the priests required to officiate at the obsequies, logs ofsandalwood, various types of firewood, pieces of fragrant aloe-wood, odorous perfumes, as well asgems, pearls and corals."
6-111-89,"Surrounded with demons, he came back for a while and thereupon, Vibhishana alongwith malyavan (the father of his own mother) initiated the obsequies."
6-111-90,"Placing Ravana, the lord of demons, who was covered with linen, accompanied byblasts of various musical instruments as well as panegyrists singing his the Brahmanas (formingpart of the demon's race, which was apparently divided into four classes, like human beings) stoodaround him with their faces filled in tears. Lifting up that palanquin, which had been decoratedwith colorful flags and flowers and taking up blocks of wood, all the demons for their part, withVibhishana in front, proceeded with their face turned towards the south."
6-111-91,"Those sacrificial fires were ignited and re-animated, as they were, by Adhvaryupriests, the performers of the sacrificial act, at that time. Those sacrificial fires werecontained in earthen pots and went in front of Ravana's body."
6-111-92,"All those women of the gynaecium, while weeping, followed at his heels with quickpaces, stumbling, as they were, on all sides."
6-111-93,"Keeping the body of Ravana on a consecrated spot, Vibhishana and others, who werevery much afflicted with grief, piled up a sacred pyre, with logs of sandalwood, moistened withperfumes called Padmaka and Koshira and covered with the skin of black antelopes, turned about toperform the obsequies in accordance with Vedic rites in honour of the king."
6-111-94,"They performed the ancestral oblations to Ravana in a superb way. They constructedan altar in the south-east the funeral pile) and placed the sacred fire in its proper place."
6-111-95,"They poured a ladle-full of ghee mixed with curds on his shoulders, placed a cart athis feet and then a wooden mortar at his thighs."
6-111-96,"Having set at their proper place, all the wooden vessels (used in Agnihotra), thelower piece of wood used for kindling fire at a sacrifice and the upper piece of wood (which isrotated at great speed on to lower one, to produce fire by friction), the wooden pestle and otherthings used in the sacrifice, they circled around the funeral pyre."
6-111-97,"According to ordinance laid down by eminent sages and according to the rules viewedin Vedas, having sacrificed a goat fit for sacrifice at that spot, the demons dampened with ghee onRavana the King of demons."
6-111-98,"Having decorated the body of Ravana with perfumes, garlands and various kinds ofclothes; those demons accompanied by Vibhishana, distressed as they were in their minds, pouredparched grains of rice, with their faces bathed in tears."
6-111-99,"That Vibhishana set fire to Ravana, according to the rules in the scriptures.Washing himself and offering in his wet clothes, according to scriptural ordinance, sesame seedsmixed with water, as well as blades of Kusha grass and offering obeisance to Ravana by bowing hishead, Vibhishana entreated those women to return, consoling them again and again. Then, all of thereturned to the City."
6-111-100,"When those women were re-entering the City, Vibhishana the lord of demons onapproaching Rama's vicinity then remained standing there with humility."
6-111-101,"Having destroyed the enemy, Rama too experienced happiness, along with his army aswell as with Sugreeva and Lakshmana, even as Indra the wielder of thunderbolt did on destroyingVritra the demon."
6-111-102,"Thereupon, taking off his bow and arrows as also that great armour endowed to him byIndra, Rama the annihilator of his enemies, taking off his anger too, because of the enemy'sdefeat, then obtained a charming benevolence."
6-112-1,"Having seen the destruction of Ravana, those gods, celestial musicians and demons,while chatting about the auspicious narrative, went away in their respective aerial cars."
6-112-2,"Chatting themselves about the awful destruction of Ravana, the terrific prowess ofRama, the admirable combat of the monkeys, the counsel tendered by Sugreeva, the affection andvalour of Lakshmana; the son of Sumitra; the loyaltyof Seetha to her husband and about the strengthof Hanuma, the illustrious celestials and others rejoicingly returned as they had come."
6-112-3,"Taking leave of the celestial chariot, which had been given by Indra the lord ofcelestials and which shone like fire, the mighty armed Rama respectfully saluted Matali."
6-112-4,"As assented by Rama, Matali Indra's charioteer, mounting that celestial chariot,ascended to the heaven itself."
6-112-5,"When Matali ascended to heaven along with his chariot, Rama, the foremost one amongthe chariot-warriors was highly rejoiced and embraced Sugreeva."
6-112-6,"Having embraced Sugreeva greeted by Lakshmana and having been honoured by themonkey-troops. Rama came to the camp where the army had been stationed."
6-112-7,"Then, Rama spoke (as follows) to Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, who was endowed withstrength and having auspicious marks, who stayed nearby."
6-112-8,"O the benevolent Lakshmana! Consecrate on the throne of Lanka, this Vibhishana towhom everyone is attached, a loyal person as he is and the one who has formerly done a service tous."
6-112-9,"O gentle one! This s my paramount desire that I should see this Vibhishana, thebrother of Ravana being consecrated for throne in Lanka."
6-112-10,"Hearing the words of the great soled Rama, Lakshmana replied, 'so it be' andrejoicingly procured a golden pot."
6-112-11,"That mighty Lakshmana, then placing that pot in the hands of the monkey-chiefs,instructed them, who were as swift as thought, to bring sea-water."
6-112-12,"Thereupon, those excellent monkeys, with the swiftness of thought, moving veryquickly from that place, returned, having obtained the water from the sea."
6-112-13,"Thereupon, Lakshmana together with his friends, taking one pot and making Vibhishanato sit on the throne, sprinkled him with sea-water from that pot in accordance with the ruleprescribed in Vedic scriptures, while the demons were witnessing the ceremony, to make him the kingfor Lanka, as directed by Rama."
6-112-14,"Then, all the demons as well as the monkeys consecrated Vibhishana. Having gainedextra ordinary delight, they indeed eulogized Rama."
6-112-15,"Seeing Vibhishana the lord of demons consecrated for the throne of Lanka, his fourcounsellors who were always together with him and such of those demons who were devoted to him,were rejoiced."
6-112-16,"Rama together with Lakshmana were greatly delighted. That Vibhishana, having gainedthat great kingdom bestowed on him by Rama, was also greatly delighted."
6-112-17,"After consoling his people, Vibhishana then sought to presence of Rama. Now, thedemons who were residing in the city were quite delighted and brought to him (by way of presents)curds, unbroken grains of rice, sweets shaped like balls, parched grains of unhusked rice andflowers too."
6-112-18,"Accepting them, the valiant and unconquerable Vibhishana happily offered all thoseauspicious objects to Rama and Lakshmana."
6-112-19,"Seeing Vibhishana, who had accomplished his act and increased his resources, Ramaaccepted it all, with a sole desire to show gratefulness to him."
6-112-20,"Thereupon, Rama spoke the following words to the valiant Hanuma the monkey who wasequal in size to a mountain and who was standing in humility, with his hands joined insalutation."
6-112-21,"O the benevolent one! Taking permission from this Vibhishana, the great king andentering into the City of Lanka, inform about our welfare to Seetha."
6-112-22,"O Hanuma, the proficient one in speech! Inform Seetha that myself together withLakshmana and Sugreeva are well and that Ravana had been killed in battle."
6-112-23,"O Hanuma the master of monkeys! Making clear this favourite news to Seetha, youought to return, taking back her message."
6-113-1,"Thus directed by Rama, Hanuma the son of wind-god, entered deeply into the City ofLanka, being respectfully received by the demons."
6-113-2,"That Hanuma, the monkey, known to Seetha, having entered the City of Lanka, seekingpermission from Vibhishana, getting approval from him and entering Ashoka grove as per theprevailing regulation, saw at the foot of a tree, Seetha, who was bereft of freshness, lookingjoylessly like a frightened cow and surrounded with female-demons. Approaching her humbly byoffering salutation to her in bending his head, he stood there silently."
6-113-3,"Even after seeing the mighty Hanuma who came there, Seetha kept herself silent.Then, seeing and recollecting him, she became rejoiced."
6-113-4,"Seeing her cool face, Hanuma the excellent monkey began to narrate the entiremessage of Rama."
6-113-5,"O Seetha! Rama is well, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana, along with Vibhishanaas his supporter and collectively with the army of monkeys."
6-113-6,"O the divine lady! Having destroyed his enemy, Rama the annihilator of hisadversaries, having accomplished his object, is informing you about his welfare. Rama andLakshmana, with the support of Vibhishana and the monkeys, killed the valiant Ravana."
6-113-7,"O the divine lady! I am telling a pleasant news and again eulogizing you. O Seetha,the knower of righteousness! Rama accomplished this great victory in the battle, because of yourpower. Be free from your grief and be comfortable."
6-113-8,"Ravana, the enemy was killed. Even the Lanka has been subdued. With a firmdetermination to win you back, by me who have had no sleep, a bridge has been constructed acrossthe great ocean and this vow (of winning you back) has been fulfilled."
6-113-9,"You ought not to have any fear, living as you do in Ravana's abode. This kingdom ofLanka has now been placed indeed under the dominion ship of Vibhishana."
6-113-10,"That is why, console yourself complacently. You are staying in your own house. ThisVibhishana too is coming to you with a rejoice, as he is so eager to see you."
6-113-11,"Hearing these words, that Seetha the divine lady, whose face resembled the moon,could not speak, tongue-tied as she was with a thrill of delight."
6-113-12,"Thereupon, Hanuma spoke to Seetha, who was not making any answer (as follows): ""Odivine lady! What are you reflecting upon? Why don't you speak to me?"""
6-113-13,"Thus asked by Hanuma, Seetha, who was ever established in a righteous path, was verymuch delighted and spoke (as follows) in a voice choked with tears."
6-113-14,"Hearing these pleasant tidings about the victory of my husband, I became speechlessfor a while, overpowered as I was, by extreme joy."
6-113-15,"O, Hanuman! I indeed do not see any appropriate thing here, which pleases you inreturn, to offer you, who have announced these tidings pleasant to me, even after enervating mybrain."
6-113-16,"Nor, do I perceive anything worthy for you on this earth for you act of conveyingthis agreeable news to me and on bestowing which on you, happiness may come to me."
6-113-17,"Neither silver, nor gold nor even diamonds nor the sovereignty of the three worlds,can be worthy of this message."
6-113-18,"Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma standing with his face turned towards Seetha andwith his hands joined in salutation, joyfully replied as follows:"
6-113-19,"O faultless lady, interested in things agreeable and beneficial to husband andwishing for his victory! You alone deserve to speak such words filled with affection."
6-113-20,"O gentle lady! These words of yours, endowed with preciousness and affection, arebetter than various kinds of collection of diamonds or the sovereignty over the celestials."
6-113-21,"I see Rama victorious and happy, he having killed the enemies and having obtainedvictory. That is to say, I have attained the blessing like the sovereignty over the celestials andother good qualities."
6-113-22,"Hearing those words of Hanuma, Seetha the daughter of Janaka thereupon spoke thefollowing auspicious words to Hanuma."
6-113-23,"You alone can utter these words, endowed with exceedingly good attributes,embellished with a grace of style and filled with an intelligence, consisting of eightexcellences.*"
6-113-24,"You are a praiseworthy and supremely virtuous son of the wind-god. Numerous goodqualities are there in you along (as follows, along with others): strength, valour, knowledge ofscriptures, vigour, prowess, superlative skill (in action), spirit, forbearance, firmness,stability and re is no humility. There is no doubt about it."
6-113-25,"Thereafter, having joined his hands together in salutation, standing in front ofSeetha in humility and free from flurry, Hanuma again spoke to Seetha (as follows):"
6-113-26,"If you permit me, I wish to kill of all these notorious female-demons, by whom youhave been frightened earlier."
6-113-27,"These cruel female-demons of terrific form and behavior, with still more crueleyes, having ugly faces, were heard by me here speaking again and again harsh words to you, who areso devoted to your husband, at Ravana's command, when you were suffering hardships in the Ashokagrove, O divine lady!"
6-113-28,"I wish to kill with various kinds of strokes, these cruel, extremely rough anddeformed female-demons, with distorted features and terrific hairs and eyes, talking togetherroughly. (Pray) grant this boon to me."
6-113-29,"I wish to kill the female-demons, who have spoken harsh words to you and wrongedyou, striking them down with my fists, hand-blows, long arms, blows of my shanks and knees, bycausing pain to their teeth, biting off their ears and nose and pulling out their hair, making themseverely dry-mouthed, tearing them off, leaping over them, encountering them and throwing downtheir bodies, with their burst cheeks, necks, shoulders and ribs."
6-113-30,"O illustrious lady! Striking them with several blows in this way, I would destroythe female-demons of terrible form, by whom you have been threatened in the past."
6-113-31,"Reflecting as pondering for a while, when spoke thus by Hanuma, the compassionateSeetha, who was kind to the miserable, spoke to Hanuma as follows:"
6-113-32,"O the foremost of monkey! Who will be angry with servant-maids, who are dependenton their king's command and work in obedience to the orders of others?"
6-113-33,"All this is reaped by me, as a consequence of my bad fortune or an account of amisdeed committed by me in the past. The fruit of one's own making is indeed experienced (in one'slife)."
6-113-34,"O the great-armed Hanuma! Do not speak like this. This is indeed a great divinestrategy. It was ordained that this type of situation is to be obtained by me, due to theapplication of fate. Feeble as I am in these matters, I am forgiving the servant-maids of Ravanahere."
6-113-35,"O Hanuma! As commanded by Ravana the threatened me. As he is dead now, they willnot do the threatening."
6-113-36,"O Hanuma! There is an old axim possessed of merit, actually uttered by a bear inthe presence of a tiger. Hear it from me."
6-113-37,"A superior person does not take into account the sin of those who have committed anoffence evil for evil must be carried out at all costs virtuous persons account good conduct as anornament."
6-113-38,"Kindness is to be shown by a noble person either towards a sinner or to a virtuousperson or even to a person who deserves death, for, there is none who never commits a wrong."
6-113-39,"No evil is to be done, even to those cruel persons of sinful deeds, who takepleasure to harm the life of others and continue to perpetrate their sinful acts."
6-113-40,"Hearing the words of Seetha, Hanuma who was skilled in speech, then replied to thefaultless Seetha, Rama's consort (as follows):"
6-113-41,"O divine lady! You are the apt wife of Rama, full of virtue. Give me a message inreturn. I will go to the place where Rama is."
6-113-42,"Thus spoken by Hanuma, that Seetha the daughter of Janaka spoke as follows: ""O theforemost of monkeys! I long to see my husband."""
6-113-43,"Hearing those words of Seetha, the highly intelligent Hanuma, the son of wind-god,bringing delight to Seetha, spoke the following words:"
6-113-44,"You shall see today, Rama whose countenance is like a full moon, whose friends(like Sugreeva and Vibhishana) are alive, whose enemies have been killed along with Lakshmana, asShachi (the consort of Indra) would see Indra the lord of gods."
6-113-45,"Thus speaking to that Seetha, who appeared radiant before his eyes as Lakshmi thegoddess of prosperity, Hanuma of great splendor, came to the place where Rama was."
6-113-46,"Then, Hanuma the excellent of monkeys speedily narrated, in order of sequence, themessage given by Seetha, to Rama who was equal to Indra the chief of celestials."
6-114-1,"Having offered his salutation to that Rama, who was excellent among all the wieldersof the bow and whose eyes resembled the lotus-petals, that highly intelligent Hanuma spoke to himas follows:"
6-114-2,"You ought to see Seetha that divine lady who is consumed by grief, for whose sakethis course of actions was undertaken and which has (now) borne fruit."
6-114-3,"Hearing the news of your victory, that Seetha, stricken as she was with grief, isnow longing to see you, her eyes filled with tears of joy."
6-114-4,"By her, who has trust in me because of confidence which has trust in me because ofconfidence which had been inspired me on a former occasion, I was spoken as follows: 'I desire tosee my husband, who has accomplished his purpose, together with Lakshmana.'"
6-114-5,"Hearing Hanuma's words, Rama who was the foremost among the supporters ofrighteousness, was a little over whelmed with tears and suddenly became a bit thoughtful."
6-114-6,"Drawing a deep and warm breath and casting his looks on the ground, he spoke (asfollows) to Vibhishana, who closely resembled a cloud in hue and who was standing nearby."
6-114-7,"Bring here Seetha, after she has bathed her head, has been anointed with charmingcosmetics and adorned with beautiful jewels. Let there be no delay."
6-114-8,"Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana, after entering the gynaecium in haste,communicated his presence to Seetha, through his own women."
6-114-9,"Then, the glorious Vibhishana the king of demons, after seeing the highly fortunateSeetha, with his palms joined over his head, humbly spoke to her as follows:"
6-114-10,"O Seetha! Anointed with charming cosmetics and adorned with beautiful jewels if youplease, mount on the vehicle. Your husband wants to see you."
6-114-11,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, replied as follows: ""O king of demons! I wish tosee my husband, even without taking my bath."""
6-114-12,"Hearing those words of Seetha, Vibhishana replied as follows: ""You ought to do thebidding of Rama, your husband, as he has enjoined you to do."""
6-114-13,"Hearing those words of Vibhishana, the virtuous Seetha, regarding her husband as adivinity, endowed as she was with a devotion to her husband, said in reply, ""So t be!"""
6-114-14,"Prevailing upon Seetha to ascend a shining palanquin, covered with an exceedinglyvaluable cloth and guarded by numerous demons, after she had bathed her head and cleansed her body,had put on costly robes and had been adorned with exceedingly valuable jewels, Vibhishana thenbrought her to the presence of Rama."
6-114-15,"Approaching the great-souled Rama, who was absorbed in thought, even after coming toknow that Seetha had arrived, Vibhishana offered his obeisance and with full of great joy,announced to him that Seetha had arrived."
6-114-16,"Hearing that Seetha had arrived after living long in the abode of a demon, Rama wasfilled with joy, indignation and felt miserable too all the three emotions at the same time."
6-114-17,"Feeling unhappy on considering with deep thought, the question of Seetha having comein a palanquin, all the way, Rama then spoke the following words, looking at Vibhishana who wasbeside him."
6-114-18,"O the gently king of demons, who is forever intent on my victory! Let Seetha dulyseek my presence quickly."
6-114-19,"Hearing those words of that Rama, Vibhishana, who knew what was right, began todisperse the crowd there quickly."
6-114-20,"Demons wearing jackets and turbans, their hands carrying staffs which made ajingling sound, walked there all round, dispersing those warriors."
6-114-21,"Crowds of bears, monkeys and demons, dispersed on all sides, bounced for a distance,from their nearness to the palanquin."
6-114-22,"While those warriors were being driven away, there was a very great sound,resembling the roar of a sea, lashed by a storm."
6-114-23,"Seeing them being dispersed on all sides excited, Rama then stopped that operationof those who were dispersing them, out of kindness (for those who were being driven away) andresentment (at the behaviour of the demons who were dispersing them)."
6-114-24,"The enraged Rama, consuming the demons with his looks as it were, Rama spoke thefollowing reproaching words to the highly intelligent Vibhishana"
6-114-25,"Why disregarding me, are these people harassed by you? Stop this exertion. They aremy own people."
6-114-26,"An apartment is not a thing that protects a woman, nor robes, nor compound-walls,nor concealments nor such royal honours. Her character is her shield."
6-114-27,"A woman becoming visible to public in times of a calamity is not condemned indifficult situations, nor in battles, nor in self-choosing of a husband by a princess at a publicassembly of suitors, nor in sacrificial ceremonies nor in marriage-functions."
6-114-28,"The younder Seetha is in distress and beset with a great difficulty. There is nofault in her appearance in public, particularly in my presence."
6-114-29,"That is why, let her come on foot alone, leaving the palanquin there. Let thesemonkeys see Seetha in my presence."
6-114-30,"Hearing the words of Rama the intelligent Vibhishana, with decency, brought Seethato Rama's vicinity."
6-114-31,"Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana Sugreeva and Hanuma the monkey then felt verymuch perturbed."
6-114-32,"From the pitiless facial features of Rama, showing indifference to his consort, theyconjectured as if Rama had some displeasure towards Seetha."
6-114-33,"Seetha, for her part, shrinking into her limbs with modesty, approached her husband,duly followed by Vibhishana."
6-114-34,"The pleasant-faced Seetha, who considered her husband as the divinity, saw thecharming face of her husband, with a surprise, rejoice and affection."
6-114-35,"Seeing the face of her beloved husband, which had not been seen for a long time andwhich was charming like the rising full moon, she forth dispelled her mental fatigue."
6-115-1,"Seeing that Seetha, who stood at his vicinity bowing low, Rama began to tell hisfeeling hidden in his heart (as follows):"
6-115-2,"You are won back by me, after conquering the enemy in the battle-field, my dearlady! That which is to be done through human effort, has been accomplished by me."
6-115-3,"I have come to the end of my indignation and my outrage has been completelyrequited as also the contempt against the enemy have been wiped out, all at once, by me."
6-115-4,"Now, my manly strength has been seen by all. Today, my toil has borne fruit. Now, Ihave fulfilled my promise. Today, I am the master of myself."
6-115-5,"The wrong done to you, when you were deserted from me, in that you were taken awayby a fickle-minded demon, which was ordained by the destiny, has been corrected by me as a humanbeing."
6-115-6,"What is the use of a prowess, however great, of that weak-minded man who does notwipe out, by his energy, the insult fallen to his lot?"
6-115-7,"The praise-worthy act of Hanuma in the form of crossing of the ocean and thedestroying of Lanka, has borne fruit today."
6-115-8,"The endeavour of Sugreeva, who exhibited his prowess on the battle-field with hisarmy and tendered a good advice, is fruitful today."
6-115-9,"Furthermore, the exertion of Vibhishana, who after deserting his brother who wasvoid of good qualities, sought my presence, is fruitful today."
6-115-10,"Hearing those words spoken thus by Rama, Seetha with her eyes wide open like thoseof a female-deer, was bathed in tears."
6-115-11,"The heart of King Rama, as he saw Seetha, (the beloved of his heart) near him, wastorn for fear of public scandal."
6-115-12,"In the midst of monkeys and demons, Rama spoke (as follows) to Seetha, whose eyesresembled the petals of a lotus, who wore dark curly hair and was endowed with fine hips."
6-115-13,"I, wanting for an honour, have done this particular act, which ought to be done bya man, in killing Ravana and thus wiping away the insult meted out to me."
6-115-14,"You have been won by me, whose mind stands purified by asceticism as the southernquarter, which was difficult to be approached by the world of mortals, was conquered by the SageAgastya."
6-115-15,"Let it be known to you that this endeavor in the shape of war, which has beensuccessful carried through, due to the strength of my friends was not undertaken for your sake. Letthere be prosperity to you! This was done by me in order to keep up my good conduct and to wipe offthe evil-speaking from all sides as well as the insinuation on my own illustrious dynasty."
6-115-16,"You, with a suspicion arisen on your character, standing in front of me, areextremely disagreeable to me, even as a light to one, who is suffering from a poor eye-sight."
6-115-17,"O Seetha! That is why, I am permitting you now. Go wherever you like. All these tendirections are open to you, my dear lady! There is no work to be done to me, by you."
6-115-18,"Which noble man, born in an illustrious race, will take back a woman who lived inanother's abode, with an eager mind?"
6-115-19,"While mentioning greatly about my lineage, how can I accept again, you who wereharassed in Ravana's lap (while being borne away by him) and who were seen (by him) with evillooks?"
6-115-20,"You were won by me with that end in view (viz. the retrieval of my lost honour).The honour has been restored by me. For me, there is no intense attachment in you. You may gowherever you like from here."
6-115-21,"O gracious lady! Therefore, this has been spoken by me today, with a resolved mind.Set you mind on Lakshmana or Bharata, as per your ease."
6-115-22,"O Seetha! Otherwise, set your mind either on Shatrughna or on Sugreeva or onVibhishana the demon; or according to your own comfort."
6-115-23,"Seeing you, who are endowed with a beautiful form and attractive to the sense,detained for long in his abode, Ravana could not have endured your separation."
6-115-24,"Hearing that unpalatable speech of her beloved husband, Seetha who used to hearpleasing words alone, was very much trembled for long, like a creeper attacked by the proboscis ofan elephant and thereupon shed tears."
6-116-1,"Hearing the harsh words with indignation, spoken by Rama, which caused her hair tostand on end, Seetha became very much perturbed."
6-116-2,"Hearing the terrific words of her husband, which were never actually heard by herbefore, amidst a large gathering of people, Seetha stood bent low with shame."
6-116-3,"As though her own limbs were pierced by those words, which were arrow-like withpointed splinters, Seetha shed profuse tears."
6-116-4,"Then, wiping clean her face, which was bathed in tears, she spoke the followingwords slowly, in a stammering voice to her husband."
6-116-5,"O valiant Rama! Why are you speaking such harsh words, which are violent to hearfor me, like a common man speaking to a common woman?"
6-116-6,"O the long-armed one! I am not the one in the way you understand me. Have a faithin me. I swear to you by my own character."
6-116-7,"By the conduct of vulgar woman you distrust the entire race of women. Give up thisdoubt, if I have been actually tested (and found trustworthy) by you."
6-116-8,"O lord! It was not my willfulness, when I came into contact with the person ofRavana. I was helpless. My adverse fate was to blame on that score."
6-116-9,"My heart, which was subservient to me, was abiding in you. What could I do,helpless as I was, with regard to my limbs which had fallen under the sway of another?"
6-116-10,"O bestower of honour! If I could not be fully known to you, in spite of our lovehaving simultaneously grown and despite of our having lived together, I am ruined permanently bysuch ignorance."
6-116-11,"O king! Hanuma, the great hero, was sent by you as your search-agent. Why I, whowas still in Lanka, was not abandoned then itself?"
6-116-12,"O hero! Life would have been given up by me, when deserted by you; immediately onhearing the message (conveying your desertion) before the eyes of the monkey."
6-116-13,"This wasteful endeavour (in the form of crossing over to Lanka and waging waragainst the mighty Ravana, keeping your life in jeopardy), would not have been there, nor wouldhave your friends been put to such fruitless hardship."
6-116-14,"O excellent king! You, however, like a feeble man, gave priority to womanliness,conforming yourself to just an emotion of anger."
6-116-15,"O knower of virtuous conduct! My birth was from Janaka in disguise; but wasactually from the earth. My sacred birth of such a high degree, was not honoured by you."
6-116-16,"My hand taken (by you as a bride) in our childhood was not duly recognized by you.My devotion, my chastity and all have been ignored by you."
6-116-17,"Seetha, thus speaking, weeping and stammering with tears, said to Lakshmana, who wassad and engaged in thoughtfulness (as follows):"
6-116-18,"O Lakshmana! Create a pile of fire, for me, which is a remedy for this disaster. Ino longer wish to survive, smitten as am with false blames."
6-116-19,"I will enter a fire, to obtain the only course appropriate for me, who has beenabandoned amidst an assembly of men, by my husband who was not satisfied with my traits."
6-116-20,"Hearing the words of Seetha, Lakshmana, the destroyer of enemy warriors, giving wayto wrath, looked towards Rama."
6-116-21,"Understanding the inclination of the mind of Rama, hinted by the expression in hisface, that valiant Lakshmana prepared a pyre, in deference to the wishes of Rama."
6-116-22,"No one near and dear was indeed able to cajole on that occasion or to speak or evento look upon Rama, who appeared like Yama the lord of death at the time of dissolution of theworld."
6-116-23,"Thereupon, Seetha, after doing circumambulation to Rama, who was standing with hishead bent low, proceeded towards the blazing fire."
6-116-24,"Having offered salutation to gods and brahmins as also having joined her palms inthe vicinity of the fire, Seetha spoke the following words:"
6-116-25,"As my heart never moves off from Rama, so let the fire-god, the witness of theworld, protect me from all sides."
6-116-26,"As Rama apprehends me, though of unimpeachable conduct, to be spoilt, let thefire-god the witness of the world protect me from all sides."
6-116-27,"As I have never been unfaithful in act, thought and speech to Rama, who knows allthe virtues, so let the fire-god protect me."
6-116-28,"Since the adorable sun-god, wind-god, the four quarters and even so the moon-god,as also the deity presiding over the day-time and the twilights and the night and the earth andeven others know me to be endowed with good conduct, so let the fire-god protect me."
6-116-29,"Thus speaking, Seetha walking around the fire-god, with her mind free fromhesitation, entered the blazing fire."
6-116-30,"A large gathering of men including children and elders, saw the shining Seethahaving entered the fire there."
6-116-31,"That Seetha, with the shining of fresh refined gold and decked with ornaments ofrefined gold, plunged into the blazing fire, in the presence of all people."
6-116-32,"All the living beings saw then that wide-eyed Seetha, who looked like a goldenaltar, plunging into the fire."
6-116-33,"The sages, gods, and the Gandharvas saw that illustrious Seetha entering deep intothe fire as a sacred oblation of clarified butter."
6-116-34,"All the women (who were present there) screamed on seeing her, rushing into thefire, like a gush of clarified butter plunging into the sacrificial fire, duly consecrated by Vedichymns."
6-116-35,"The denizens of the entire three worlds including the gods, Gandharvas and demons,beheld her falling into the fire, like a goddess, subjected to a curse, falling from heaven tohell."
6-116-36,"While she was entering deeply into the fire, a loud sound, which appeared strange,uttering 'Alas, Alas' rose both from the demons and the monkeys alike."
6-117-1,"Hearing the cries of these who were thus wailing, the virtuous minded Rama thenbecame thoughtful for a while, afflicted as he was with melancholy, his eyes filled with tears."
6-117-2,"Thereupon, Kubera the King of Yakshas, Yama the lord of death together with thedeceased ancestors, Indra the lord of celestials Varuna the lord of waters, the illustrious Shivathe great deity who bears the device of a bull as his banner and having three eyes, Brahma thecreator of all the worlds and the best among the knowers of sacred knowledge all these togetherreaching the City of Lanka in aerial cars, shining like the sun approached Rama."
6-117-3,"Lifting their long arms, their hands decked with ornaments, those excellent godsthereupon, spoke (as follows) to Rama who stood there, making a respectful salutation to them withhis folded hands."
6-117-4,"How do you, the maker of the entire cosmos, the foremost among those endowed withknowledge and an all-capable person, ignore Seetha who is falling into the fire? How do you notrecognize yourself to be the foremost of the troop of gods?"
6-117-5,"Among the Vasus (a class of gods, eight in number), you are the Vasu, namedR^itadhama (one whose abode is Truth or the Divine Law) who was formerly the self-constitutedruler, the first creator of all the three worlds and the lord of creatures."
6-117-6,"You are the eighth Rudra among (eleven) Rudras and the fifth (Viryavan by name)among the Sadhyas (a particular class of celestials belonging to Gana Devata). The twin Aswinis areyour ears. The sun and the moon constitute your eyes."
6-117-7,"O the destroyer of the adversaries. You are seen (to exist) at the beginning and atthe end of creation. Yet, you ignore Seetha, just like a common man."
6-117-8,"Hearing the words of those guardians of the world, Rama, the lord of creation, whowas born in Raghu dynasty and the foremost one among protectors of righteousness, spoke to thosegod-chiefs as follows:"
6-117-9,"I think of myself to be a human being, by name Rama, the son of Dasaratha. You, asa gracious Divinity, tell me that which I as such really am like this."
6-117-10,"Hearing the words of Rama, Brahma (the creator), the foremost among the knowers ofBrahma the Absolute, spoke as follows: ""Listen to my true word, O the truly brave lord!"""
6-117-11,"You are the Lord Narayana himself the glorious god, who wields the discus. You arethe Divine Boar with a single tusk, the conqueror of your past and future enemies."
6-117-12,"You are Brahma, the imperishable, the Truth abiding in the middle as well as at theend of the universe. You are the supreme righteousness of people, whose powers go everywhere. Youare the four-armed."
6-117-13,"You are the wielder of a bow called Sarnga, the lord of the senses, the supremesoul of the universe, the best of men, the invincible, the wielder of a sword named Nandaka, theall-pervader, the bestower of happiness to the earth and endowed with great might."
6-117-14,"You are the leader of the army and the village headman. You are the intellect. Youare the endurance and the subduer of the senses. You are the origin and the dissolution of all,Upendra the Divine Dwarf and (the younger brother of Indra) as also the destroyer Madhu, thedemon."
6-117-15,"You perform action for Indra the lord of celestials, the Supreme Ruler, the onehaving a lotus in one's navel and who puts an end to all in battle. The divine sages pronounce youto be fit to afford protection to all and the refuge for all."
6-117-16,"In the form of the Vedas, you are the great Bull with hundred heads (rules) andthousand horns (precepts). You are the first creator of all, the three worlds, and the selfconstituted Lord of all. You are the refuge and the forbear of Siddhas (a class of demi-godsendowed with mystic powers by virtue of their very birth) and Sadhyas (a class of celestialbeings.)"
6-117-17,"You are the sacrificial performance. You are the sacred syllable 'Vashat' (onhearing which the Adhvaryu priest casts the oblation to a deity into the sacrificial fire). You arethe mystic syllable 'OM'. You are higher than the highest. People neither know your end nor yourorigin nor who you are in reality."
6-117-18,"You appear in all created beings in the cattle and in brahmanas. You exist in allquarters, in the sky, in mountains and in rivers."
6-117-19,"With thousand feet, with hundred heads and with thousand eyes along with Lakshmithe goddess of wealth, you bear the earth with all its created beings along with itsmountains."
6-117-20,"O Rama! You appear as Sesha, a large serpent in water, at the earth's bottom,bearing the three worlds, gods, Gandharvas, the celestial musicians and the demons."
6-117-21,"O Rama! I (brahma) am your heart. Saraswathi, the goddess (of learning) is yourtongue. O lord! The gods created by Brahma are the hair on all your limbs."
6-117-22,"Night has been recognized as the closing of your eye-lids and the day, as theopening of eye-lids. The correct usages of your words are the Vedas. Bereft of you, this visibleuniverse does not exist."
6-117-23,"The entire cosmos is your body. The earth constitutes your firmness. Fire is youranger. The moon constitutes your placidity. You are Lord Vishnu (who bears the mark Srivatsa - acurl of white hair on his breast)."
6-117-24,"In the past, the three worlds were occupied by you in your three strides, afterbinding the exceptionally formidable Bali (the ruler of the three worlds) and Indra was made theking (by you)."
6-117-25,"Seetha is no other than Goddess Lakshmi (the divine consort of Lord Vishnu), whileyou are Lord Vishnu. You are having a shining dark-blue hue. You are the Lord of created beings.For the destruction of Ravana, you entered a human body here, on this earth."
6-117-26,"O Rama, the foremost among the supporters of righteousness! The aforesaid purposeof ours has been fulfilled. Ravana has been killed. Return to your divine abode, with arejoice."
6-117-27,"O Lord! Unerring is your valour. Your exploits are never in vain. O Rama! Yourblessed sight is powerful. The songs in praise of you never go in vain."
6-117-28,"Those humans who are full of devotion to you will never be unsuccessful on thisearth. Those who are devoted to you, the primeval and the eternal lord, belonging to ancient timesand the Supreme Person, will forever attain their desired objects here as well as hereafter."
6-117-29,"Humiliation will never be the plight of those humans who will recite this hymn in adivine ancient history, sung by Brahma, the foremost seer."
6-118-1,"Hearing the foregoing auspicious words of Brahma (the creator), the fire-god cameup, taking Seetha in his arms."
6-118-2,"Shaking off that funeral pile and taking that Seetha, the daughter of Janaka in hisarms, the fire-god forthwith sprang up at once in a personified form."
6-118-3,"Bearing in his arms the youthful Seetha, who was shining brightly as the rising sun,was decked in ornaments of refined gold, attired in a red robe and wore dark curly hair, who wasfurther adorned with ornaments of flowers, which had not abraded (on her entering the fire andcoming out of it), who was absolutely beyond reproach and looked just the same (as she did whileentering the fire and coming out of it), who was absolutely beyond reproach and looked just thesame (as she did while entering the flames), the fire-god restored her to Rama."
6-118-4,"Then, the fire-god, the witness of the whole world, spoke to Rama as follows ""Hereis your Seetha. No sin exists in her."""
6-118-5,"This auspicious lady, whose character has been good, has never been unfaithful toyou who are endowed with strength of character either by word or by mind or even by intellect or byher glances."
6-118-6,"Separated from you, this miserable and helpless lady, was taken away by Ravana thedemon, who was arrogant of his valour, from a lonely hermitage."
6-118-7,"This Seetha, who was fixing her mind upon you ad looking on you as her finalattainment, was detained in the gynaecium and hidden there. She was guarded by rightfulfemale-demons with horrible intellect."
6-118-8,"Seetha, whose mind was directed towards you, ignored that demon even though alluredand frightened through various means."
6-118-9,"Take back Seetha, who is sinless, with a pure character. She should not be toldanything harsh. I hereby command you."
6-118-10,"Rama, the excellent among the eloquent, whose mind was set on virtue, with apleasant mind to hear the aforesaid speech, reflected for a while, his eyes, entirely filed withtears of joy."
6-118-11,"Hearing those words, the courageous Rama of great prowess and the foremost of thoseupholding the virtue, replied to the fire-god, the best of gods."
6-118-12,"Seetha certainly deserves this pure factory ordeal in the eyes of the people in asmuch as this blessed woman had resided for a long time indeed in the gynaecium of Ravana."
6-118-13,"The world would chatter against me, saying that Rama, the son of Dasaratha, wasreally foolish and that his mind was dominated by lust, if I accept Seetha without examining herwith regard to her chastity."
6-118-14,"I also know that Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, who ever revolves in my mind, isundivided in her affection to me."
6-118-15,"Ravana could not violate this wide-eyed woman, protected as she was by her ownsplendour, any more than an ocean would transgress its bounds."
6-118-16,"In order to convince the three worlds, I, whose refugee is truth, ignored Seethawhile she was entering the fire."
6-118-17,"The evil-minded Ravana was not able to lay his violent hands, even in thought, othe unobtainable Seetha, who was blazing like a flaming tongue of fire."
6-118-18,"This auspicious woman could not give way to the sovereignty, existing in thegynaecium of Ravana, in as much as Seetha is not different from me, even as sunlight is notdifferent from the sun."
6-118-19,"Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, is completely pure in her character, in all thethree worlds and can no longer be renounced by me, as a good name cannot be cast aside by a prudentman."
6-118-20,"The salutary advice of you all, the affectionate guardians of the world, who aresaying what is conducive to our good, must be certainly carried out by me."""
6-118-21,"Saying thus and getting reunited with her beloved Seetha, the victorious and highlyillustrious Rama, a scion of Raghu dynasty, who was endowed with a great strength and deservedhappiness and was being glorified by his exploits, performed by his own self, experienced joy."
6-119-1,"Hearing the auspicious words thus spoken by Rama, Lord Shiva the Supreme Lordthereupon delivered the following still more beautiful speech:"
6-119-2,"O lotus-eyed, long-armed, broad-chested, annihilator of enemies and excellent amongthose upholding the cause of virtue! Thank heaven! You accomplished this task."
6-119-3,"Fortunately has the fear born of Ravana - which increased the severe darkness onthe entire world has been removed by you, on the battle-field, O Rama!"
6-119-4,"You are fit to go to the heaven, by comforting the depressed Bharata and theillustrious Kausalya as well as seeing Kaikeyi and Sumitra, the mother of Lakshmana having got thesovereignty of Ayodhya, bringing delight to your friends, stabilizing the back-bone in the race ofIkshvaku, getting excellent glory by performing a horse-sacrifice and by granting riches toBrahmanas."
6-119-5,"This king Dasaratha, your father in this mortal world and the highly glorious aswell as the venerable person, is seated in an aerial car, O Rama!"
6-119-6,"Having been delivered by you, his (godly) son, the glorious king obtained the abodeof Indra the lord of celestials. you offer your respectful salutation to him, along with Lakshmana,your brother."
6-119-7,"Hearing the words of Shiva, Rama along with Lakshmana his brother, offered theirsalutation to their father, seated on the topmost part of an aerial car."
6-119-8,"The lord Rama along with Lakshmana his brother saw their father, who was blazingwith his own splendour and clad in brilliant garments."
6-119-9,"Then the king Dasaratha the lord who was sitting in the aerial car, in an excellentseat, was filled with excessive delight to see his son (Rama), who was dearer to him than life.Placing him in his lap and embracing him in his arms, he thereupon commenced his speech asfollows:"
6-119-10,"O Rama! Separated from you, the heaven is not a liking to me, nor the respect givento me by the foremost of celestials. I am telling you the truth."
6-119-11,"Today, there is a great joy for me, for having seen you, fully satisfied in yourmind, now that your enemies have been destroyed and you have fully gone through the period ofexile."
6-119-12,"O excellent among the eloquent! The words, which were uttered by Kaikeyi, with anaim to send you into exile, are still imprinted in my heart."
6-119-13,"Seeing you in a fine fettle with Lakshmana and hugging you today, I standcompletely rid of sorrow - even as the sun is freed from mist."
6-119-14,"O great-souled son! I have been redeemed by you, my worthy son, even as Kahola abrahmana was redeemed by Ashtavakra."
6-119-15,"O gently one! I recognize you now to be the Supreme person, duly enjoined here bythe rulers of gods, for the destruction of Ravana."
6-119-16,"Blessed indeed is Kausalya, who will see you, the destroyer of your enemies,returned home from the forest."
6-119-17,"Blessed indeed are those men, who will see you returned to the City of Ayodhya andconsecrated on the throne as a lord of the earth."
6-119-18,"I desire to see you, re-united with the mighty Bharata, who is affectionate towardsyou, honest and virtuous."
6-119-19,"O gentle one! You spent fourteen years, residing in the forest with Lakshmana andSeetha."
6-119-20,"You completed the term of your exile. My pledge was implemented by you. Thecelestials too have been fully gratified, by your killing of Ravana in battle."
6-119-21,"O the destroyer of enemies! A laudable act has been done and glory has been earnedby you. Getting consecrated on the throne, may you attain a long life, along with yourbrothers."
6-119-22,"To Dasaratha, who was thus speaking, Rama with joined palms in salutation, submitted(as follows): ""Be gracious to Kaikeyi and Bharata, O the knower of virtues!"""
6-119-23,"You will remember those words spoken by you saying, I disown you, with your son(Bharata)'. May that terrific curse not touch Kaikeyi and her son, O Lord!"""
6-119-24,"Saying 'May it be"" to Rama who stood with joined palms embraced Lakshmana. Dasarathaagain uttered the following words to Lakshmana:"
6-119-25,"A great gratification has been rendered to me and reward in the form of religiousmerit earned by you in that you served Rama and Seetha, the princess of Videha kingdom, withdevotion."
6-119-26,"Rama, being pleased with you, you will attain religious merit and extensive gloryon earth, as also heaven and excellent power O knower of righteousness!"
6-119-27,"Happiness to you, O the augmentor of the joy of Sumitra, your mother! Serve Ramawell. Rama forever is intent on advancing the interests of the entire world."
6-119-28,"These three worlds, including Indra Siddhas (a class of demi-gods) and great sagespay homage to the great-souled Rama as a Supreme person, on approaching him."
6-119-29,"O great one! O the destroyer of adversaries! Rama has been spoken of as theunmanifest and the imperishable Brahama (the absolute), established by the Vedas, the heart of godsand the secret of all gods."
6-119-30,"Having served him, along with Seetha with devotion, you obtained the reward of thepractice of all virtues as also celebrity, abundantly."
6-119-31,"Thus speaking to Lakshmana, the (former) king, addressing his daughter-in-lawstanding before him with joined palms as ""My daughter"", slowly and affectionately advised her asfollows:"
6-119-32,"No wrath indeed should be rendered by you towards Rama, for having repudiated you.This has been done by him, wishing for your welfare and in order to demostrate your purity."
6-119-33,"This act (of entering into fire) which has been done by you and which reveals yourtrue character, my daughter, is the most difficult task to perform for other ladies and willovershadow their illustriousness."
6-119-34,"You need not be instructed about the matter of rendering service to your husband.But, it is to be told certainly by me. He is your supreme deity."
6-119-35,"Having instructed thus to his sons and Seetha, the King Dasaratha who was born inRaghu dynasty went to the abode of Indra, the lord of celestials, by an aerial car."
6-119-36,"With a satisfied self, Dasaratha the excellent king of noble-mindedness endowed withsplendour, taking leave of his sons and Seetha and mounting the aerial car, went to the abode ofIndra, the chief of gods."
6-120-1,"When Dasaratha returned, the Lord Indra, the destroyer of Paka the demon, was verymuch pleased and spoke to Rama, who stood there with his oined palms."
6-120-2,"O Rama, the foremost among men! Your sight of us, should not go in vain. Therefore,tell us whatever is desired by you."
6-120-3,"Hearing the words of the great souled Indra the lord of celestials, after havingbeen pleased, Rama with the most placid mind spoke the following words with rejoice:"
6-120-4,"O the foremst among the eloquent! O Indra! If you have affection in me, I shallspeak out my words. Make my words real."
6-120-5,"Let all the monkeys, who reached the abode of death, after displaying theirenergyfor"
6-120-6,"O the bestower of honour! I wish to see all those monkeys, who for my sake, wereremoved from their sons and wives, be delighted at heart."
6-120-7,"They were all valiant, proving their energies and did not take their death intoaccount. They made their strenuous efforts and died. O Indra! Restore their lives to them."
6-120-8,"Those mokeys - who coutned death as nothing and who were fond of doing favour to me- let them get re-united with their near and dear ones by your grace. I seek this boon of you."
6-120-9,"O bestower of honour! I wish to see the monkeys and bears, free from wounds andpains, with augmented strength and valour."
6-120-10,"Wherever the aforesaid monkeys live, let there be rivers with crystal-clear water,flowers, roots and fruits even in an off-season."
6-120-11,"Hearing the words of that great-souled Rama, Indra the lord of celestials endowed ashe was with delight, again spoke the following words:"
6-120-12,"O beloved Rama! This boon, which has been sought by you is hard to grant. No offerhas, however, been revised by me in the past. Therefore this will come to be."
6-120-13,"Let all those monkeys and bears along with long-tailed monkeys, who have beenkilled in battle, by the demons and whose heads and arms have been severed, be alive and activeagain."
6-120-14,"Without any ill-health andwounds and with boosted strength and valour, the monkeyswill srise again, as those fallen asleep would do at the end of their sleep."
6-120-15,"All of them, full of delight, will get re-united with their friends, relatives,kinsmen and family members."
6-120-16,"O the wielder of a great bow! The trees will look colourful with flowers and fruitseven in the off-season. Rivers too will remain constantly with water."
6-120-17,"Thereupon, all those monkey-warriors got up, as if from a sleep, with all theirlimbs completely healed of wounds. All the monkeys felt surprised, saying to one another ""Whatmiracle is this?"""
6-120-18,"Seeing Rama, whose wish has been fully realised, all the foremost of celestials,with a great delight, spoke praisingly to Rama and Lakshmana:"
6-120-19,"O monarch! Proceed to Ayodhya from here and disband the monkeys. Reassure thisillustrious and devoted Seetha."
6-120-20,"O destroyer of adversaries! See Bharata, your brother, who is practisingausterities through grief caused by separation from you, the great-souled Shatrughna and all yourmohters. Get yourself consecrated on the throne. Bring rejoice to the citizens, by goingthere."
6-120-21,"Thus speaking to Rama and Lakshmana, Idnra the thousand-eyed god of celestials,having beenpleased, returned to heaven with other gods in their aerial cars, shining liek thesun."
6-120-22,"having respectfully saluted all those celestials, Rama along with Lakshmana hisbrother, then instructed all the monkeys to take rest in their respective places."
6-120-23,"Thereupon, that illustrious and mighty army of rejoiced troops, for its part, whichwas protected by Lakshmana and Rama, and was blazing with splendour on all sides, shone brightlylike the might, illumined by the moon."
6-121-1,"Vibhishana, wishing victory to Rama, (the destroyer of adversaries) who havingreposed during the previous night and had risen fresh, spoke to him with joined palms, thefollowing words:"
6-121-2,"These women with lotus-like eyes, who are skilled in the art of decoration, camewith bathing accessories like garments, ornaments, sandal-pastes and beautiful garlands of variouskinds. They will assist you in bathing O Rama!"
6-121-3,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Rama replied as follows: ""You invite the monkeysheaded by Sugreeva for the bath."""
6-121-4,"That Bharata, the virtuous man, who was accustomed to comfort, a delicate youth,the great-armed and the one consistent with the truth is suffering on my account."
6-121-5,"In the absence of Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, who is practicing virtue, ritualbathing, garments and jewels are not to my liking."""
6-121-6,"See how we may return to that City of Ayodhya soon. It is indeed very difficult totravel over this path to reach Ayodhya City, so soon."
6-121-7,"Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana replied : ""O prince! I will get you t thatCity in a day."""
6-121-8,"O Rama of unequalled prowess! The aerial car shining like the sun, which moves asone pleases, wonderful and excellent, named Pushpaka of Kubera my brother was robbed by the mightyRavana after conquering Kubera in battle. May prosperity attend you! It is retained there for yoursake."
6-121-9,"The yonder aerial car, looking like a cloud, stands here and by which transport,you can reach Ayodhya without any trouble."
6-121-10,"O sagacious prince! If I deserve to be treated with kindness by you, if you thinkof any virtue in me and if you think of any virtue in me and if you have any affection in me, stayhere for some more time."
6-121-11,"O Rama! When you have been offered with reference all the entertainments, you alongwith Lakshmana, your brother and Seetha your consort, shall then depart."
6-121-12,"O Rama! In the meantime, accept you, with your entire army and assemblage offriends, my hospitality which has been fixed and arranged by me, full of affection as I am."
6-121-13,"O Rama! I entreat you with affection, respect and friendship I am your servant. Iam not in any way commanding you to do so."
6-121-14,"Hearing those words, Rama replied to Vibhishana as follows, while all the demons andthe monkeys present there, listened:"
6-121-15,"O destroyer of enemies! O hero! I stand honoured by you by your valued counsel,your efforts put forth with your whole soul and more so by your friendship."
6-121-16,"O king of demons! It is not that I am not carrying out your words. But, my heart ishastening to see that Bharata, my brother."
6-121-17,"My heart is hastening to see that Bharata, who came all the way to Mount Chitrakutato take me back to Ayodhya, yet whose appeal was not executed by me, even though he requested mewith his head bent low and Kausalya my mother as also Sumitra and the illustrious Kaikeyi (mystep-mothers) as also Guha my friend, as well as the citizens of Ayodhya and the inhabitants of thecountry-side."
6-121-18,"O gentle Vibhishana! Allow me to go. I am honoured. O friend! You need not bedisappointed, I entreat you."
6-121-19,"O the king of demons! Fetch the aerial car immediately. How is it advisable for mycontinued stay here, now that my task has been accomplished?"
6-121-20,"Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana the king of demons then hastily invoked thepresence of that aerial car shining like the sun, with colourful parts made of gold, with theplatform made of cat's-eye gems, which was full of attics, shone like silver on all sides,decorated well with white flags and flag-staff, decked with gold and golden lotuses, graced withgolden mansions, hung all over with networks of tiny bells, giving forth a melodious sound on allsides, resembling a summit of Mount Meru, built by Vishvakarma, which was graced with statelypalaces decked with pearls and silver, provided with pavements inlaid with crystal, furnished withexcellent seats of cat's eye gems of great value and upholstered with highly valuablecoverings."
6-121-21,"Informing Rama that the said aerial car which could not be assailed and was as swiftas though- had arrived, Vibhishana stood there."
6-121-22,"The generous minded Rama along with Lakshmana felt amazed to see the aforesaidaerial car, Pushpaka, which resembled a mountain and which could travel everywhere at will, arrivedon that occasion."
6-122-1,"Keeping ready Pushpaka the aerial car decorated with flowers, Vibhishana, for hispart, standing not very far, spoke to Rama (as follows):"
6-122-2,"What more can I do? thus spoke with haste, Vibhishana endowed as he was withmodesty and with joined palms, to Rama."
6-122-3,"After some circumspection, Rama of great splendor, affectionately spoke thefollowing words to him, while Lakshmana was listening:"
6-122-4,"Let all these monkeys and bears (ie. Denizens of forests), who performed tasks ofexertion, be honoured with tasks of exertion, be honoured with precious stones and riches ofvarious kinds, O Vibhishana!"
6-122-5,"O Vibhishana the king of demons! Lanka has conquered by you, in collaboration withthese monkeys, who never turned their backs in battles and fought joyfully, ignoring all risk totheir lives."
6-122-6,"All these monkeys, without exceptions, have accomplished their task. Reward theirachievement with gifts of gold and precious stones."
6-122-7,"Highly honoured in this way any duly cheered by you, acknowledging their services,the chiefs of monkey-troops, will feel happy."
6-122-8,"All will come nearer to you, for having possessed this quality of generosity, forpropitiating them, for showing compassion to them and for having subjugated your senses. Hence, Iam reminding you."
6-122-9,"O king! Feeling agitated, the army deserts that king, who is bereft of all lovingqualities and who merely orders them to kill people in battle."
6-122-10,"Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana honoured all those monkeys, by dispersingprecious stones and gold to them."
6-122-11,"Thereafter, having seen on that occasion all those commanders of monkey-troopshonoured with precious stones and gold, Rama then mounted that excellent aerial car."
6-122-12,"He mounted the aerial car along with Lakshmana, his valiant brother wielding a bowand taking the illustrious Seetha, who was feeling abashed, in his arms."
6-122-13,"Bestowing attention on all the monkeys as well as Vibhishana and the mightySugreeva, Rama remaining in the aerial car, spoke (as follows):"
6-122-14,"O the foremost of monkeys! This work of a friend has been accomplished by you.Permitted by me, all of you can go, where you will."
6-122-15,"O Sugreeva! All that which ought to be done by an affectionate and service-mindedfriend, has been done for your part by you, trembling alive as you are to righteousness.Accompanied by your army, proceed to Kishkindha at once."
6-122-16,"O Vibhishana! Settle down in your kingdom at Lanka, conferred by me. Even thecelestials including Indra shall not be able to attack you."
6-122-17," I am going to Ayodhya, the seat of government of my father. I bid adieu to you andwish to take leave of you all."
6-122-18,"Hearing the words of Rama, the monkey-chiefs, the monkeys, Vibhishana the demon andall of them there, with their joined palms, spoke (as follows):"
6-122-19,"We also wish to proceed to Ayodhya. You take all of us there we shall range thegardens and groves there with rejoice."
6-122-20,"O the excellent king! Seeing you, drench with ablution (in the coronation ceremony)and offering our salutations to Kausalya, we shall return to our homes."
6-122-21,"Hearing those words of the monkeys and Vibhishana, that pious-minded Rama spoke tothose monkeys, Sugreeva and Vibhishana as follows:"
6-122-22,"Something more dearer than everything dear will be achieved by me, if I reachAyodhya with the host of my friends along with all of you, for, I shall feel delighted."
6-122-23,"O Sugreeva! Mount the aerial cars quickly, along with the monkeys. O Vibhishana,the king of demons! You also ascend it, along with your counsellors."
6-122-24,"Thereupon, that Sugreeva along with the monkeys gladly ascended that wonderfulPushpaka, the aerial car. Vibhishana together with his counselors also ascended it."
6-122-25,"When all of them ascended, that excellent aerial car, belonging to Kubera, flew intothe sky, after having been duly authorized by Rama."
6-122-26,"Feeling greatly rejoiced and satisfied while travelling in that splendid aerial car,which was now in the air and was provided with the image of a swan, Rama shone like Kubera."
6-122-27,"All those mighty monkeys, bears and demons sat comfortably and spaciously in thatwonderful aerial car."
6-123-1,"As approved by Rama, that excellent aerial car, with images of swan painted on it,flew into the sky, with a great sound."
6-123-2,"Casting his look on all sides, Rama, the delight of Raghu dynasty, then spoke toSeetha, who had a moon-like face (as follows):"
6-123-3,"O Seetha! Look at the City of Lanka, resting firmly on the mount of Trikuta,looking like a peak of Mount Kailasa and built by Viswarakarma, the universal architect."
6-123-4,"O Seetha! Look at this great battle-field, covered with a mud of flesh and blood asalso a cause for the death of monkeys and demons."
6-123-5,"O the large-eyed Seetha! Here lies Ravana, the king of demons, the tormentator ofpeople, on whom boons were conferred by Brahma and who was killed by me for your sake."

Here is the region, (known as Panchavati, so calledbecause it consists of five banyan trees) where Khara the demon was killed by me withstraight-going arrows, as also his brothers, Dushana and the mighty Trishiras.

6-123-49,"Thereupon, the monkeys along with the demons beheld that Ayodhya, having rows ofwhite palaces, intersected with wide roads, and crowded with elephants and horses, looking likeAmaravathi, the City of Indra the lord of Celestials."
6-124-1,"After completion of fourteen years of his exile and on the fifth day of the brighthalf of the lunar month of Ashvayuja (roughly corresponding to the month of September), Rama, whowas disciplined even now, reaching the hermitage of the sage Bharadwaja, offered his salutation tothe sage."
6-124-2,"Having offered his obeisance to Bharadwaja, who was rich in asceticism, Ramaenquired (of him): ""Have you heard, O venerable one, of Ayodhya City having an abundance of foodand free from disease? Is that Bharata attentive in his rule? I hope my mothers are stillalive."""
6-124-3,"Hearing the words of Rama, Bharadwaja the great sage, quite rejoiced as he was,smilingly replied to Rama (as follows):"
6-124-4,"Bharata, with his mud-smeared limbs 9throwing the burden and blame ie. mud and withmatted locks, as also placing your wooden-sandals before him, is looking forward for your arrival.All are safe at your home and in the city."
6-124-5,"O Rama, the victorious in battles! Formerly, on seeing you penetrating deeply intothe great forest on foot, with the sole intention of practicing virtue, clad in pieces of bark,going away from sovereignty, deprived of all enjoyments, like an immortal fallen from heaven,having renounced all your possession, with your spouse (Seetha) as the third (of your party besidesLakshmana and yourself), resolved in carrying out the behest of your father and intent onimplementing the pledge given (by your father) to Kaikeyi and living on wild roots and fruits, pityarose in me earlier."
6-124-6,"But now, a great delight occurred to me, on seeing you, having fulfilled yourpurpose, that you have conquered your enemies and are accompanied by your host of friends andrelatives."
6-124-7,"That joy and sorrow experienced by you in abundance while residing inJanasthana-forest in completely known to me, O Rama!"
6-124-8,"While you were busy in protecting all the ascetics who prayed you for safeguardingthe interests of Brahmanas, this irreproachable wife of yours was taken away by Ravana."
6-124-9,"O Rama, devoted to virtue! Even the appearance of Mareecha, the abduction of Seethaby Ravana, the sight of Kabandha, your arrival at the Pampa lake, your alliance with Sugreeva, howVali was killed by you, the search-operation for Seetha, the exploit of Hanuma, the tracing ofSeetha, how the bridge, Nalasetu was constructed (over the sea), how the City of Lanka was set fireby the rejoiced monkey-chiefs, how that Ravana who was the thorn in the side of gods and how wasarrogant of his might, was killed in battle, with his sons kinsfolk and his ministers as the godshappened, how a boon was conferred by them on you- all this is known to me by virtue of myasceticism. My disciples, who were accustomed to report to me the news, used to go to Ayodhya-Cityfrom here."
6-124-10,"The friends, the riches and the grains are highly honoured in this world. Motherand mother-land are far superior to even the heaven."
6-124-11,"Bowing to the aforesaid statement of the sage with his head bent low, highly pleasedas he was and saying, ""By all means"" the glorious prince (Rama) asked of him the followingboon:"
6-124-12,"O venerable sir! Let all the trees on the way, even as I fly to Ayodhya, bear fruiteven in the off-season and flow with honey. Let abundant fruits of various kinds, emitting thefragrance of nectar, appear on them."
6-124-13,"Once the consent of the sage was given in the words ""be it so"", the trees there grewto be closely like the heavenly trees."
6-124-14,"Then, for an extent of three Yojanas (twenty four miles) on all sides, in thedirection of their travel, the trees that no longer bore fruit, were laden with fruit and thosewhich had ceased to blossom looked charming with blossom. The withered trees were fully clothedwith foliage and further began to flow with honey."
6-124-15,"Highly rejoiced who had conquered the heaven, those monkey-chiefs thereupon consumedat will, thousands of many of those wonderful fruits."
6-125-1,"Looking at Ayodhya, Rama, a scion of Raghu dynasty, for his part, who wished to do akindly act and who was quick in exhibiting prowess, contemplated thereupon to do a kindly act."
6-125-2,"Having thus contemplated, the sagacious and the glorious Rama then cast his glimpseon the monkeys and spoke to Hanuma, the monkey (as follows):"
6-125-3,"O the foremost of the monkeys! Going with all speed to Ayodhya, find out whetherthe people there, are safe in the royal palace."
6-125-4,"Reaching then to Shrigaberapura, communicate in my name, about my welfare to Guha,the king of Nishadas, a wild tribe living in the forest."
6-125-5,"Guha will be pleased to hear about me, as being safe, healthy and free fromtrouble. He is my friend, as well as my own self."
6-125-6,"Feeling pleased, Guha, the lord of Nishadas, the wild tribe, will tell the path toAyodhya and the news about Bharata."""
6-125-7,"Bharata too is to be asked by you, the news about his welfare, in my name. Tell himof me as having returned, accomplished of our object, with my consort and Lakshmana."
6-125-8,"Tell him about the abduction of Seetha by the mighty Ravana, my conversation withSugreeva and the killing of Vali in combat."
6-125-9,"Tell him also about the search for Seetha and how she was traced out by you, aftercrossing the never-diminishing ocean, having extensive waters."
6-125-10,"Tell him about our going near the ocean, the appearance of the ocean, how thebridge was constructed there and how Ravana was killed."
6-125-11,"Tell him about the bestower of boons by Indra the lord of celestials, by brahma thelord of creation, and by Varuna the lord of waters, my meeting with my (deceased) father, throughthe grace of Shiva the Supreme Deity."
6-125-12,"O gentle Hanuma! Inform to Bharata, of me as having come near Ayodhya, along withVibhishana and Sugreeva the lord of monkeys."
6-125-13,"Tell him, that having conquered hosts of enemies and obtained an excellent fame, ispurpose having been accomplished, Rama is coming near, with is mighty friends."
6-125-14,"It is also to be observed by you, about the facial expression which Bharata wears,after hearing all this and also all that he intends to do in relation to me."
6-125-15,"All the occurrences there are to be known. All the gestures of Bharata are to beascertained through the colour of his face, glances and the speech."
6-125-16,"Whose mind does not turn round, with a kingdom abundantly rich in all covetedenjoyments, teeming with elephants horses and chariots and which is in herited from one'sfather?"
6-125-17,"Having been associated with the kingdom for long, if the illustrious Bharata islonging for it himself, let Bharata rule the entire kingdom in one piece."
6-125-18,"O Hanuma! Understanding his mind and perception, you ought to return quickly,before we are not gone for a long distance towards Ayodhya."
6-125-19,"Assuming a human form, when thus commanded by Rama, Hanuma the son of wind-god,swiftly left for Ayodhya."
6-125-20,"Hanuma, the son of wind-god then flew up with speed towards Ayodhya, as Garuda theeagle would fly with speed, while seeking to catch a large snake."
6-125-21,"Leaping into the auspicious sky, the dwelling place of birds, duly crossing over theterrific conjunction of Ganga and Yamuna rivers, reaching Shringaverapura and approaching Guha (thechief of Nishadas), that valiant Hanuma spoke the following words in a charming voice:"
6-125-22,"Along with Seetha and Lakshmana, Rama, your friend, that scion of Kakutthsa, oftrue prowess, has for his part enquired of your welfare."
6-125-23,"You can see Rama here itself today, when he has been duly permitted by Bharadwajathe sage, after spending, at the instance of the sage, for a night of the fifth lunar day (of thebright half of the month of Ashvayuja)."
6-125-24,"That swift-moving Hanuma, with his rejoicingly feather-like body and with a greatsplendor, not thinking of his fatigue, sprang up with a great speed."
6-125-25,"Hanuma saw, on the way, Ramatirtha, a place of descent into the river (hallowed bythe association of Lord Parashurama), as well as the rivers Valukini, Varuthini and Gomati as alsothe formidable forest of Sala trees, many thousands of people and numerous communities."
6-125-26,"Going quickly for a long distance, that foremost of the monkeys reached trees inflowering, near Nandigrama and looking like those comprised in the garden of Kubera (known by thename, Chitraratha) and frequented by women along with their sons and elders, charmingly adorned asthey were."
6-125-27,"At a distance of two miles from Ayodhya Hanuama saw Bharata, living in a hermitage,with the bark trees and the skin of a black antelope wrapped round his waist, looking miserable andemaciated, wearing matted locks on his head, his limbs coated with dirt, afflicted throughseparation from Rama his elder brother, subsisting on roots and fruits, with his senses subdued,engaged in austerities, protecting virtue, with a very high head of matted hair, covering his bodywith the bark of trees and a deer skin, disciplined, whose thoughts were fixed on the SupremeSpirit, with a splendour equalling that of a Brahmanical sage, ruling the earth after placing thewooden sandals before him, protecting the people belonging to all the four grades (viz. BrahmansKshatriyas, Vaisyas and Shudras) from all peril and attended by the upright ministers, priests andby clever troop-commanders, all clad in saffron robes."
6-125-28,"Those citizens, who were all fond of righteousness, were not willing to enjoypleasures, ignoring that prince clad in the bark of trees and the skin of a black antelope."
6-125-29,"With joined palms in salutation, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke as follows to thatBharata, who knew what is right and seemed to be a second Dharma (the god of virtue) clothed with abody of virtue:"
6-125-30,"Rama, for whom you are repenting residing as he was in the forest of Dandakawearing the bark of trees and matted locks, has enquired about your welfare."
6-125-31,"O Lord! I am telling you a pleasant news. Give up this dreadful anguish. Within awhile, you will be meeting Rama, your elder brother."
6-125-32,"Having killed Ravana and got back Seetha, Rama is returning with his mightyfriends, his purpose duly accomplished."
6-125-33,"Lakshmana too, who is endowed with extraordinary energy, is coming intact withSeetha, the illustrious princess of Videha territory and with Rama as Sachi (the wife of Indra)would with the mighty Indra the lord of celestials."
6-125-34,"Hearing the words of Hanuma, Bharata the son of Kaikeyi, felt delighted and sank allat once to the ground as also fainted through joy."
6-125-35,"Thereupon, Bharata who was born in Raghu dynasty, got up from the swoon within awhile and regaining his consciousness, spoke the following words to Hanuma, who spoke pleasanttidings to him."
6-125-36,"Embracing Hanuma with eagerness, the illustrious Bharata bathed him with copioustear-drops born of delight and as such, other than those born of anguish."
6-125-37,"O the gentle one! Are you a divine being or a human being, who have come here outof compassion? To you, who have given this agreeable news to me, I shall give in return, for thepleasant tidings, a hundred thousand cows, a hundred best villages, and for wives, sixteen goldencomplexioned virgin girls of a good conduct, decked with ear-rings, having beautiful noses andthighs, adorned with all kinds of jewels, with charming countenances as delightful as the moon andborn in a noble family."
6-125-38,"Hearing the news of Rama's arrival resembling a womnder, from Hanuma, Bharata theprince felt overjoyed by a desire to see Rama and spoke the following words again with delight:"
6-126-1,"I am indeed hearing a delight mention of my lord, who proceeded to the vast forestso many years ago."
6-126-2,"This common saying sounds to me good, that bliss comes to a surviving man, even ifit be after a hundred years!"
6-126-3,"How and on what ground, an alliance has been concluded between Rama and the monkeysand at what place? Tell the truth to me, enquiring as I am."
6-126-4,"Seated comfortably on a cushion and interrogated by Bharata, Hanuma thereupon beganto narrate the entire exploits of Rama in the forest."
6-126-5,"O Lord, the long-armed! How your mother was conferred with two boons by yourfather, how Rama was sent to exile, how Dasaratha the king died, with a shocking sorrow for hisson's exile, how you were brought quickly from Rajagriha (the seat of government of Kekaya kings)by the envoys, how sovereignty was not coveted by you when you returned to Ayodhya, how on yourgoing to mount Chitrakuta, your, elder brother the tormentator of enemies was invited by you whofollowed righteousness to take back the kingdom, how Rama who stood by his father's words,renounced the kingdom and stood by his father's words, renounced the kingdom and how your returnedto Ayodhya, taking with you the wooden sandals all this is known accurately to you. Hear from menow, that which occurred after you had returned to Ayodhya."
6-126-6,"When you had gone away, that forest (of Chitrakuta) then assumed a very miserableappearance, with the frightened animals and birds (on seeing strange people there)."
6-126-7,"Rama, thereupon, entered that large, terrific and solitary forest of Dandaka, whichhad been trampled by elephants and extensive with lions, tigers and deers."
6-126-8,"In front of them, even as they were going in that dense forest, there appearedViradha, a demon, uttering forth a very loud roar."
6-126-9,"They cast him, who rushed with uplifted arms towards them, into a pit, turning hishead bent low, and who was emitting a loud cry, like an elephant."
